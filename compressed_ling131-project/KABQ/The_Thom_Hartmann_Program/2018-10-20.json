appeals down at the sharing of food is a richly expressive activity throughout human history and the food not bombs worked followed in this tradition constitute in conduct prohibited or rather excuse me protected under the first amendment\n... the significance of sharing meals with others dates back millennia the appellate courts opinion the Bible recounts that Jesus shared meals with tax collectors centers to demonstrate that they were not outcast in his eyes\nAnd then they actually auto told them to go and said no more right the head and say hey here's some food stamp collecting taxes stealing from people\nThan actually cites a couple of Bible verses quote in sixteen Twenty one pilgrims and Native Americans celebrated the harvest by sharing the first Thanksgiving in Plymouth President Abraham Lincoln established Thanksgiving is a national holiday and Eighteen sixty three were claiming it as a day of Thanksgiving and praised ... father in recognition of blessings and close\nThe appellate court did not rule however on the entire case they simply found that the trial judge was wrong to dismiss it on the grounds that the first amendment didn't apply the appellate court then sent the case back to the trial court again to determine whether the city's ordinance is violate the first amendment\nSo\nThis isn't uncommon for appeals courts to do they did this in the Robin Hood case for instance here in Keene where they don't rule on all of the issues in the case they only rule on errors of law ... appeals courts ultimately are supposed to\nUh to do and it can be it can lead to some confusion when you don't really understand what the court system is doing here so now it's sending it back to the same court that ruled against food not by so the original ruling was\nThat it you know the first amendment didn't apply well now they're saying Oh yes it does rule on this to get right so I don't know what that's going to result in coming from if it's the same judge right who already ruled against them is the same judge going to try to come up with some other you know ... excuse for ruling again\nRight and you you mentioned the Robin Hood\nThing and in that circumstance the superior court said First Amendment allows them to do what they're doing it to a state Supreme Court said All right well look at the case and forget that the whole First Amendment thing exists than just look at it again\n[noise] I don't know if that was an exact recount of ... sad but they said without regard to the first amendment the superior court needs to have another look\nYeah I think that you mean that they were looking at the issue of was at a tour shifts interference with their business activities because that was the the question what was going on for those aren't familiar is here in Keene New Hampshire activists including myself were sued\nBecause we're filling people's parking meters a in advance of the parking attendants are parking enforcers reaching those major so they cannot write tickets so flow mixing their ability to actually write a thousands of tickets\nOver one year timeframe and they got real mad about that and claimed that we were ... interfering with their business the business of finding people write I said no that was a natural business but okay and what the heck on room and the court made the right decision again in our case the lower court was ruling in favor of right or the\nRight there you know that great and the Robin Hood case the court said First Amendment allows them to do the thing right\nAnd then it was the state Supreme Court that said yeah without looking at the first amendment take another look at this and then the superior court took another look at it and said yeah they still have the right to do that and then it went back to the Supreme Court again the Supreme Court and the court said\nYeah okay you're right yeah [noise] Kristen\nAnderson director of litigation for the southern legal counsel and lead attorney for food not bombs in Fort Lauderdale set in a news release the case address the national trend to the criminalization of homelessness through such measures as local bands on the distribution of free food called the court's opinion recognize sharing food with another human being is one of the oldest forms of human expression\nWe think this decision strengthens our mission message to cities across the country they need to invest in constructive solutions to homelessness instead of wasting government resources on punishing people who seek to offer aid\nUnquote Nathan pimp member of Fort Lauderdale food not bombs and one of the name plaintiffs in the lawsuit said\nWe look for or we look forward to continuing our community organizing in Fort Lauderdale we hope where one step closer to something we fought over for many years simply being able to help people without being threatened with arrest by people who should be working with us\nWe're going to a CD Fort Lauderdale interim city

in federal district court when a judge at that time ruled\nThat distributing food was not constitutionally protected expressive conduct with the eleventh circuit court of appeals said the group's distribution events were quote peaceful political direct action and therefore enjoyed First Amendment protection\nThe group quote does not serve food is a charity but rather to communicate a message that society can end hunger and poverty if we redirect our collective resources from the military in war and that food is a human rights not a privilege\nWhich society has a responsibility to provide for all no I don't necessarily agree that food is a right um but let's look into\nThat what it has a a moral right to prevent you from eating food that you have justly acquired right let's talk about

D. to coin dot I. O. as we continue here we were talking about rights and a food not bombs Daryl you\nA little bit of research turns out it goes back to the Nineteen seventies or and I was Nineteen eighty actually uh when they are maybe it was you Chris yeah ah when they did their first protests at the secret\nNuclear power plant in New Hampshire ... I was searching the history of the anti nuclear movement ... okay and that dates back to the fifty is among scientists or the forties among scientists they adopt discussion among\nQuote unquote ville public in the fifties and then the first actual protest in the sixties I'm saying the anti nuclear movement dates back to Nineteen forty five amongst the Japanese yeah I'll give you that\nYeah yeah and and I am I'm not against nuclear there was probably an anti nuclear movement both before that as well yeah during the the first test um you know people were horrified and then I talked to my my father who was alive at this point and\nAnd when the Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened I mean they were horrified at the power that was the common on I think on both sides of of the war that people were like what have we unleashed and this was a common thing of uh among scientists to\nThe idea that this kind of power and I think a lot of people realize that it couldn't be contained just to the U.S you know this was going to change the world forever and it certainly has [noise]\nI I'm not against nuclear power but I Am against nuclear bombs yeah yeah uh\nI think that if we had a true free market in power than you'd find safer smaller less you know radioactive a nuclear facilities and then you do today which is very heavily restricted and you know you can't build new ones and the old ones can't be retrofitted and\nIt's just there was a mess yeah and that's out there so many restrictions on research and things like that you know I'm the there been people that have been playing around with ideas for cold fusion and and you know salt reactors and all sorts of technologies that could really help but and then there's a story\nAnd reactors which are much safer for understanding what's this to a ... story on the has a much shorter half life\nI don't recall I Know we've talked about the differences between uranium and tore him and it's like a night and day difference between you know safety so anyway I'm back to food not bombs and this court case the eleventh circuit court of appeals saying yeah it is First Amendment protected action to distribute food\nThey say here that would not bombs believes that food is a human rights not a privilege well not a problem with the statement like that is that it sounds nice on his face like oh well I mean who could disagree with the right to\nEat but the\nProblem with that type of right is it forces itself upon other people meaning that if you have a right to food then that means that you have a right to somebody going out and picking it off the vine and bring you know putting it in a store or giving it to you\nWrite it all depends on whether you mean positive or negative right right exactly what he's only problems with the English language that I was trying to point out to where the right to bear arms is not construed by anyone as the government must give you all firearms right\nOr that you have a right to go in and just take a firearm from a you know gun store or something 'cause you have a right to it right if you have a right to something that doesn't necessarily follow that means you have to pay to exercise that right like if I have a right to free speech\nA on public property I don't have to pay anybody to speak\nSo when people ask for a permit to engage in their so called free speech but they don't have a right anymore they reverted that right into a privilege right so we get into kind of a real sticky situation here where people have the intention of doing good and helping others and they believe that food is a right but ultimately it's\nIt's not I mean if the if a bunch of people eat all of the food on the the vines or whatever then\nYou know the food and just going to pop right back out to you know provide itself somebody's gotta planted somebody's got to go until the land somebody's got to go and uh and pick the watermelons or whatever it is that you know food that we are talking about here there's a lot of work that goes into getting food packaged and shipped and sent to your plate\nRight so free to air satellite for listeners who aren't familiar is a system that allows satellite broadcast to be received by the viewer or listener for free meaning that right now and you're listening David you're not paying any company per month\nA fee to receive that audio programming from us um it really isn't that expensive in the scheme of things to be up there I Am prohibited by my agreement with the uh the satellite company to tell you exactly how much it is\nBut it's pretty affordable I'm going to say I'm going to tell you that we do it to both sub Saharan Africa there's an ... an African satellite there are as he has five\nAnd then also to North and Central America on galaxy Nineteen the total bill per month is under a grand\nReally for two continents [laughter] um so I mean that's yeah that's not too shabby if you try to buy a time on like a radio station you're going to be paying probably a grand an hour\nOr something like that to you know in a lot more and more in some some radio markets so you're right it's not an entirely popular in the U.S but it's not on used I mean there are hundreds of channels up there\nA A R T is up there al Jazeera used to be but they're not there anymore press TV so there's a number of sort of ... where are the international TV channels\nAnd there are a lot of people even though it is as you mentioned a lot of international channels a lot of Arabic stations there are people that you know they're not uh\nFrom the U.S and if you failed but the only way they can get some of the content that they want is through free to air link and when there's scrolling through channels\nWait what does this there's a learned on FM exactly yeah and the the barriers to entry is really low troops receive these not want to say that it's\nReally low for someone in sub Saharan Africa maybe monthly wages hit us um but I mean I've I've looked into this stuff before butter receivers like ... bucks yeah hundred bucks and you can use almost like any dish\nYou can use a hundred you know a hundred dollar dish or Seventy dollar distant expensive so basically you you're set up and running for two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks yeah um it's really no big deal to to get into it and also it's it also works as a distribution method for our radio stations that take our show\nThat aren't licensed radio stations so if we have a pirate radio station out there\nThat wants to air the content for free talk live or L. R. N. dot at them\nThey can just set up a satellite dish and receiver and they don't have to have an Internet connection live at their uh their their radio station so it's used for that as well and it helps facilitate that so to me I think it's worth it it's a I think it's worth doing and we've been doing it since I think about twenty ten so almost most of the decade so I got a question who regulates\nThe FCC does technically I have some satellite regularly and I'm just just curious like give evict covers\nNorth America and South America does the FCC just claim we're in charge of all this or is it well the FCC but who regulates the tell the ports so ... the ah you know the the the place where there's like a big essentially a company\nThat that takes our show and or I read and then they mix it together and and what they call them ... which is a theory lives her right which is a series of channels that's all broadcast to the satellite and then the satellite rebroadcast sit down across\nContinents or so since that's the transmission facility located in Pennsylvania it comes under FCC\nLicensed in that case but that doesn't mean we're prohibit doesn't mean that content is FCC regular are some things that I think that aren't allowed but it's not the same as like broadcast radio yeah anyway David does that answer your question for you\nYeah yeah and\nLook at it I mean let's ensure an unusual person since you had a free to air satellite ... what was it that attracted you to it\nSo I wear a ... and in ... already a Middle Eastern population um you know it it can be one of the only Muslim majority city that that middle I'm you know cable and Michigan\nI'm\nYou know it's a pretty common thing it right down you know ... ... ... you know they're bigger than like satellite dishes you know ... and you know a quick like like you said it's not like that but you know I think Michael that up\nI I got a dish for free you know I I'm ... and under eight bucks I think there were ... like eight bucks an hour and they had a wreck and like oh my gosh you guys are up there I just thought that was awesome you\nKnow pool yeah I feel as though I'll tell you another aspect of this that I thought was cool years ago I learned that some countries banned satellite dishes yeah ah so Cuba for instance but not just Cuba there's also some Middle Eastern countries that also banned them and uh and so I thought you know\nI liked subversive things\nAnd I love the idea that we're up on a delivery system satellite that basically can't be Jim by any meaningful system that the only way they have to effectively stop people is to target people dishes\nAnd take them out if you if you search Google for satellite dish or destruction or bans or whatever you'll find some horrifying picture right\nOf just uh just I don't know thousands hundreds of satellite dishes that have been confiscated by authoritarian governments that are being crushed by bulldozers and things like that I mean so there really are people who are going to prison\nIn countries for smuggling in satellite dishes um I remember once crazy yeah I remember one story and I think it might've been Cuba where they smuggled them in as though they were like wave boards are boogie boards deciding like anyway they painted them to be all lead writing colored and\nAnd uh and and there was a years ago I read a story about Cuba where what the the way they set it up as one dish will be set up on like in a sort of a obscured location where they can point of the\nUh the satellite but it can't easily be seen from like the ground and then they'll feed that feed from that just a multiple of surrounding houses one dish will feed multiple families in an area 'cause they don't want to have more than one bishop because it increases the likelihood that they're going to get caught a just a fascinating stuff and so I thought you know\nIf we can be up on this satellite the most popular one galaxy Nineteen ... where it's at because there's a bunch of satellites up there for only some of them are sort of the\nThe free to air satellites there's a bunch of 'em to deliver encrypted or scrambled channels on other satellites I thought you know if we can be there with pro liberty pro freedom programming and uh you know\nEven quicker perhaps undermined the legitimacy of these uh these authoritarian states like that's worth you know five hundred bucks a month right to me at least Hey David thanks for calling smack glad you found out there and I appreciate hearing from you want to learn more about our satellite feeds\nYou can go to ... dot L.

you were it yet so lasting eight years I don't think you can necessarily call a failure right so what what are they saying went wrong though a lemonade skipped out because they mentioned a few other locations they say only one\nIn Boston remain it's still operating okay ... uh they say the the concept was designed to be self sustaining the restaurant operated at a loss or read the paper looks at why the cafes did not work in K\n... era was a multi million dollar company and they have a CEO owned all boon ...\nOr ... that set things if you're in its French now it's a French name but it's that really expensive grabbing go thing inside airports this you're saying I think I don't recall her\nYeah ah they have it here with it and but I thought it was a pair and uh but the ... had previously on that thing\nBut yet it was clear for us\nThis again from the paper that he was so aware of how consumers think an act and fill in the marketplace and here's the marketplace in particular that that's why it miss the mark said as soon as a dog show a marketing professor at ... university who co authored the paper\nAnd Yelp reviews of the cafe the researchers saw that many consumers didn't want to eat next to homeless people complained about the atmosphere people who are food insecure also didn't like it though the cafes were intended to provide dignity people could pay as little as they could\nAnd we're ... we're supposed to be questioned about it or made to feel like lesser consumers it didn't work that way um practice the company asked customers to limit themselves to one discounted meal a week or two volunteer an hour at the cafe to make up for the free meals\nThe company said we were not designed to be a permanent solution for those facing food insecurity but that can make things complicated for people who wanted to take advantage of the service plus I mean the idea of\nYou want to have somebody come in and vow to volunteer for an hour in an era I mean the the training that you'd have to go through a loan just to be able to be you know turned loose on food preparation or maybe they were just having them take out the trash I don't know but like that's that's that art handle getting\nDown they mentioned that uh other restaurants that operate in a similar matter have survived OK a company called same a cafe that's an acronym for\nSo all they eat witches in Denver which is a nonprofit restaurant that originally inspired shake is still operating eat\nAcronym for everyone at the table and Philadelphia has been serving pay as you wish that airs for the last two years in Spain guest eating breakfast and lunch at the Robin Hood restaurant foot the bill for others who eat supper karma catching a volunteer run project coast a series of donation only males although\nThat's interesting where you go on the the one where they've got the sort of segregation of\nBreakfast and lunch people pay for the people who eat supper I thought it was interesting that you know you said that some of the parrot customers didn't want to actually eat around homeless people right um I guess they're you know a little uncouth right and their behavior and misery in certain circumstances and\nAh you when you go into open air or at least when I've been in them they they tend to be kind of like an upper middle class looking crowd right\nYeah it's like a a snobby Starbucks has food instead of coffee\nYeah they got coffee to ah yeah I just I just think of it is that it's a middle class want to be more type of place but I Love is that this is another failed experiment and socialists\nAnd and you know it's not so it's not socialism\nIt is voluntary I I understand that I Know that you have a problem with ... narrow because they don't like people to have self defense weapon oh you have is not that they don't like me they don't like my gun so I Choose not to go there and tried but again this idea that um\nBut this isn't socialism the state was not involved at all in this that is true um son voluntary form of wealth redistribution and it didn't work out is\nGoing to fail and and that's why a lot of these other places apparently not yet this reminds me of the conversation we had with Matt Philips when we were broadcasting from the um New Hampshire free state\n... conference I'm about ... he had talked about I'm going out to burning man and how burning man is very much you know a everybody gives away if the economy at a gift and remodeling me there we go\nAnd my comment was that burning man last for what a week yeah to yeah yeah because any longer it would fail saying that it is not sustainable well there are some\nPeople that say the same thing about the uh free economy is that operate at things like pork vast store for fest\nI understand I I think for charities to to function it has to be because people are willing to give and I I think when we try to confuse consumerism or purchasing things with the idea\nThat you're going to be doing some good [noise]\nI don't know I I just when I heard about this to begin with I thought this is gonna crash and burn and it did [noise]\nCrashing are okay but they don't get they ... they operate at

it's very you know it's been very confusing so far you ... you\nYou referenced a rip van Winkle\nA fictional character who fell asleep for a hundred years or whatever it was and then obviously woke up very very confused sort of like ah movies have done this is sort of fish out of water scenario Encino Man of course is a popular one from the Nineteen nineties uh where the same sort of thing happens right\nAnd all kinds of comedy or ensues are ... are a talk show we actually are discord chat or somebody has asked a non jak you asked if you're a time traveler\n\nThank you uh that does shed a little light on the situation\nYou may or may not advise travel ordered it up\nI I I'm not saying I think we just don't think I don't know if I'm at a time travel what I'm saying is\nThe question I have is how to navigate the call in phone listening instead of the word okay we're interested or email or some other medium communication with the talk live so Jackie has a point\nA good point in other words\nIt all you can do it through the discord\nI can do that on us is through the phone I have a\n... but we may understand each other's it works well\nRight but the the the show access that medium that allows one to communicate to another even larger contacting the show through different means you okay you go to the computer models who uses any other means\nSo a lot of the people in the discord chat are listening to the show live\nIt's why they're talking about you right now are in our chat room you can't see what they're saying except for when we select out and share it with you\nBut anybody who wants to join the discord can certainly do that and you don't have to use a real emails severe by the way if you're concerned about anonymity I'm just use a throwaway email address when you joined the discord you can make up any kind of a\nDay and they want to get there are some people that they won't even get on the Internet\nHe's obviously on the Internet how are you listening to the show\nDaryl you get\nThe mail hold on how are you listening to the show\nI'm listening on the telephone\n[noise] so it was a call at ... ... how'd you get that number\nI listened to your show on the call in line for a long time and it's the only way I usually listen to your show\nBut how did you get the number for the call in line in the first place under\nTheir first placed a friend of mine he may have been an answer I don't know but he gave me the phone number and said you ought to go listen to this\nSummer they thought it was interesting and ... either\nGray so I don't get on the Internet you don't get on the Internet at all then\nI Choose let me get a\nA metaphor or another another way to look at the question you that you asked\nYou why this anonymous this anonymous person on the Internet only only adds to the forced to\nWhen forced to so basically you've never gotten on the Internet because why would anyone forty and all\nThat it's not like\nA sample of a time when you were forced to get on the Internet and right now\nLet me let me illustrate this another direction very quickly if you were electricians that understood commercial electronic and house electronic and industrial and gifts from not building motors a very let's say an electrical engineer okay\nAnd then you had a very elegant ... year old boy and you're out\nAnd you say this ... year old boy I'd never put my hand it into a\nLive panel book because it could hurt me good advice alive or not all the breaker or I turn off the main power supply before I put my hand in the ... good in my yes yup okay\nThe himself oh I understand that that's wonderful so I cannot get hurt if I put my head and I don't know about this which and this was this uh-huh\nThen comes back three weeks later some very intelligent person put some automation is now the same switch can be in the same position that by ... or eighty\nOne hell does that has to do is when you were forced to use the Internet [laughter] like Jesus\n... the Internet when I was when I when I could\nTell that it was on and\nSo in other words I don't like it\nSo you dial up modem when you knew when they were caught him on a dial up modem you couldn't be can often to the Internet unless you were connected on your dialogue\nUh you know I mean I can see businesses doing this to garner good press right and that doesn't make it a bad thing is um yeah\nThat same reason Walmart sends a truck full of water down to the hurricane victims explores\nWhy ah the the one a horrible beer company a Bush or Budweiser they will also right or like a week right after some disaster only put actual water instead of beer flavor of water and their cat right and then they send that down to the place that yeah yeah\nAnd that's all fine and and those are good PR moves they garner good press and I and I don't see anything wrong with that I just find this idea to be somewhat disingenuous and and\nWe'll we'll watch that and what what about instead of the pay as you go bottle or the pay it forward model well to where you have to pay full price for your meal\nAnd if you want to you can buy an additional meal and then they'll put a little sticky note on here's the prepaid mills and then if somebody comes in and they don't have money for food they can pull one of the sticky notes off the wall\nI think that's fine because then there is a scarcity if you are out of those then that may prompt more people to put sticky okay and at the same time um you know if if you're hungry and you have an eating maybe you've got to get up a little early to make sure you get a sticking out\nAll I Know is that we talked about a couple of days we talked about same cafe in Denver and we talked about ... it was an affiliate ... in Philly\nAnd I tried to do a little bit of research is to see where these where they're getting their funding from right and the first thing we looked at was eat and it looked like they were tied in with a college Drexel University in Philly ... college fund which right there's probably some state money coming in there somewhere yeah\nAnd then I go look at the one ah same cafe in Denver and it doesn't take a lot of lives a private college oh really okay but\nThe I don't a lot of private colleges still take state money 'cause\nThey if I take state money I mean that they allow people with student loans and Pell Grants that yes they take state money right but I I'd be funded the same way the ... State University system is funded by the state I'll keep\nDigging into that but when I look at the same cafe in Denver a day except donations and things like that but they also get donations\nThrough their community partners like certify bleed green Denver which if you click on the link here it takes you to the city of Denver if you go to Denver botanical gardens a which is another funding source then there's\nNo ties to local government they they they just got a Seventeen\nMillion dollar bond to expand their parking through the city of Denver\nSo it doesn't take too many steps before these things that sound really good really um you know sort of homegrown or subsidize they are subsidized at some level through government and that means that people that may not approve of the same programs are actually funding these programs\nAnd it also likely means they're not sustainable if the right to be subsidized that's usually why yeah um so\nYeah and yeah and most restaurants are sustainable\nWell that's true that's true but the ones that are they work out and they stick around for a long time yeah and these habits so it's interesting it's interesting and maybe if they were doing it the way Darryl suggested or maybe there are ways to make\nIt right there there are restaurants that do the pay it forward ... ah there's a story from CBS seven out of big spring Texas about a restaurant out there the Mayo sauce family died or\nThey got the idea after reading about a Chicago pizza parlor that sells one dollar slices of pizza and they encourage people to today at forward and hey I pay for three slices I only want to get yeah\nMakes sense and again I'm not saying it's impossible for one of these models to uh to work out\nInteresting to find out whether they do or they don't just and are these are the things that can be tried in a if there's a free market right you know where you don't have a insane government regulation standing in the way raising costs because it's not cheap to start a restaurant right and a lot of that\nCost is because of the government and all of its mandates that they put on restaurant tours and start ups from you know getting started it can prevent somebody from being able to let's say open up a restaurant in their own home for where they would be able to serve people for a much lower cost and\nA and you know and ... and add more competition into the marketplace right um unfortunately the government stands and the way and ultimately protects the existing restaurant tourists who have put in the two hundred thousand dollar you know vent hood or whatever it is they have to put in these crazy mandates on her bed\nTo upgrade an existing kitchen to a commercial kitchen cost about half a million dollars yeah that sounds about what I've heard from so and I've never actually looked into it you know Ryan imagine all the uh just uh just so difficult right and ... and we actually know a guy that he was trying to open a restaurant that\nIt was going to be a pickled style restaurant where nothing was actually going to be cooked I saw him recently and he still after spending like a hundred thousand dollar you know oh I Am doing all kinds of stuff to meet some arbitrary decisions\nWound up realizing that he was never going to get approved yeah he gave up yet they hold of it you have to put a double firewall between the kitchen area\nAnd the serving area you'd even I'm not cooking anything nothing at any time it's ever going to be producing heat and they said well you might use a microwave at some time so yeah let's just do a single firewall instead of a double\nI saw him actually at the bit clean heretic spent the night that uh the the last night out of the ... he actually came out to that and he was telling me about that smell like how's your wrist restaurant going to go you know that doesn't work out after I spent my life savings are trying to make it work out because they bought the building\nThat they were rented any right 'cause you can't just easily go in and renovate somebody else's building right without you know some serious negotiations so they own this property and now they're renting it out to some other whatever it is that they're running out though so it's like\nYou know it's not a total loss but ultimately they lost a ton of money via are trying to jump through the regulatory hurdles to ultimately no avail yeah how many times does that happen to people you ever hear about right there's all this you can see all the restaurants that open and fail but what about the ones like you're talking about where there's just this they did you ever\nEven made it a grand opening right up and then pour a bunch of money in and then just have to call it quits yup sad\nSo the toll free number here tonight eight fifty five four fifty free still come here uh Darryl we actually intended to talk about another homeless related story and\nThat is very out of Ohio where there's a property owner not a homeowner he owns the poverty and he's fighting to allow the homeless to stay on his problem what he thinks his his property yeah because if it were your property you wouldn't have to find anybody aware enough to\nAsk in the first place or will continue with what's going on there 'cause this actually happened here in Keene New Hampshire a few years back\nAnd I

similar situation involving himself we do um do ... model Sylvia\nOh oh oh right he had the audacity to stay in he has a camper right there at all you hang our hat her at a fire on his property prior to him purchasing prior and burned down\nThe house yep so garage left right and the state or the city in this case so they're not alleging that he committed arson to burn down the building he wasn't even there at that time but uh yeah OK I'm Glad you brought that up because I thought you were going to be referring to the state representative former state rep here in Keene who actually has used his property\nOr behind the Hannah for grocery store to allow homeless encampments in and basically ran up against this exact same problem but I don't believe took it to court whereas this guy in Akron is taking it\nBut the guy you're talking about that's involved in an issue right now is not only a state representative he's also a listener and a longtime supporter of free chocolate yes and an apple a fire we gave out a couple of nights ago and uh and the top\nA number one most liberty oriented state rep according to the New Hampshire liberty alliance he won the are representative of the year whatever award for us and and that was after years of getting a pluses so he's been amazing the whole time I go to weed out here's a resolution to his thing because I had airing a few weeks ago\nA ... he did not tell me and I asked ... to keep me in the loop and he said that he would in that particular case but to\nTo recap what's going on with him the house burned down before he bought the property he bought the property probably at a pretty good deal um and there's a lot of the house and they had a garage on it and he parked in RV there\nAnd the town government even though there's no neighbors like immediate ... he's in the woods right there's no like neighbors immediately around at least from what we could tell by like a satellite photo\nUm somehow you know the town decided they didn't like him probably because of his politics 'cause he's a liberty guy and they targeted him they specifically asked the zoning enforcement officer to target his property when this guy came on board with the job that he ... he told the news media that it was the town selecting it\nWho had instructed hip to go after my Sylvia property\nUm and he did and he threatened him and he said uh I Believe that you're living on this property in violation of blah blah blah whatever ordinance or zoning et cetera now we don't\nHe doesn't know for sure then my living there right he only saw Mike exit the RV Ron occasion he saw smoke coming from a chimney in the garage so he believes that Mike is living on the property he saw shoveled pathways or during the winter ...\nThey do that Mike lives on the property because that's what he has listed as his dome asylum and has a place for where he's registered\nTo vote yeah I don't think it's going to likely when this on a argument over the facts um but either way you know this is a fundamental attack I write to the question\nIs whether or not he is living\nPartially in the RV and partially in the uh garage type thing without some kind of occupants of your life and that's\nThe legal question and play but the real question is\nShouldn't you be able to do what the hell you want to do on what is right purportedly your own property what exactly is an occupancy license to live on property that you're supposedly own it's crazy yeah it's insane which is why I suggested to make that maybe if he gets re elected a year in November that he should have all that if you will to abolish\nZoning entirely can we just had that please to where it just because New Hampshire is a state\nRun kind of government there's no home rule the towns can only do what they're allowed to do by state government\nAnd obviously the state has allowed for zoning was time for the state to disallow zoning and abolish it entirely from across the entire state of New Hampshire problem solved there you go yeah unfortunately I don't know if he's going to I Hope he does 'cause it would be awesome I Would love to have that conversation because in New Hampshire every\nBill that is put forward by all the four hundred state representatives and are they for senator there's hundreds and hundreds of bills every uh every year every one of them has to have a public hearing and I would love to see the bureaucrats come out and make an argument as to why zoning is necessary not oh they'll do it and I say that they will yeah\nI'll say that as a member of a planning board yeah um they will tell you that you know without planning um then you're going to have a all sorts of crazy businesses next to 'em you know residences and it it just ends up being insane and you can\nWhen I when I may call not yet mayor of Houston how's the voting thing work out of the largest city in the United states you might be the seven oh good okay thank you write\nA how about the uh the cities or towns are all towns that don't have the owning a graft and doesn't have it ... doesn't have it there's others I just don't know what they are everybody else with their ... and said they
