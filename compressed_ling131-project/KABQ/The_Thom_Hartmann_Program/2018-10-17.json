fine\nBut it's not about the money at all the money is\nThis is about teaching people a lesson and civility we can't have people\nSaying things you know that whole freedom of speech thing of Brian Murphy on behalf of the Myrtle Beach police department issued the following statement quote a person would violate ordinance fourteen hundred and sixty one be one if he or she uses language likely to provoke a violent reaction from another person\nThe ordinance list several examples the types of words which are unlawful\nThe penalty for conviction could include a fine and or jail time we encourage everyone to avoid violinist ordinance by speaking to others with the same respect and kindness that he or she deserves trying to turn to town into a kindergarten now what I'd like to know is I mean I Do want to find out more about exactly what\nThey mean here because you know using the F. word or the S. word or you know words we can't say on on the air here well there's a lot of circumstances where those aren't designed to provoke a violent response so is it just like\nI'm going to ask and hurt you that's what's banned because they are going to ... you\nSay you're going to hurt someone is illegal anyways I think they\nPut her your at your ethnic ugly or something like that I mean does that's what is it\nI suspect right I mean I unless it says I don't know I suspect it's to avoid it if like let's say there was a cop walking by and someone drops a an Advil under foot or something and they say a bad word like you know Tom and Jerry stuff\nI think it's just so that doesn't happen or if like you know a cop is trying to get someone to a stop resisting he could stop ... resisting and you'll hit the person a bunch of times and they won't get in\nTrouble ... the cops are almost always exempt from the very ordinances that uh they frequently are enforcing I Do have the ordinance actually pulled up here so we'll see exactly you know what what some of the the claims are but on the on its face um this is an unconstitutional\nClearly are just absolutely wrong and unconstitutional ordinance\nOh a cop threatened me with an cocker and I just laughed in his face and he was arrested for profanity well not a ... he said I was there during it was very much for twenty four twenty protest and was a\nA you know Rob from Vermont said said it use that to have a gun control protests and said oh this is BS and the cop is like\nA cop and say hey you know watch it but ah and I was like ... like you know there's a there's an ordinance again I said well I'm I think it was a decency or whatever they call it and I said well has not been like shut down in court a bunch of times he was like yeah but it also hasn't and I said like some bad words behind them and he he didn't do anything\nGuarding

peace\nIn light of surrounding circumstances of time place or nearing its of other persons by making honoring or directing toward another person any lewd\nObscene or profane or libel is expletive or epithets or fighting words which as a matter of common knowledge when addressed to the ordinary citizen are inherently likely to provoke violent reactions\nIncluding but not limited to calls threats and invitations to immediately engage in physical violence this fisticuffs dual or personal combat\nI bet they added the luge just to get the feminists on board\nBut it does say here the ... or anything that is\nUh let's see lewd obscene or profane so it's not just about fighting words it's about anything that they think\nWould make someone wants to fight you which that's a fairly large range of things I mean does it because there's some violent people out there who they don't take it being insulted real kindly and\nThis is essentially ... is the hecklers veto the right\nUh example there's a certain type of courtroom\nOr terminology for the hecklers veto the idea that you shouldn't be able to say something because somebody's going to hurt you or somebody's going to do something violent in response to you right so the idea is\nIf somebody hits you because you say ... and I don't like your eh thing here it's really ugly and you just take you take a swing at me because it's you know you took a lot of time to style your hair and you know you think it looks pretty nice and your girlfriend told you that it looks pretty nice but I hurt your feelings so you decided to take a swing at me attacked me over that\nI'm Sorry but you're the one who's in the wrong of supposedly because you know this is ... here we are again we're back to pre school a sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me this is the way that adults are supposed to handle their conversations when somebody is\nA instigating or attempting to instigate with you on the streets the appropriate thing to do is to not escalate that situation and the violence but the D. escalated but instead hear what this ordinance does is it is it blames the speaker essentially for the actions\nOf the supposed victim of the speech like oh if somebody is likely to get mad and attack you and violate the law because that would be an actual\nBattery against another human being\nA then you get arrested as well just simply for saying words that are considered to be profane or epithets or or libel is expletives\nEight fifty five four fifty free unfortunately ordinance is like this have to

Thirteen\nWhile I heard the I mean I've I I remember being in a a local bar here one of the crypto currency accepting of places here in town and actually talking with a UPS driver who claimed he was making like thirty something bucks an hour is it ...\nScenario already at the top rate driver rate is very good okay but for that that that's for the start in rape per like warehouse employees more comparable to Amazon and I see you have a ... you're talking about the jobs where it's people throwing packages\nIn the world we don't ... them\nAnd so automated already you know is it a lot of it is but I I wanted to talk about\nLike the union very strongly pushes against right to work [noise] they push for exclusive representation and it's interesting that a lot of my co workers that are more the Democrat leaning people are now saying you know what can we do know that union ignored our boat and the answer is because you push those laws not\nLike we can't replace a union you're not allowed to use the anybody but am I an act that it's called at least that representation or you use that union and you can't replace them and you know for the people that are in the states that don't have a right to work they don't have the opposite of what's wrong so you do in your area or you say any\nIf you're in a state with right to work [noise] what does that mean for you like you cry goodbye to the union and then be a non you had an employee\nIt's a it's a process but you can uh stop paying dues and because they have exclusive representation they still must represent you\nIs that she had a hard thing is the effects in France edition of federal concept\nYes so they pushed that through because otherwise you know the company for say hey you can join this other union and we'll pay you five dollars more you know they could break up the union that way\nSo what how do they in the ah what happens in the contract expires then [noise]\nTo and use it in real life you can buy things in real life I just actually had lunch today are at local barbecue food truck called hot dogs I paid for that would dash\nAnd the day before that I bought something else who crypto and I'm frequently using crypto currency in real life and so we kind of went through it was an hour long panel we went through some of the reasons why New Hampshire is very very special\nAnd very unique when it comes to not only spending crypto in real life but some of the other cool things that we've got going on here like the crypto currency protection\nA legislation that came about within the last couple of years as well so if you want to check that video out actually it's been on ...

C. where I actually got legalized interestingly let's cut all the politicians want to do it there while whoever it is a lobbyist and\nBad people well they were doing it anyway just they want to do it legally right out in the open yeah um well I don't know if it's legal out in the open I don't know if it's ... and a lot of these places like\nIn Colorado you can't legally smoke it outdoors how many people violate that ah ordinance I I'm not sure but it's\nThere's not really a truly free place for using and possessing Canada as they all have a bunch of rules apply to them or we saw story and I we didn't get into the details on it but in a Colorado\nThere were multiple raids against unlicensed grows a so they're still targeting people who are operating in the black market people who don't want to go and jumped through the hoops and get the government licenses and all that so Canada is ahead of I think you know the United states and Mexico as far as the national level\nDecriminalization or legalization but I agree with you Vincent de it's going to be laughable or legalization because oh it's it's Sylvia ... yeah right it's centrally planned legalization and so the government while they're not going to grow the we'd themselves they have specific contractors for whom they will be doing you know the government gross\nAnd is that there's no competition amongst the growers\nWhich means that the weed is likely going to be some of the weakest most pathetic kind of wheat available out there on the market at least that was some of the claims originally back when Canada went through medical a candidate is was the medical patients were like this you know this we'd sucks this is ditch we'd\nWith some of the comments that uh that we'd seen\nMichael did you want to hear more from the their story the irony here is that I brought this story up but uh I don't even smoke candidate right right that's what they all you know I I really haven't I ah quit in Nineteen Ninety five and have an ... substance so you had you have used I have\nNoticed that in the past okay you you do know it has gotten better I mean if you want to\nWrite a site or a ... that's probably another ... I I I got hold of some pretty good stuff yeah they had good we'd back in the Nineteen nineties\nJust might have been a little harder to come across\nSo where was the story you had something that you were ... there was there was one\nStory that really struck me that uh that I thought we should talk about a little bit sure nearly eight and ten Canadians are interested in smoking cannabis wants to legalize huh [noise]\nA survey conducted for see t._v. news this comes from the TV news in Canada found that Seventy one percent of those polled were not interested in smoking marijuana once it's legal in Canada\nSeventy one percent isn't quite eight out of town and I'd rather still alive another eight percent said they were somewhat not interested or whatever that means [laughter] and eleven percent said they were somewhat interested or an eight percent said they were interested in smoking marijuana of only ... and two percent were unsure\nOnly eight per se but I but isn't this thing this is addictive this addictive monsters we'd bed you know get people to be just one second spoken a joined an extra shooting up heroin I don't buy it I don't buy that there's only eight percent in Canada or do you think there's still\nLike some kind of negative connotations surrounding the Afghan yeah you just don't want to do it\nThe street and says vis a poster neck nano so I don't know if I got his name right but some of them will correct me if I didn't ... says the results of the survey reflect the currents smoking culture and Canada\nYou know the market provides these cool incentives and you know first and things that you know they're trying to uh one up on another right like if you're in the market\nAnd you can have the ability to legally sell marijuana tomorrow but not today probably a good chunk of those stores are going to want to open up at midnight to take advantage of those first timers the people that want to get out there and actually buy marijuana for the first time legally not that they're buying marijuana for the first time\nBecause all these people have already been violating the law this was just going to make it so they aren't going to get arrested for carrying what was it up to thirty grams a you have well you guys pulled up the restrictions on this or that was about an ounce\nYeah so for a I got I got it here\nI had it here oh here we go you so um it'll be sold in one gram three and a half ... and eight Fifteen grand formats with a maximum of thirty grams per visit and to match the legal limit a person\nWill be allowed to have on them a hundred and fifty grams is the limit per household sort of your roommates or husband and wife whatever their kids\nHundred and fifty grams you know that's a lot of weight I think that's probably more than sufficient for the average person a thirty grams certainly is going to keep you busy for a while um you would cited earlier off the air the cost per gram was going to be over five can is it five Canadian dollars\nIt has a US dollars symbol on it but it's the Montreal Gazette so it just says five twenty five grams so I'm assuming that we're going to be US Navy and I think it'd be OK some some of her articles I've seen a interest hassled Canadian dollars simply because the ... no no no no that's ... that's the dollar sign the dollar sign out yeah the same\nUm either way I mean with the tax it's probably going to like whatever you know whatever exchange rate\nNot tax price so the way it is it five something about what was the five what it was five twenty five twenty five ... tax or does it\nDoes say yes T H A T whatever they have you back in ... the virtues of provincial tax was federal tax in some parts of Montreal I think we might even be a city tax I mean that's got to be the worst\nI Know they have that New York's out here when I was in fact the last time I visited via via Murray shop and um or what what was left of it and on the way right after ... and all on the way there's plenty of uh plenty of science right from closed down shops and it said in French uh we had to close down because the mayor of things you get taxed businesses into oblivion\n... I just find out what happened to market Murray I they uh pled guilty and were given probation probation on December of two thousand Seventeen\nYeah they had him up against the wall I mean they had all kinds of charges that um 'cause they'd opened up multiple stores simultaneously um and he was a really palsy move right basically just saying hey their point was it was it was a really smart and interesting point they were making like\nCanada's legalizing it we're just going to do it now like why should we wait for all these politicians to you know screw around and figure out all these stupid rules and here you go let's just sell some weight while he just opened up the door selling dozens\nOf ... and it's so respect the institution of Canadian democracy even though it's a constitutional monarchy in the queen could override in a thing\nBut they she probably won't get all of a not not in this case but in the past they have one of the ... when when the prime minister Stephen Harper Bush of Canada was about to be voted out of power in a parliament they she had the governor general just dissolve parliament for the day wow\nSo in this case they're gonna make a butch money off yeah oh yeah they're not going to be you know ... they're not they don't want to let anybody else in they don't want to let the marketplace handled this even though it's going to be real quick\nBefore we find out when we find out that they can't handle it they're not gonna be able to handle the demand they're going to be shortages and then of course the black market is going to continue to fill that demand ed and I know a somebody said earlier and I don't think it was I don't think was on the air 'cause we were just kind of talking about this off the air earlier\nOr that the Canadian government was estimating they would only be able to fill thirty percent\nOf the demand in the black market like\nWanting outside of that yeah but yeah I I got to hear Montreal give that to be a s Q DC which is going to be the state's orbit sells it expects to sell approximately fifty tons of cannabis and its first year which would replace about\nReplace about thirty per se um just got ... votes or thirty percent of the black market the number of this s Q D.C outlets will reach twenty within the next few months Fifteen next year and a hundred hundred and fifty over next year's presumed is it a three year plan\nThat presumes they have any real idea of what the black market is like right like how would the government really know I mean every now and then they'll they'll interdict some we'd ride they'll catch somebody crossing the border or they'll a bus to grow operation or they'll catch a dealer with you know a hundred pounds or something like that\nAll they can really do is make estimates based off of there evidence that they have right I mean they're not catching all of it they just are not no not even a you know and and the thing is they don't know what fraction they're catching so they know how much they're catching but they don't know how much that is compared to how much there is being consumed\nYou can do a poll though as we heard earlier\nOnly eight percent are claiming that they're actually going to smoke cannabis after it's legal which I don't buy for a for a moment but even if if it even if it was a present then you'd still have to pull further to ask people what their consumption habits are because some of them are going to smoke\nOnce a week you know on the weekend or something like that others are going to smoke monthly some are going to smoke every day day six times a day so you know how do you figure out exactly what the consumption is going to be the only way to know is going to be to actually measure the demand through the marketplace\nWhen we can finally have that information because in the black market all that stuff silent it's all quiet it's all hush hush it's if it's anywhere it's on a private ledger amongst thousands of dealers and in any given province\nAnd so we're going to find out real fast I think it's going to be interesting to see how quickly they run out of stock\nProvince or territory remember of adverse territory's in Canada right right or uh how many of the provinces versus territory you know off the top of your head is ten provinces five territories voters three\nLet me so I'm not a very good Canadian right [laughter] a difference between a province in a territory is it like kind of the difference between Puerto Rico and Florida\nIs is I think there is not enough people in the territory like like nana but ah which which got its name because when explores one very went to the indigenous people and they say how uh how much of his land is habitable and the indigenous replied none of it\nWow [laughter] that's a joke there but uh you know I think it's like made it like a ... of the provinces like northwest surgery you call and uh none of it it's um the people it's just not very habitable and not very many people want to go there it's mainly a lot of order a Canadian or ...\nFirst name in either basically first nations the and in in\n... in and said I like a ... no they're not able to write you is that a politically correct term for ...\nNo ... no I mean very you know nations that people who lived here before us wherever called first nations in the U.S recalled the Cherokee Nation beholden to solve the euro clause\nIndian like an insulting kind of a non ... the term from what I understand\nIn the U.S in Canada it's America and the Arabs who sets the French um envy us some some Native Americans they pride themselves of Indian but I mean it's just it's an inaccurate terminal 'cause you have\nThe whole subcontinent fully India's near ya yeah All right so we got more on the way here we can talk about a Canadian candidate is legalization which I'm predicting is going to be a disaster\nUm but you know maybe it will be not quite a disaster but it's going to be nowhere near as good as it could have been if they've actually allowed the marketplace to handle is working up your moments eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom this is ...\nAre changing the circus of politics healthcare is

listening to talk ... got ... at age ... or fifty by that age have five four fifty three\nDial on it so free want to talk about candidate for legalization in Canada is happening real soon like tomorrow apparently some\nPlaces you will be able to purchase it in stores others you will not at all not at all to order online\nAnd somebody will deliver it to you apparently\nCan have more than a thirty grams in your own personal possession you cannot have more than a hundred and fifty grams per household\nOr you can ah let's see there's going to be different age restrictions in different provinces many at age Nineteen a couple of Eighteen and so although there's talking comeback about\nCracking up to Twenty one because apparently the comeback province but I recall correctly when we talked about this over the summer was actually one of the most conservative of the provinces trying to put as many restrictions as possible on the campus there\nAnd they've got to serve it of government now ... ... well I actually I did a concert is really mean much I think it it also has a huge nanny state just because they um there's something called the quiet revolution wherever thing in Quebec used to be run by the Catholic Church voluntary thing but you know they would run the hospitals and schools\nAnd in the government came in in the sixties by for 'em live ask I think it was that was a prime minister and they basically everything was taken control of by the government and because they could depend on tax money from the oil\nProvinces and all that sort of came back is seen as one gigantic leads right on a lot of his supporters for a comeback to leave\nThe uh could leave Canada or ...\nOr you know people from like a Alberta and stuff who have to pay for ... free health care free a free medicine\nSo they're like get out so yeah so it was only ... use of a ... it's like that's the thing very used to big government but except the thing is we're used to other people paying for it right and like because they have there there are a minority right and there's I Believe even being a comeback or is a protected group by the United nations or something so used to having for language and forced by by the government\nAre you still yeah yeah so it's a big debate bay like big government because it's mainly a benefit to them\nRight and the the comments I'd seen from their bureaucrats ah that were administering this program or you know again treating cannabis as though it's dangerous drugs it needs to have the strictest controls placed on it\nAnd uh that's this government sort of mentality that's been around for so long and it still continues even in the face of all the evidence that shows that it's actually beneficial to so many people for medicinal purposes that it doesn't actually do really anything of significance as far as you know endangering people\nUm it's one of the most harmless drugs out known\nDrugs it's not even a drug and it's a plant to plant that has chemicals in it and chemicals that can alter your state of conscious you know I'm just saying like when people say ... when people say drug right they think of somebody I think of something cooked up in a lab right in\nThe eyes of drafts brand is like in my view aspirin is worse than a is worse for your body than wheat and I think the one thing that a lot of the kill you Canadians all over should be asking their employees is a you know members of parliament and the government is if this thing is as dangerous as you're saying it is why are you selling it and trying to make money off of it\nBut they finally came to the conclusion they could actually make more money by selling it rather than a you know cracking down on it\nOh absolutely and and and the rats and and and and that that's the thing that people and and this is what frustrates me in the U.S and Canada all over workers have people who are up in arms on marijuana or excuse me right cannabis marijuana as a propaganda term to invoke racist anti Mexican sentiment cannabis as the scientific or\nIs that it's just one it's just one gigantic a hoax as a fraud like just a hundred years ago people could go to the general store and buy canvas to be able to make things out of cannabis it'd be good for 'em [noise]\nIt'd be good for like buildings and stuff and then they just see a special interest groups decided to yo you legalize it just so and it's all very much at all about money it's all about greed money and control that he will do any of that because they're just a bunch of people and to get hurt and buy a wolf she will get\nTo the NBC mean here in a in a little bit but Michael other or we go to your calls you were about to share a a a quote from the border patrol spokes bureaucrat within the United states uh excusing their behavior of banning people from Canada for life\nOr because they admit that they've smoked cannabis often enough by whatever some arbitrary measure so basically it's all going to be up to the border guard the individual border guard at the individual border guard asks you as you're coming into the United states from Canada so you've been smoking some of the legal we've\nHow often have you been smoking that legal ... well I'm going to determine based on what you've said that you have a chance a good chance of smoking some we'd while you're in the United states and that's against federal rule so therefore you're banned forever or so there was a quote\nComing is oh there are multiple quotes here or a condo and a senior official at US Customs and border protection\nSays if\nIf someone had missed a smoky frequently in Canada that will play into the officers admissibility decision about whether they think on this specific trip there are also likely to engage in smoking marijuana in the United states as well he goes on and says\nIt's now legal in Canada so it comes down to whether the officer believes they may engage in same activity while in the United states based on the intent and purpose of their trip as opposed to the legal engagement in Canada\nAnd there's a damn good if they're a user in Canada that they're going to find\nA way to use it in the United absolutely oh it gets better as a global the global news that ca goes on and they say however us border officials will make a distinction between whether Canadians past marijuana use was before or after legalization ...\nSo ah the customs and border protection officials says when they are questioning by the officer during the interview process if illegal drug use comes up it could come down to pre legalization or posts legalization and the officer will make the corresponding decision about admissibility based on\nHow they're not saying what the factors are going to how they're going to factor into their decision\nThey never do they never do that so that's all opaque you're not you're not supposed to know\nLike the idea that if you did it while it was illegal you're also civil disobedience person and so therefore you're less desirable but generally are still less desirable because you're still doing something the federal government considers to be illegal I\nMean it's just bizarre and I I ... I well you know I Will say this just to be okay like constructive as someone who's been across the border back and forth for many many times do you want to avoid a lot of like the harsher border patrols\nOr what you got to do is find a small border towns like yo in Vermont and suddenly go for their cause I even on the American side were burned it tore a spur you see the Canadian Canada side just as where you're coming from where you're going how you plan to say you know it goes by the U.S side it's like backed\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave were the founders of bombers makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we've sold them donated over eight million pairs\nYes donated\nWhy we learned that socks or the number one most requested clothing argument homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and so a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available\nLike the soft as in most comfortable cotton getting rid of what wasn't working\nLike that annoying cos team you could probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and inventing a few new covered innovations along the way like arch support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nAt work people tried them love them told their friends about helping us selling donate over eight million pairs\nTry them now at ... dot com slash Stephanie and get twenty percent off your first order that to be out and be a ask dot com slash and that many bombs dot com slash death any\nWell you know what's not smart jobs sites that overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes you know it is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Stephanie\nUnlike other jobs ... doesn't wait for candidates to find you did you ever go to find them for you it's powerful mapping technology scans thousands resumes identifies people with the right skills education experience where your job and actively invites them to apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast no more sorting through the wrong resumes no more waiting for the right candidates to apply\nIt's no wonder zip recorded his rated number one by employers in the U.S this rating comes from hiring sites on trust pilot with over one thousand reviews and right now check this out my listeners can try zip recorded for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter dot com slash Stephanie that says if recruiter dot com slash Stephanie\nThat zip recruiter dot com slash S T e P H A N I eat what do you have to lose try it for free that ... the smartest way to higher\nPay our listeners\nHave you been putting off replacing your homes old drafting windows and doors like I have well now's the time I hardest partner with renewable by Anderson to offer our listeners and exclusive special on replacement windows and doors\nRight now tax die hard to nine six seven one for or visit I Har renewal dot com and you'll receive an extra five hundred dollar gift card towards your project ... only ... only available to our listeners and you must text I heart\nThan nine six seven one for or visit I hard renewal dot com to capture this exclusive offered\nRenewable by Anderson windows or up to Seventy percent more energy efficient than do windows in the summer\nThey will save your money on your energy bill sects IRC nine six seven one for her visit I our renewable dot com to receive an extra five hundred dollar gift card towards your project\nWhen do\nKnow for city blocks of saving for days fun blocks over for us to quality unlawful [noise] this is Jack was select GMC Shira S.

C. O.\nJust can't stand anybody to have anything if they're not a millionaire\nIt it seems that that's the case I I think that there's actually a a deeper philosophical argument that the conservatives are making to themselves I don't know just think this I mean you can read it and Russell ... book the conservative mind and and numerous other publications over the years they used to be much more upfront about this William F buckle used to talk about this right out loud\nWhich is that if you have a stable and secure middle class the conservatives feel or worry that that will lead to social instability it'll do it'll lead the thing is this is what what Russell Kirk predicted in Nineteen fifty one\nWas as the middle class was starting to emerge as a result of FDR's policies that if the middle class got strong enough you would see women demanding equal place in the workplace\nYou would see young people refusing to uh to honor their elders\nAnd uh I I forget the list but there was you know there's a couple of things there that you know that he laid out basically and sure enough it happened I mean you know in the sixties they legalize birth control pills in sixty one and boom you had the the women's movement\nAnd uh they legalized abortion and Seventy three and and and throughout that the you know two decades era more or less you had young people refusing to go to Vietnam and all of all the Republican sat around and go after Ross Ross or Kirk was a profit we've got to destroy this middle class and turn these people back into the working poor so they will just shut up and go to work\nAnd you know stop voting stop pass away now stop protesting stop demanding things and and we can get on the about the business of getting rich\nAnd that's what's going on in my opinion girl\nAnd and ... and and uh the current occupant of the White House is doing that in a different way with all of this craziness I I scream every night at MSNBC for\nTalking as if this is a normal man you know she is not team he will never be he is not going to change he's Seventy two years old hits carved in stone what he is laid out and nothing that he is made of it's very nice I almost\nHad up that the other night alley got gal she who's substituting I think for Lawrence\nO'Donnell yeah called something that Donald Trump said ally yeah on the air\nAlley though she is is is solid I mean you know he's he's a ... as a journalist he you know it used to work for al Jazeera and ah you know he's ... he's been around the block easy and he's ... he's a Canadian immigrants to the United states\nAnd he you know he gets he gets all kinds of stuff and he will he will speak the truth\nI'm a you know on occasion and I you know I have a lot of respect for him as a journalist ah although I Would still like to see these so called liberal network actually be liberal and actually have liberals on instead of just anti Trump Republicans but yeah I'm with the girl I didn't move along but thank you for the call and thanks for listening to us there in St Paul Jesse in Miami how does it have Jessie what's up\nPlay hard job so much or I Want to do basic used to use the book surely should you know [laughter] I don't mean not the\nYeah are you exactly what was your who don't matter you\nKnow actually is exact quote was Ronald Reagan taught us the deficit so\nOr in what he was saying was re and it was the first guy to do the to Santa Claus theory triple the national debt while he was an office and then as soon as he left the Republican started screaming that the Democrats needed a got Social Security\n...\nOkay thanks for what's behind ...

[noise]\nTheir license number two states analyst consumer insist on or number thirty thirty\n[noise]\nWhat about Jonah Nashville, Tennessee age on what's on your mind that I\nDo much calm so much I called her new show late to say that ah I've been taking every since I'm a Trump was elected\nAnd he started doing the things that he is doing that and as soon as he is the ah found the case of America without the thin veneer of a ... pie and\nA democracy and fairness um the way I see it is that um\nIf you look at each country will each each society and for prime ankle and that the very top of decrying all it's very small and there's a limited number of people who can it at the top\nAnd you can look at that configuration across countries and society\nAnd so basically what you have is the people at the top relate to each other\nOpposed to relating to the people at the bottom of the pyramid and whatever country also try to you want to look at\nWell I Would say most double not all of them and what whites are experiencing now is one black people live only experienced in this country\nAnd so what I say is welcome to our world and I'm not saying that to be pejorative in any way although I don't apologize for being angry because I deserve to be angry but what I'm saying\nIs that when the rest of society looks at whoever they had marginalized and they accept\nThe ill treatment of the marginalized\nThey don't seem to realize that eventually that fame negative behavior is going to move in towards them\nYou're a rich do not care about the poor they never have if you look at European society before they came over here to the continent of what they're calling America\nPaul whites majority as badly as ed on down there and there weren't any black people for them to play and this is what they're going for the game and they seem to be whining towards it seems as though anything that hurts black people\nPay a fine line with even if it means they have to suffer the cheap\nYeah as long as they get a half a crumb war than black people they're satisfied if the rich white state the whole loaf of bread I can understand that and you are historian and I think I read\nSomewhere that in the beginning\nPoor white and black people into marriage live together\nYeah there was a fair amount about up in the earliest decided\nThat they would put a wedge between those two groups tell the whites that failed a lot late with rich fight\nAs to which I think the same way about poor white as tall white seal about black people there and they just can't seem to come together\nDown in the technique that rich white you use is very successful and they continue to use it and they should because it's successful all you have to do is give one group\nI F crumble up any other group or even with a group give some factions within that group a few more crimes than the rest of the group and you've you've wipe out whatever\nGoal directed against\nThe wealthy whites and adults I mean it's successful\nSo you know and I and conquer Joan and and and you know this is what Lyndon Johnson pointed out when he said the Republican strategy is essentially if you can convince the poorest white person but he's better than the richest black person he'll let you pick his pocket\nAnd and you know that is where they you know that has been the Republican strategy LBJ called it out sixty seven and it's been going on ever since\nAnd I was I was going on long before that and and you're on your point about the thin veneer of civilization I think is a really important one it's like the thin layer of the American middle class and these things are there by virtue of a whole lot of people creating structures that put them in place and hold them in place\nAnd the Republicans are systematically destroying those structures and it's like they're taking the murder beams out of the building\nAnd eventually it's just going to be the shell and it's going to collapse in on itself\nAnd you know whether you call a civilization or democracy or or you know the America or whatever and then that's one of the things that concerns me so much John thank you then you really an analysis thank you so much John Edwards in Wisconsin hey John what's on your mind\nLike Tom uh my idea is I've been going door to door prior to this round here and Randy Bryce don't do it's a it's the whole thing of um fascism I usually call it corporate system\nBecause see we've got a lot of union people around here and we understand that the corporation they don't want to hear from the people the one thing I hate the worst is they have the people tell them how to run their business right and it almost seems like now Trump is using or the Republicans are using the exact\nSame sample like that all of a unit ... and they want they don't want the people to have a voice yeah I\nGot it right up front about it right up front about it\nAnd then again you know big corporations that are right up front about it too I mean even you know Amazon now is is a you know having their their managers and they took over a whole foods they're they're having their managers that down and watch these videos about how evil unions are and how they screw things up there is such\nA basic idea right out front and you know it's alive because everybody else worked in the union around here and the other one point I wanted to bring up too as we used to have a ...\nAnd we used to make military shoes you know we had lent that's been out here as a representative and what are you still get a lot of pork barrel it just seems like more than\nJust shipped all overseas yeah\nWell that was you know the my American actors passing the Nineteen thirties the some of the federal government has the source products from American American manufacturers but there's a provision there for a waiver from the president and Reagan started passing out these waivers like they were candy to federal agency so that they could buy things from overseas\nAnd now it's just absolutely routine every president has done it ever since John thanks for the call\nYour listening I'm\n... and I've got the perfect formula to

disappearance and suspected murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey\nSo a joy and time I've been great question and I don't know if I have a the singular answer because as you said joy this is uncharted territory\nUm what I Do know is uh we're still waiting for their mother report we don't know if the mother report will be as strong as to say something so explicitly um it may say lots of other things that they're looking at and they've come up with\nAnd you know we still have all options on the table and how to deal with things I think ...\nIs one of the more difficult um so I think you know what we're going to have to do is one remember elections have consequences in less than three weeks a is a very very important election where we can flip the house of representatives maybe flip the Senate or maybe flip ten governorships in a whole bunch of state legislatures\nAs well as attorney generals and others across the country so we've got to be active around that if we take the majority in the house or we will be able to do hearings on his taxes on the Molly ... paws on all sorts of things and finally get some answers\nWere Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have been very quite happy bearing their head in the sand and not knowing what Donald Trump was actually up to so\nThere are lots of things were going to be able to do should the election go well on November six but right now I think the focus has to be on let's make sure we all do everything we can to get out the vote for that election and then we've got twenty twenty coming up a bare minimum to make sure that we can take back the White House\nBut uh we all have to be really present inactive and will definitely do our jobs in Congress but we need everyone being president active for November sex\nJohn and polls bowl Washington if I'm saying that right here on the air with Congress would poke him\n[noise] hello I'm I just have sort of a a generic question on when I'm In the dams are going to start a fighting fire with fire they they seem to\nTo play this touchy feely game and the every time they do or the Republicans thumbed their nose as they're doing an end run around the Democratic a strategy I'm\nTrying to wake up I guess is what I'm wanting to say ah I'll get back to you thank you\nYeah Johns that you know I think this has been a popular refrain that quite honestly has been overplayed because in the past I Would say I've seen this all too often where I Wish Democrats would be far more aggressive but right now we're watching us an generic ballot up double digits\nWere doing something right or maybe it's that they're doing something so wrong the public wants to change but you know I've actually for the first time since I've been in Congress have been happy with the message that we're going out talking about we're talking about health care and the cost of prescription drugs are talking about good paying jobs and the need for infrastructure\nAnd we're talking about the culture of corruption in Washington it's understandable people can relate to it\nAnd we have a message and I don't think we're being too soft a in how we do it\nNow I'll admit a Speaker Ryan for example his super PAC is probably the sleazy is pack I've ever seen out there and how they run ads\nBut they're not also being effective in many of these districts so you know they're going to do that if they're fine with rolling around in the mud\nAnd they can but they're not being effective and we're up double digits again on generic ballots and we're up and many of these races so I think talking about health care talking about those tax cuts they did talking about the corruption in Washington and no one in Congress is standing up to the president really is resonating so you know I don't know if we need to say it\nPounding our a fist on the table or seeing it in a soft confident voice but either way we're saying it and I think that's quite an improvement for maybe some past\nCycle so well I certainly agree your complaint John in the past has often been something I've also been concerned about right now I actually feel that we're doing some very right things going into November sex\nAllen Missoula, Montana you're on the air with congressman Pompeo\nYeah good morning gentleman um it's not something you'd like to hear me you know where I'm I'm retired Vietnam that I'm a\nI'm a previously we didn't have to pay for a under try or we didn't have to pay for our pharmaceuticals and a a sense a Trump is come into office they stole about away from us now and what are we even have to\nPay copayments now for our ah prescriptions and stuff and that's just another way that the Republicans keep stealing and we paid some pretty hard news for those benefits and that's something that should be brought out in public they are doing things that media and nobody else was even\nA layer of they're they're stealing our benefits left and right\nYeah I was ... it was a Senate bill and I can't remember the numbers on it took me three days on the phone to try and track at all now because I started getting this bill all of a sudden\nAnd so they are constantly what you're you guys are both they're constantly see when a benefit so we paid highly for\n... let me address it in two ways one um you're right uh we put a lot of money into defense\nUm most of it going to private contractors that also happen to help out mightily and campaigns\nAnd not enough into the people who actually have fought for the country and defended this country and you know here's a good example you're giving of of what's happening but you know second it it really opens it up to a bigger broader issue the Republicans in Congress are simply unwilling and uh\nGreat to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and you know this is one of the major things that we're talking about the Democrats across the country um yeah I think one of the most interesting statistics are was between two thousand six I'm Sorry tree doesn't tend to thousands sixteen the last time we ... we we did this um statistic\nUh there was something like two hundred and five or two hundred and ten drugs approved by the FDA\nEvery single one of them are had research provide help assistance provided by at age might national it's to ... which is our tax dollars so every time we hear from these pharmaceutical companies that are drugs are so expensive\nAnd it's in going faster than the cost of other medical expenses is because of research and development [noise] it's a complete lie and uh you

the Tom Hartmann group eight hundred eight five six eleven fifty\nFive [noise]\nSmartphone can is with us once Mendez with mark she's taking your calls for the hour Sarah in Tarzan of California you're on the air with congressman poke you\nBoth good I'm Glad I got on 'em that this morning I was listening to your predecessor here in LA Stephanie Miller and the one in conversations with all the people who have been saying when I've been saying for months we will eat ... none of them said you guys get Congress back\nWe need to put some ironclad laws and that would say quite plainly that uh you have to be as clear and transparent and the LA skyline after a Santa Anna's clear the air and that's that that\nI don't want Trump to be able to obfuscate and I mean I've known who led she's Nineteen sixty eight when you need a really difficult for ah LA unified to build a badly needed to school on the Ambassador Hotel site so I'm\nI've known Asian no good for for effort that I Would like to see some measure saying okay you want to run for president or governor or senator or congressman or you know any other you want to be out in the I'm a cabinet\nOr you had better be able to reduce your tax return your college transcripts or there should be a civil service exam for um\nAnybody who runs for a that China high office I Want to make sure we never get a jerk like Trump anywhere near the White House and not even this this year and I'd like to know what a\nBig Democrats just show me in a nice steak house back in ... not the Senate what you guys can do to make sure that something like this happens and protect our votes yeah\nQuestion Sarah and you know um I I think one of the things I mentioned John Sarbanes from Maryland is leading a taskforce on one of the vice chairs along with a lot of other folks actually are trying to address that it's such a good government task worth stressing everything from elections reform to campaign finance reform to ethics reform and we want that to be\nUm HR one that means the very first bill that Democrats introduced in the house representatives\nWould be a bill to address all of that uh we want to start the hearings on a tax returns and on the monuments clause to get to the bottom of a all the corruption really that's happening\nWith this current administration so there's a lot that we can do and we are very committed to it because I'm you know I think for many of us we thought that while humans clause was pretty self explanatory took this president to make it a somehow confused and now we've got to get there and clear that up on the taxes to every president's always released him\nThis is the first one not to I guess we have to clear it up but Democrats are committed to do that and again many of us are advocating this to be the very first bill introduced in Congress next session\nCharlotte in Ramona, California you're on the air with Congress and poke in\nHigh a permanent congressman I'm calling to ask you a question about um what is that I Am mostly on the progressive side but I'd confused what is the position that the progressive take on the issue of immigration\nSuch as what to do with the children that are coming up on a company from the south what to do about the middle east refugees\nWhat is your policy the if the progressive could get what they want I'd like to know what that would be\nSure I'm so Charlotte I think what we've been advocating for\nUm is really what work was kind of done two sessions ago and well it wasn't perfect it was a about a hundred percent virus where we're at right now\nUh which was comprehensive immigration reform that means there's going to be some extra protections at the borders but there's also going to be a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans we have to recognize we already have\nUm probably about Thirteen million people here\nWho are here undocumented uh it's not realistic to think that someone who came here when they were two weeks old or two years old is going to be deported at age twenty or forty um to a country they may not speak the language and uh and they may not know anyone there\nSo we have to have something in place and it's not an automatic ah there's a process to do that\nA bill went through the Senate with a I think about Seventy votes um two sessions ago and didn't get taken up by the Republican leadership in the house representatives\nUh it was a bipartisan compromise didn't go as far as I Would like to go on in some areas but realistically\nThat is the approach we have to do right now family separation um DACA I mean all these are separate fights we're having that we shouldn't we should have a comprehensive immigration reform and I think that's the path that we would try to bring forward again should we be in the majority\nBill in Sun City Arizona you're on the air with Congress and poke in\nThe congressman good morning ended up to find him or his real quick question for the first is right you have these corporate still owns a suspension as it was George W. Bush and how do you like working with are Christians and I'll listen online thank you\nYeah so I mean there's a lot of attacks period right now with this president more so than even in the past but I think you know basically um we we have protection a in this country our problem is when the White House is doing some of the things they're doing that\nIn Mali ... clause actions are not showing tax returns things that we always took his norms\nAre we have to fix some of that so um\nIf we take the majority in the house that's one thing but do we have the majority in the Senate is another thing we

park Michigan you're on the air with congressman poke him\nHey Tommy afternoon hello congressman Pokemon\nUm I'm calling because I Am currently in a Twitter war with someone who he was referring to as far as Mitch McConnell coming out yesterday and using the debt as a way to cut Social Security and Medicare they're in such a Bible that\nYou cannot get down to even discuss it worse fake news you're lying ... doesn't lie I'm what you point out the facts to them they don't want to even consider another viewpoint\nSo how are you going to get through to the seniors who consistently will ignore all the attacks on Social Security they're not lying about it anymore and they're open about it and\nIt's sort of like how do you need program people out of the cult of Fox News thinking more [noise]\nYes oh sorry about that my phone just went off I'm Sorry what was talking here I'm so Laurie you bring up a great point and I think you know there are some that were not going to change right I mean the thirty five percent that are sticking with\nThe Trump hard and fast or there for maybe some other reasons and they actually admit\nBut I Do think most seniors especially you know I've watched in the last five years first remove my mom to some senior housing now to assisted living I look at the people who are living there you get to know the neighbors and there's so many people that rely on Social Security without it or they wouldn't be able to uh to live and I think you can actually\nPoint out the fact that the Republican leadership has set this thing each time after they pass the tax cut bill that's going to benefit big corporations and the top one percent eighty three percent of the money that was in that tax bill goes to the top one percent in ten years\nAnd then they're going after your Social Security to pay for it and your Medicare and I think we can get two people on their pocketbook issues especially seniors who just rely for their life and death on whether or not they have that money I think we can really have a conversation with those who don't have a different reason for wind vote for Trump and and\nYou know in some cases there's things like racism and others that are just tougher to break through\nRobin Phoenix, Arizona you're on the air with Congress and poke at\nYeah it's a pleasure to talk to you hey I'm wanted to talk about the D D triple C strategy here and I think what what's happening with our our party as we get kind of into the weeds on stuff it only affects the very few people\nAnd I think one thing that we should do is basically promote the idea that the Republicans are the ... by a thousand cuts on the middle class and we need to fight this like tax reform and we just use their philosophy since corporations are people there should only be one tax code income is income which should get rid of the uh you know Fifteen Percent cap\nOn a dividends and just treat all the from the same because corporations are people so therefore people are corporations we should get the same to ... or you should take the direction of the way from the corporations and move that way or the one thing about the taxes of Social Security does that's kept on you know I had a hundred and thirty two thousand Kay of income\nThat's a hundred percent six point three you want to give most of America a five percent a rave right away to cap off and make again Texas Social Security and all the income all the way up and don't care for that one thirty two people to get a five percent or a tax cut right there [noise]\nYeah right ... to the first issue um I agree there are many of us who in many I mean are quite a bit in the Democratic party who've advocate for changing that code on the passive income so called passive income\nVersus active income uh there shouldn't be that distinction and I think that's something that we're going to be talking about 'em to the second point I agree I mean it's really a regressive tax when you have a cap\nOn Social Security a certain point and we're talking about how long does the fun to have\nThe only difference I might say Rob is I don't think it's really going to be a cut for people I think if you lifted the cap or adjusted the cap for inflation significantly um you'll just extend the life of Social Security so that we don't have to have an increase I don't think you see an immediate cut\nBut that's actually the reason to do it we have to have Social Security around because everyone is paid into it they have to be able to get it when they retire\nAnd the best way to do that is to really look at that cap\nAnd it just seems kind of bizarre that you know uh uh I and most of the people I Know are paying\nA you know a a Social Security taxes on all of our income and you know billionaires are paying Social Security taxes on you know one percent of their income is like they're really they're not paying their their their fair share for to support Social Security which is a program that keeps this country vital\nYep and and there's a lot of um ideas of how we could exactly do this but I look at the cap is is one of the single easiest ways and that would also argue we should change the\nIndex for how we increase what people getting Social Security to a CPI dash eat witches are based on what senior spend their money on for twenty five percent of their income is on medicine and medical care\nUm we should recognize that and that way they would get a little bit more of a boost as well\nCongressman we have forty five seconds till the end of the hour what are your thoughts on the coming week\nYou know I'll tell you were a now less than three weeks to the election I think my thoughts for the next three weeks are going to be on the election as our I think most people um I just really ask people to be active with the candidates you support and the groups that are supporting the candy to support in the next three weeks it is so vital\nEvery but we get out of the majority of people agree with us on the issues if they get out the vote we will be very very successful and be able to turn\nThis country and many of our states around so please take that that age that you have right now for what's going on turn into activism we can build this into a movement not just have a moment um I I think that's the key for the next few weeks\nAnd share our values as we talk about our issues\nI tell you one of the big things we're doing now is we actually we do door just supposed to talk to people they really do agree it doesn't\nOut or something oh Kim thanks so much for being
