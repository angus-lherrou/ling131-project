guess it was a Tuesday of this week the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Boeing seven forty seven\nThat trade or September thirtieth was the fiftieth anniversary of the rollout of the seven forty seven which to this day if you ask me and and many other people is uh the most important the most influential jetliner in in history a introduced\nI didn't know introduced economies\nOf scale and then and that allowed for the first time large numbers of people to travel long distances ad affordable fares more than any other playing it changed the entire face or ...\nI didn't know that it was the first uh you know airplane with ... says I knew of course it was a double decker with that ... front knows but I didn't know it was the first ...\nIt was it was the first a wide bodied jets and and watch absolutely remarkable it it went from a literal drawing on the back of a napkin to an actual flying airplane and just a little bit over two years now than when I more than it was more than double the size of a existing\nPlay and and and do that from scratch and just a little over twenty four months to Eddie and nowadays it takes five years just to design the variants of an existing play and I mean that was just incredible considering it at the the era and what it what had happened the Nineteen sixties the late sixties\nAnd considering what I Know from having read your column and this this week it was twice the size of any existing passenger plane at the time which is extraordinary to be able to build it in two years to\nChile and and it's it's a beautiful place and it was and it is a beautiful place I mean it's so much more elegant and then to a three eighty which is the plan that superseded it finally in in terms of size it's a\nYou know I call it the Empire State building of airplanes is not the biggest anymore it's not flashy is but it's still the most elegant and and the class he is\nAll right I Know another thing that's been on your mind is the overcrowding of airport lounges we're talking about the ones where you have to be a member or have a credit card that allows you in a particular lines lounge and I've got to say I agree with you I mean the airport lounges don't seem necessarily quiet highways anymore or they\nYeah and I don't understand why more travelers are and are\nConcerned about this why is it more of a point of controversy here maybe it is and I just haven't picked up on it but you know maybe I sounds duty but I always thought of the the first or the business class lounge as a place of some exclusivity of of luxury or even even extravagance to some level and yet\nYou go into the loud just today and they're kind of a cross between a cafeteria at a daycare center\nThey're nervous about it and in part because it's so easy to get in if you have\nThis credit card and then this level you can command and you can bring in some cases unlimited guests I mean it it's crazy the ... and some lounges I've actually seen people standing at eating food out of place while they're standing a quarter because there are no seat\nAnd on top of that you've got an issue with children being brought any laws and are very unruly baby's screaming kids running I was in it allows you to Amsterdam racially and they were kids running barefoot throwing themselves over the furniture I mean this is supposed to be the premium clash ... the executive lounge we used to call it right\nYeah have you heard anything in in in in hanging around airports as you do and being in the airline business whether airline companies are concerned about this I Know they're trying to you know up the food offerings and so on but are they talking about building bigger wins\nOr what can be done I mean short of building all new and and much bigger lounges which in a lot of cases is a non starter I mean really the only way to deal with it is to restrict the passengers who can enter may be a\nYou know how to dive lounge it'd be only for first in this class passengers period or if you're going to let people in through third party perks or you know max and what a [noise]\nUm let that be the case only when I was at a certain capacity or less maybe limit the number of gas that people can bring it but it's it's kind of out of control at this point and something has to be\nIn the last Fifteen seconds we have left you onto the anger parents

and he's joining us now from Atlanta\nWell Gary well with a title that clearly you're exactly the person we want to talk to on the topic of travel and potential room was how're you doing\nVery well well I Hope I and I ended up to the thank you very much\nWe appreciate it that's all right so last month there was at least one flight where some passengers complained of sore throats and other flu like symptoms and the CDC was asked to investigate so I'm going to start off with traveling in the flu since October is the official start of the flu season water some top ten you recommend for travel during this time of year\nWell that's a good subject to talk with because you're really getting into the season now and I think it's really important that people up to date with with a few short I think it's the most important thing that you can do to prevent um for the first line of defense\nAnd so we would encourage anyone uh to to get a vaccination\nOkay Gary either question I picked up a friend from Newark airport in New Jersey just a few days ago was this week and while I was waiting for her I thought that real travelers coming off a slight with those papers face masks and I'm curious I Know there was a potential measles warning issued actually at Newark a few weeks ago\nI travelers are concerned about avoiding airborne germs do those papers face masks actually help\nWell it's actually ... within the effective or not I think some people just feel more reassured using them right um although people are concerned about getting illnesses are catching a bug on it on an airplane it's\nA relatively harmless environment although it is possible ... um what people were killed people is if they are ill they shouldn't be traveling we we advise people not only for their own sake but for a lot of travelling\nTo avoid travel if they are\nThey are now and they have to travel maybe they should be wearing face masks please please people I'm All right so yeah so I think a lot of confusion about the guy it's almost like sometimes when it's really and the media that everyone thinks it's all over the place and now it's really not an immediate but\nYou know it's still around right so can you give us the latest update on the ... is it active anywhere\nSo early on in the last year we had a lot of reports in the media about the 'cause she would oppose it was introduced to the west and and but we haven't been hearing as much about it recently but you make an important point because\nHe could do very much present it is still present in a lot of the destinations that people traveled to for the holidays\nAnd people need to be aware of the risks associated with a simple the average person it's not really a concern but as we know there are complications and and help through associated with pregnant women getting this disease\nRight or good information or certainly and so I'm going to ask you this five months ago our oldest son traveled the gun or with a college friend and we knew certain vaccines would be required but we didn't know what was the timeframe for getting them and there was one in particular have and I can think of for yellow fever they had to get before he could actually get a visa\nSo can you address the importance of meeting with a travel medical advisor and how far in advance do you recommend personally during this before in trouble\nYou know I think it's an essential to take before traveling overseas and really to any of the nation\nWe are seeing a provider about four to six weeks ahead of time\nAnd that's important because some of the nation need more than one short and so you want to be sure that you have time to get all the vaccinations that you might um one point to remember with vaccines that this is a good opportunity to make sure\nYou up today with your teen vaccines those are your routine childhood vaccines\nAnd then we add to that the vaccine\nAnd then as you mentioned the destination a specific vaccines that might be required and certainly in Africa yellow fever is is one of those yeah that was provided a well ahead of time you should be able to set up with all the vaccinations\nFlora Gary

Wayne is absolutely right that she was\nUm a really great builder in the outer boroughs um but much of his building was actually made possible\nThrough federal housing subsidies he was actually one of the country's biggest recipients of cheap building loans basically made possible by the federal government and he used I'm twenty six million dollars or so\nOf those cheap loans to build two of his biggest um apartment complexes in New York I'm a place called betray you than another place called shore haven both out in Brooklyn\nUm these are massive massive apartment complexes thousands and thousands of units and and so he's building those in the late forties and what he did was something quite clever he she he um he put the land underneath the buildings\nInto a trust and made his children the beneficiaries of that trust and then he had the company's his companies that were actually building the buildings on top of the land\nSigned Ninety nine year leases to pay rent to the landlords his young children\nAnd so what that meant was that Donald Trump starting at age three\nWas for Trump's landlord he was collecting rent payments um from Fred Trump's companies and it was um this kind of maneuver right setting up the sort of mechanisms these financial mechanisms that were just\nKind of create this automatic streams of money that we're just sort of month by month by month with trickled into trust accounts or into partnerships\nIn finding their way ultimately into the the pockets of his children for Trump was just a genius at\nComing up with new ways new revenue streams to funnel into the pockets of his children so he didn't just make his children um his landlord she also made his children his banker humid Donald Trump not just didn't just put them on the salary is vice president for Trump's\nCompanies he also then paid him separately to be as consultant\nWho pays him separately to be a property manager he played them pay them separately to be a purchasing agent and on and on and all at once and then the\nCourse of all all of us as we gather up all of this the the records from inside of his uh for Trump's real estate empire we started counting up how many how many different revenue stream says he created for Donald Trump through the years\nAnd we got up to two hundred and Ninety five what we found that what we were able to document\nSome of these things you know they weren't in and of themselves big money like for example for Trump funnel the laundry revenue from his buildings to um to to Donald for so a lot of money but when you sort of start aggregating it putting it all together\nIt's this just this mighty endless river\nOf money flowing constantly in to the bank accounts of Donald Trump\nI mean one of the things that you do in your piece as you give a very strong sense of the extent to which Trump seemed to have a special relationship with Donald Trump can you explain that so much of the money uh accrue to Donald Trump against uh\nOther children so you know what did you learn about\nWhy that would be the case and also that the Pentagon illegality I mean what you spoke of beach haven and show I have and the response ability for that in a ... and is it actually technically illegal when he did\nSo in that transaction there's nothing illegal about that transaction that we've uncovered that's not what I'm that's not the point that I'm trying to make their that's an example though of one of the many different ways that Fred Trump was enriching Donald Trump starting from a very early age and continuing on a forward\nUm your your your um I'm Sorry the other point\nAbout the relationship between fat on al ... why did he get some money\nSo he said Trump had 'em in a an older son\nFor Trump junior who um initially it was kind of going to be the heir apparent right in ... I was interested in you know she she she really wanted to pass this dynasty on to um to uh to one of his children\nAnd Fred junior was sort of the first\nKind of natural Arab ... as the oldest son but he didn't have the passion for the business\nUm he had other interests he liked to fly airplanes he loved music he he he ... the father considered Fred Trump the son\nTo be a little too soft\nI'm a little too nice um and before long um it became clear that she was not going to be the Arab parent\nThe heir apparent was going to be Donald Trump and Donald Trump was very aware of his father's disapproval of Fred junior he witnesses spread could senior\nCould be quite cruel and I think what we see in terms of this is really from the interviews with people who work closely with Fred Trump you could they witnessed\nThis young man Donald Trump\nSort of watching what had happened to Fred junior and almost forming himself into for juniors opposite\nFred junior was soft too nice will Donald was going to be a shark he was going to be a killer\nSo that that I think is sort of at the core of this father son relationship which is very much with this story is about it is about a father son relationship these two men were extraordinarily close Donald Trump said we we quote him that he felt that he knew\nHis father better than anybody else in the world I'm In and they they they talk daily they spent\nYou know many a weekend together they were in constant communication Donald Trump was a constant\nPresence when Fred Trump would have strategy sessions with his his top lawyers as top accountants I'm figuring out what his next moves were\nA Fred Trump was often this sort of silent lurking presents at Donald Trump's big flashy press conferences and so they were this there was a it was more than just a father son relationship it was also a partnership\nAnd it's interesting you talked about the amount of federal grants that he got that Frank Trump got an interesting not just say Donald Trump came into the business and they were too because they're getting federal support and they're discriminating against African Americans\nScience times by Roberta flak democracy now I'm In a good thing with their means shape our yesterday our three times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist David in Barstow didn't Nason exposition and the New York times this week that's going to be re issued on Sunday\nThe New York state taxation is already responded to the times report on Donald Trump's tax practices with the statement that it's called vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues investigation\nMeanwhile New York Mayor Bill de Blasio treated I've directed NYC is department of finance to immediately investigate taxing housing violation to work with on why state to find out if appropriate taxes were paid the mayor told reporters she is looking to recoup any money Trump is New York city\nOh there was a good old boy network that obviously a Donald Trump or played like a shuttle and a evaded the kind of a regulation and investigation and prosecution he should have received many times over he you know [noise]\n... gold and paid his way to being a Somali able to escape the kind of scrutiny and prosecution he deserved\nAnd honestly if a lot of people in New York state had done their job she would never been part of the United states it's clear to me that uh there are a real ramifications right now to what has been disclosed that there's a\nEither a potential violations of the law or in the cases where the statute of limitations has a a ended that uh there may be very serious civil penalties that can be applied by both the state in the city\nThat's Mayor Bill de Blasio responding to your investigation what can New York recoup New York city New York state and are there are criminal charges at all here\nUm [noise] brownish returns which\nI think um I think that that clearly the sexual imitations is the big obstacle to any kind of a a criminal charges however um you know we actually don't know what\nEnded up in Donald Trump's tax returns and so if there are things that she misreported\nUm that have their roots in some of the transactions that were describing in this article and those miss representations carry forward into future tax returns um from from Donald Trump that could be potentially problematic because that could maybe\nI'm a type of sexual imitations off the table as an obstacle\nI'm there could be a criminal\nOr a prosecution potentially although like what's you know let's be real here I mean the IRS is a much weekend is in the I mean it's been quite devastated\nBy um budget cuts over over the years um and um and certainly the the IRS I'm Talking about a buck talking about state authorities now talking about the federal Ira has said absolutely nothing in response to this article um I think the more the more I'm\nA little more realistic uh accountability that's there is this potential for civil um fraud\nUm there's no statute of limitations for civil tax fraud um and so both this you know this because the state tax authorities that can be a very powerful weapon on if they decide to actually use it um to go back and look at these um uh transactions\nLet's go to um some of the mechanism that you point to a ... in the seats\nThat Trump a and used in order to avoid paying taxes explain what Gratz died G. R. A. I. G. S.\nS. and how they were and how they will use ... video accompany the New York times that the day you are co authors who than crack explains how Trump and his siblings came to own nearly all of their father a fact Trump empire\nWithout paying at state taxes graft\nTrust designed past wealth between generations\nIn Nineteen Ninety five Donald Trump and his siblings began to take ownership of most of their father's real estate empire while avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes [noise] they did so by creating to grad short retained annuity trust also known as ... one for died in one from um [noise]\nTaxes are paid based on the final value of the grass and escaped the Trump every incentive to low ball the value of the stuff that's exactly what they did\nTake for instance the phone totally apartments in Nineteen eighty to the Trump value the hundred and sixty four unit complex at Fifteen point three million dollars but for the purposes of the ... they said it was worth of just two point nine million dollars\nThen broke up the ownership of the apartments giving almost half married Trump Fred Trump's wife [noise]\nDisallowed dumped you tell the IRS Fred Trump who would exercise iron fist control over every breakfast empire for Seventy years was a minority owner with no real say over his buildings\nSo David that you are co authors Suzanne cranked taunting about ground could you comment on whether this instrument is what essentially gave legal cover on to a Trump the transaction\nYou know I mean it's sort of Gratz are um you know a well established and Leo instrument that's used by the wealthy\n'em to pass um assets onto their children in a way that allows them to avoid a state taxes in fact\nUm if you watch TV often see these commercials from video um that are actually ... commercials they don't say the word grab\nBut when you see this what is the idea the video is this tax consider this consulting firm I'm I'm that is that is actually on CNBC MSNBC and CNN is running commercials that are effectively commercials for grabs\nI'm a I'm and I'm and so it's a it's a it's a um it's a technique that when you talk to tax lawyers\nYou know the kind of they they have this they almost got a little misty eyed about Gratz they said this is like magic these things are these incredible devices that\nAssets go in all kinds of financial gymnastics occur inside of them and then they sort of assets come out and they're like free of taxes\nI wanted to go to another of your former colleagues and that is David Cay Johnston also fellow Pulitzer Prize winner and\nNow editor in chief at D.C report tight arcane noted on MSNBC that Trump sister who is a federal judge has heavily implicated in these charges of tax fraud\nMuch keeping my sister now I Am Trump Barry is a shooting judge on the third circuit court of appeals she's a senior judge I treated today though I think she should immediately remove herself from the bench we should not have a tax cheat in the White House or on the federal bench [noise]\nWhat do you think of that sets David Cay Johnston\nSo I'm a I think the important thing to to say about this is that\nFor Trump's estate tax return it was a very important document\nUm and there were three executor as there were three people who signed off on that the state tax return one was judge Barry one was President Trump and the third was Robert Trump the president's younger brother\nWhen you sign an estate tax return\nYou're responsible for the accuracy of that tax return you're responsible for accurately describing the assets and you're also responsible for describing all of the gifts that were given by the person the person in the state\nSo what we describe in our story is that the estate tax return that the three of them side but the three of them vote for that tax return is grossly inaccurate news all of the same kind of techniques that we describe in other parts of the story\nAnd it did so in order to make what was left of for Trump's empire look like\nMiniscule um and so I think that actually that the fact that she put her John Hancock on that I'm a state tax return um I think that's an area that is is potentially problematic\nWhat most surprised you and what you found David as we begin [laughter]\nThe thing\nThat I think continues to surprise me about Donald Trump is if this is this guy who has been so much in the ... of our culture and our media for so long and yet\nThere's so little that we actually know about him and his finances\nYou know ... there's this mountain right mountain of books and and interviews and you know it's just it's it's daunting 'em to look at but when you kind of put all of that side aside and just trying to get to ground troops would this guy it's\nIt's every time we have done that we've been we feel like oh my gosh the idea of whatever the idea was that we saw was um about him is it's quite different when you pull some more layers back\n\n[noise] cabin on the court new tropical storm I'm and Kate's knew U.S Supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh tackled his first cases tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine tell CBS his face the nation why she voted in favor of Kavanaugh after he was accused of sexual assault\nThese may well be signs that are being made in the MDC by some sign maker who knows but so what\nBut the the thing that's really interesting is that\nTrump goes ... anti Semitic\nBen Shapiro over on Fox News he says I wasn't aware that Brett Kavanaugh forfeited his presumption of innocence are due process of law simply because of the color of his skin\nWhat does this have to do with race\nThere's two black people on the Senate Judiciary committee\nHarris and Cory Booker is that what this is all about\nApparently over at Fox News it is\nA this is a man of our code or mark ... writing in salon today\nIf you flip on Fox News these days you'd think the battle is largely about race in that the white men are being subject to false rape allegations to perpetuate some sort of anti white hope pressure\nTucker Carlson said on Fox you might wonder what the world this story the Kavanaugh story has to do with race\nAnd any answers as aren't questioning says it's about punishing everyone who looks like Brett Kavanaugh\nIn other words let's get the white guys\nApparently you know an effort being led by Dianne Feinstein I you know a white person but you know go figure Martha my column on Fox News\nWondered if Kavanaugh I should say I'm not guilty because I'm just just because I'm a white guy\nYou know Ben Shapiro the court I just gave you an all this seems to have followed on on Ann Coulter she apparently was the one who started all this she said white privilege means that any white male can be accused with evidence free accusations like this\nBut Tucker Carlson a particular amount of our code rights is embracing the opportunities cabin on skin color to convince white middle class working class Americans to align themselves with is actually the Koch brothers or the money to lead the the the billionaire class against people of color\nEven though these working class white people share the same economic concerns with the people of color\nCarlson was even shameless enough she writes to characterize a crowd the boon Senator Lindsey Graham for his events of Donald Trump is waging a revolution against the working class in quotes\nSo Donald Trump the billionaire who are inherited four hundred Thirteen or or scammed four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his dad\nIs a the representative of the working class in America and the actual working class people who are out there protesting now not so much\nAny others there's a lot of other stuff and the news well actually let me just share this with the real quickly I mentioned yesterday\nThe Indiana feed a sidewalk Indiana is one of two states where these bizarre was loose it's been on hold for a couple of years by a federal judge or so it's not it's not in place right now but before the federal judge put it on hold\nA most people are probably forgotten the story this is from uh the spring of twenty Fifteen\nOf ... Patel\nNow in twenty Thirteen January twenty Thirteen Jared fourteenth twenty Thirteen and fact Mike Pence was sworn in as governor of Indiana\nIn late July of that same near Perfect Paul tell this from a ... pound it writing or a salon\nIn late July that same year ... Patel\nWent to the hospital and then paying this was a ... I I'm pretty sure there's a woman of Indian ancestry\nBleeding heavily after a miscarriage the doctor who saw her suspected street induced an abortion and called the police\nWhen Patel woke up after ... there was a police officer standing by her bed\nAnd the anti choice Dr I left the hospital to go in search of the fetus and sure enough they found one\nAnd despite hospital test showing no traces of any aboard a face yet in her blood work\nThe state of Indiana charged her with both feet aside for allegedly inducing an abortion and child and the clock for allegedly having a premature baby\nSo that was that was in you know\nThis originally happened the same year that\nAnd then the next year that was twenty Thirteen\nTwenty fourteen she's arrested\nIn March of this year than this from this piece in salon a pen signed a law prohibiting women from a tiny obtaining abortion because of race\nOr the gender of disability the fetus make in India the second they said the nation and do this this has scared the hell\nPeople of color because\n... you can you can now say to a woman who who is not Caucasian that ah who had a miscarriage that she had actually tried to induce that because she had a child who was a person of color she was trying to induce abortion based on race\nAnd she basically has no defense I mean this is this is what happened to ... Patel\nIn fact a perfect Patel had had numerous text messages where the front of her as a ... is talking about how she was afraid to go to the doctor because you know she didn't know what happened [noise] um\nSo you know a federal judge block this in this law but um this this ... but you know what happened then on march thirtieth\nWas thirty three year old ... hotel was sentenced to Twenty years in prison\nShe'd been facing a third of Seventy or a sentence under Mike Pence's laws and Mike Pence's Indiana Seventy or sons they sat and started Twenty years in prison\nShe originally she was sentenced to actually to Thirty years ten years was suspended\nAnd then they had also a six year sentence on the feed is a charge that overlaps that now since then she has she has gotten out that I Believe this or something so it's been a reverse in fact\nOr at least is on hold\nBut I mean this is this is the world\nThe Brett Kavanaugh would have us live in this is the world that Mike Pence and now Donald Trump would have us live in\nDonald Trump we laughed with so Howard Stern about how when his second wife when while when his second wife was his girlfriend and he got her pregnant a Marla Maples he discussed with her whether or not she should have an abortion and she decided she wanted to have the baby and those Tiffany\nSo you know ... that\nThat is like right up at the top of the list of the stakes in this debate although everybody's frame ended about whether\nClinton Christine Blasey Ford should be believed and obviously you know should be and and whether the FBI shouldn't be doing an investigation into that and yes they should have gifts the White House block them\nAnd ... tells me that this is not just you know some you know created all crazy judge or crazy or the food now Russia will paddle this is this is a demonstration of the instant the machinery and the institutional machinery\nTo move back to the males are actually two\nOkay and the fact that no matter if you never had a pretty darn it on the client like he did the times when they were just trying to beat them and protect the sale Mm okay so that's the extent to which that's what I'm saying why supplements the ground but why people better the\nKind of at the time is bad is this just dont yeah and people are ... ...

the Kennedy the\nActress a activist writer board chair of progressive Democrats of America PT America dot org star the hit series mom on CBS speedy American at our website many Kennedy LA as our Twitter handle many walking back in the program\nTom I'm so glad to be back on the program with yeah Hi\nHi it's great to have you with us so uh you know the last time you were on we were talking about ballot images that some of these electronic voting machines actually capture an image of the vote which could be used for an audit just like a paper trail\nAnd apparently one of the groups that is promoting this uh uh is being sued are in the u._s._a. or has been traveling with a lawsuit from one of the voting machine companies what's going on they've\nGot what's called the threat ladder seems to be a deliberate just a bullying society about what they threatened is not to take\nAnd I say to court if they don't take off their website the manual that shows election officials how these\nBallot images can be saved it's just a choice on the menu many election officials John breaking found as he went across the United states trying to get people to save their ballot images\nThey didn't know it existed they're like well we didn't read the manual and we don't know a lot of county election officials that had not been digitally trains or technically trained so this was part of a citizen education here's the manual here's what we're talking about any yes in Athens going no it's our copyright\nBut you can't do anything it's not that cold you can't do anything with Emanuel unless you have the machine right there only the election of them the machine and he has said that isn't telling their\nTheir counties that these ballot images exist so it seems like a threat oh my God you're trying to make us trans parent you can't use citizens shut up go away no\nWe're going to count the vote and his style instead to count the votes so I guess the F ... inside\nYeah so we have we have two two issues here one is the millions of people are who are being ill legitimately incorrectly inaccurately or perhaps accurate because they were targeted because they were young old or or a or a minority racial minority\nUh who are being thrown off of voting rolls all across the United states in an effort that has been championed by Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and then at the same time we've got ... ... even if you're going to end up voting if they if you ... if your name Adam and emerged from the voting laws you may well be voting machine that could be doing anything to your vote\nAnything to your vote and that's the trouble with on trans parent digital counting um and fracking counting as we know we've done forever and magic and talked about how some detectable but on the ballot images are a means of audit and interestingly Tom because the help America vote act\nHad some language about well it has to be audible in case you know ... challenge so ballot images were sort of included and talked about by the vendors as well we have a picture of every ballot we scam so you could look at photos and now they're hiding them\n... also I Want to caution people the Republicans are trying to go oh ballot images great now that you want those let's make those the only audit mechanism let's never go to paper ballots and that's not cool because you could duplicate messed with ballot images digitally and if you never connected them to their papers stores\nBy some sort of percentage less connect and seeing all these ballot images are really from their stores that would be a percentage audit for ... uh do you both you can't just do it by device\nVeteran legislator then went ... and then the ... and then the third issue is uh to you know how vulnerable are our election systems and this would include are voting registration rolls\nTo hacking and we know that I at least according to the FBI that the Russians have hacked into the into the voting systems and the uh the registration rolls of a you know ... states now and you have to enter and according to Trump the Chinese have done the same thing\nAnd yet there is some evidence that other countries as well have a Iran's specifically have penetrated and North Korea penetrated our voting systems um yeah so what's being done about all these things maybe get\nA well to federal legislation sales because really our elected officials are scared to tell election offices what to do our elected officials so\nHere's my solution or and what I'm trying to message we each of us voters we have to protect our own votes so here's what I'm telling people to do go to your secretary of state sector registration\nIn your registration check if you're not if it's not right if anything's wrong or if you're not there called the number is there or go down\nTo your office and makes you register don't depend on somebody canvassing you got to go down to the office and want to do it online soon because later they're going to go oh you weren't on the roads cause you registered to lately were backlog number two\nIf your registration shows that your vote by mail voter make sure that you get that vote by mail\nBallot and either voted and send it in early so it's been election night return because anything coming into near to the election I Will be processed and will be an election night returns you need to both about or\nYou prefer to go to the polls you've got to bring that ballot in and surrender it on voted or they won't give you a ballot because they'll assume you used it and you're voting twice\nDaniel vote provisional don't get in the provisional batch it's banned in every state right and you need to be in the regular ballot that she got a check your registration no your vote by mail status take care of me they're getting the damn ballot\nNo I don't know I didn't get it and I want to vote no they'll leave Tampa you're going to vote for visual you gotta make sure that you tell the office I haven't got my ballot and I want it\nYou also need to screen shot of your registration and maybe print it out and take it to the polls because they might tell you well you're not here and you can say yeah well I was here this is not my fault somebody has gotten into your voter all\nHas harnessing the power of nutrient rich beats and created a super food that helps your body make more

the math and science being waged by the left and my guess as to why they're doing it\nBecause we know that the right drink like crying climate scientists threaten the drug pipeline that dread being money and release them threaten the authoritarian control through religion but why dismiss and disparage they encounter vegetable physical evidence that\nThe new science fiction the new physiological

found in every group so is parasitic incorrect PCs predation humans who had actually and deliberately harm other people\nFor personal and private game now the crux of the argument to say racism is not caused by race it is caused by predators using race at a rationalize station for that protection\nAnd the ironic thing is race is not linked to any specific characteristic behavior but predatory behavior does have\nSpecific physiological and possibly genetic determinants another with creditors are in effect projecting their own biologically to kind of behavior onto his\nRace or gender does not determine and anti social behavior and my conclusion is\nDon't be afraid of physical truth if you are indeed a partner and protect and not a credit to the truth of the biological basis of behavior can only help you\nOK dirty you you make\nA compelling argument or I Believe um and probably one that deserves more than four minutes on the radio [laughter] and and so you know we'll have to circle back to it at some point in the future but thank you thank you for raising that I'm Mark in San Diego California a mark what's up\n[noise] ... ah you're wondering why we get in these situations where an officer candidate Kavanaugh's being shoved down our throw it against their will eat all our popular because I got brothers want him\nWell it's I think it's more a structural than that I think it's because the United states government\nIs the way it is not that the majority of the people that start with the U.S shut it sure or do you have to start from California represented almost forty million all yet not on it with ... million people get through senators\nOh yeah well the ordinary people get through senator that's why you have like ... or actually and Mitch McConnell\nAlways see that in a way against the war and all these guys keep getting reelected and they and they send you already got a Congress what you're supposed to be more representative yeah ... journey matters so much that it does not and then you've got an accent and the White House who lost three million votes\nSo that's another thing I discovered or that's why we get candidates and all the shop down our throats absolutely that much of the country a lot\nYeah and most of the things that you've described originate in the debate over slavery they they are parts of the compromise and there were a series of them the Connecticut Compromise is probably the most famous one um that\nThat basically wanted to keep out the in the textbooks you know for particularly the ones that you read in the northern schools it's it was always about Delaware Rhode Island the small states but in fact the population in Georgia was about the same as as one of those states I I forget which one at the time of the of the\nOf the writing of the constitution the white population in Georgia but the you know the black population Georgia was substantial and and so really the two senators per state\nAnd you know was was based on on giving the slave states extra power as well as the small states up north and that you know that needs to be stripped out of the constitution or we need to come to a better understanding of that number one\nAnd then number two the electoral college was you know there for the exact same reason to give the small states slave states you know a large say so you know yeah spot on mark thanks for the call
