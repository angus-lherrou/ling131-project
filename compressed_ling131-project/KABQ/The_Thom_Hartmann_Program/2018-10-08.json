progressive majority on the Supreme Court had not been for these two events\nBut in any case you know we got Trump we a cabin on what a what a shock\nBut are we losing\nCome on you just eat away at Trump's has mobilized millions of women\nYou know back in Ninety One when they did this to Clarence Thomas in in the election Ninety two women just mop the floor with men and the terrible terrible metaphor is not\nA ... you get my point uh you know they they ... I mean this is this is when a Dianne Dianne Feinstein got into the Senate and Patty Murray from Washington state they both got they both ran for the Senate as a result of how the hell was treated in the Clarence Thomas hearings\nAnd there are still there\nPlus Trump is being investigated by Mahler plus Trump is being investigated by New York state for five hundred million dollar tax fraud\nPlus there's an election coming in three and a half weeks I mean you know we'll see who's winning\nWe'll see I mean we can have this conversation after the election but right now I'm not willing to despair\nIn fact I Would say you know Charles Blow has a piece in the New York times today\nMaybe was yesterday yeah it was yesterday October seven a title liberals this war [noise]\nAnd when he's pointing out is that this is part of a conservative plan and by conservatives were talking about privileged white men\nAnd the women who are subservient to them\nThat this is a much larger power play\nBy these so called conservatives\nTo enshrine and protect white male power in the United states\nYou know in a way it reminds me of apartheid South Africa\nThe you know as the white man who ran apartheid South Africa gave up their power which was a pretty remarkable thing when you think about it\nThere was this period of transition well we're not going through that period of ... you know we sort of started that in the sixties and the civil rights movement all that but now you know they want to roll all that back and in fact the Supreme Court has already got in the voting rights act\nAnd this is why they talk about originalism\nRight originalism is just a way of saying you know these those founders who owned slaves\nAnd you know beat them and raped them a black people were not human didn't have the right to vote didn't have the right to work didn't have the right to frankly live women couldn't vote couldn't participate couldn't own property poor white men couldn't own couldn't vote\nIn many states\nThe founders were a bunch of rich powerful white men who didn't want\nTrue democracy writes Charles Blow and in fact he says they were dreadfully afraid of it and he's right\nIt's why we got the electoral college it's why it's why you know small states have two senators\nAnd now a bunch of rich powerful white men want to start\n... want to change the way our court systems work\nSo that we're looking at laws in the context of that you know through that frame for example I mean this is this is what it's all about with regards to Trump's hysteria around illegal immigration those are not privileged white men coming into this country in fact he wants to change our immigration laws\nSo that only print privileged white men and their women can come into this country\nThat's why he's demonizing the visa lottery program it mostly as people from Africa coming into the United states this is one voter disenfranchisement is all about this is what you know a gig in interstate cross checking Kris Kobach is all about\nFind those people who have common last names blacks African Americans excuse me a Latino Z and ah and Asians and get them off the voting rules\nUltimately this is what they're called for a constitutional convention is all about I mean this is the direction\nIt is all going right now\nAnd to speed it up\nThe Republicans are actually\nI don't have a clip sheet yet uh Nate I'd I don't know what we've got here but you do have a trumps of five lies yeah I'll I'll I'll do those after another clip shape but I'm here's here's Donald

open borders never has been never will be it's not it's not the Democratic party's position it's not Democrats which in fact Democrats are in favor of a high tech border rather than a stupid border\nOne that allows animals to migrate and things like that but you know catches people\nAnd ... and strengthening our immigration laws\nBut Donald Trump passed to shout out to his frightened to

Bill Clinton was not a sexual predator he was ... list yeah\nAnd like a lot of other presidents before him he acted in on presidential ways but that was his private life and it should never never come to to the surface Monica Lewinsky has always said that it was a consensual adult relationship\nNow with me too movement and everything she's got the perfect out to say well no I was very young and vulnerable\nI agree and I know there you know wanting to Broderick is probably the most credible but there are two women who gives Clinton of rape but that has never been proven or demonstrators and if you know may well be the case\nBut even has promiscuity is problematic for the for the Democrats right now and uh but you know I I agree with your point I ran and I think this is why he's still you know he's still respected and he's still inside the Democratic party\nBut increasingly Democrats are are uncomfortable with Bill Clinton around and I understand why don't you\nWhy I didn't I guess time will tell because China John Fitzgerald Kennedy was way worse than Bill Clinton ... sure\nSure and Enron Roosevelt had amassed here is Dwight Eisenhower administer is\nLyndon Johnson had a minister is in our case W.

the first to say this\nScalia said this\nAlito said this John Roberts said this\nThat they are quote original it's\nWhat does that mean oh we interpret the original meaning of the constitutional who wrote the constitution about half the people in that room or wealthy white slave holders\nAnd all of the people in that room agreed that while I was going to say that\nWomen shouldn't vote I is there actually was a debate about that and they table the debate and they chose not to put anything about women in the constitution in fact the first time there were men men or men was inserted into the constitution was the fourteenth amendment\nAnd Cady Stanton ... case out and said if if that word man is if that were male is inserted into the\nInto the fourteenth amendment to the constitution will take a hundred years to get it out and I literally was a hundred years from now on the fourteenth amendment was ratified until the equal in till the uh the the first equal rights legislation was passed by the U.S Congress\nBut basically I mean do you get this these guys are saying we're originalist we want to interpret the constitution the way a wealthy white slave owner what\nThis is Clarence Thomas the sales pitch do\nThis is a and and and this is why they're going after the visa program the lottery program 'cause hey it brings in people from Africa this is why they want to change our immigration laws\n'cause hey we want more white people from Europe truck themself we want more Norwegians\nThis is one voter suppression is all about with the interstate cross check suppressing the votes of Hispanics African Americans and Asians\nAs Citizens United was all about is what their call for a for a constitutional convention is all about\nAnd in the meantime we've got this bizarre situation where the president of the United states is lying to us buying through his teeth this video ...\nAh first he starts out lying I mean literally making this up Democrats don't want to open borders we want a country and that where you know the United states is sovereign infected Democrats it's been libertarians for years who have argued for open borders this is an old libertarian thing that comes from the objective is from an Rand\nThey say capital money can move across borders goods can move across borders people should be able to move across borders so that labor can go wherever labor is needed for the benefit of industry this is libertarian all the way\nWhich is the Republicans\nSo this this is Ron Paul shtick right it was like if we didn't have welfare programs I be totally in favor of open borders look it up you can find all kinds of YouTube's Ron Paul saying it and Rand Paul for for that matter his own son saying the same thing\nBut Donald Trump says no no it's the Democrats who are thinking like the Syria's\nFor the borders and it said ... it's called\nWith voters bill what's going on and it's written by yes\nDianne Feinstein [noise]\nThis is Donald Trump last night and it's a complete lie I mean literally there's absolutely no truth to it whatsoever\nNow this is like the fifteenth or twenty of time that he's a he's gone out there and pitched the Democrats wide open borders is one of his constant refrain is it is a lie is an absolute author\nBlatant lie\nWhy some aid in appointing this how\nCan you imagine a Brock Obama and come out and said that the Republicans are are you know in favor of\nI don't know something you know equally equally bizarre\n[laughter] you know it's just it's breathtaking video to hear this is Donald Trump talking about on Democrats are going to bring a tidal wave of drugs and crime in other words\nYou know this is ... piggybacking on his lie about open borders in other words they're gonna let round people into this country from Mexico which again Democrats have always been saying you know let's have rational immigration policies we don't want to know from Puerto what are you crazy here's Trump line about this\nBut if the Democrats bill ever becomes law a tidal\nWave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never\nEver before [noise]\n[noise] right and then and then he says and not only that the Democrats want to get free health care health care to all these people that wants to Democrats open the border are going to pour in another lie an absolute lie in fact the law says if you're not a citizen you can't get government assistance you can't get this help but anyhow here's Donald Trump why him through his teeth again Democrats\nDo give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens\nFor it and Harry is saying that the social safety net or Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security which his Republican Party is working to destroy unease line about\nA saying that uh oh that's just for a wealth of course it's for Americans here in the eye and this is why you know one of the things about Social Security is is being kept afloat by all these people in the United states who are not citizens paying into it but then they can't get the benefit from it so it's like a you know it's a multi billion dollar here freebie for Social Security but Trump\nTrump wise about that too areas\nRepublicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly needy Americans [noise]\nSays it's just a complete like this is Donald Trump line through his teeth I mean I should probably shouldn't supplies the Donald Trump ... about how we live through his teeth in his own book are the deal\nHe has a long history of lying to recede and ... including calling up

Bush he didn't work as well you know I I mean you could say worked as a lawyer and that he was getting legal advice\nBut he he was not you know try and cases in courts of law and things like that and he went from being a right wing hatchet man right to the DC circuit\nAnd then he's going from the D.C ... directly from the DC circuit of the Supreme Court she had a guy in the Supreme Court has never argued a case before the Supreme Court in fact the best of my knowledge I maybe early on in his career like in the first year at a law school or something but the best of my knowledge she's never or certainly argue to consequential case before any court at all\nAnd you know he's just been a right when we were right wing hit men\nAnd so the thing that he has to fear is impeached\nOr in the impeachment provision of the constitution applies to all federal officers that includes federal judges that includes members of the U.S Supreme Court and in fact one member of the U.S Supreme Court district chase back in Eighteen oh six or something or was impeached in the house representatives they did not convict him in the center so\nThat's the thing that he has to fear and it would take a sixty six\nVotes in the Senate to make that sticks so I don't think he has a lot to fear around that Terry thanks a lot for the call a may in Avondale Virginia a may what's up\n[noise] Hi I'm I wanted to mention that I Believe this when you were talking about the intolerable consistent lives that are coming out of the president um I Believe the method is called fire hose\nThing and I think it's also used by putting when suddenly um about probably it's usually every strongman all around the world apparently so uh it's a matter of obliterate\nIng the foundation of the truth so that um they're truth can be superimposed over top of that and of course you see in the massive confusion no one knows what to believe\nAnd uh it's a very very sad thing because especially in the disarming of of the office itself but uh as you were mentioning about uh trusting each other as neighbors and news and I presume that also goes with your relationship with us\nThat uh we have the responsibility of trying to find good resources that we know that we can trust that are truthful and to you know a check those things often and share it with those that we know that we can share that with\nUm and I really appreciate your time and I'm mentioning all these things to us that you find my pleasure there\nIs all by the way somebody called earlier and said is there a website that lists all of the candidates and what they have voted for and what their status is and all that\nHe asked I Hope they did that website yeah several people treated too many boats\nSmart dot org and now this is not a site I'm familiar with and I haven't had a chance to check it out it's apparently funded by one guy who's got a video himself on the front page I don't know what his politics are I don't know how accurate it is but there have been a number of people who have Twitter to to me here since we started the show so it's\nAbsolutely necessary because in the midst of what I consider a corporate to um you know they found they can play those sites for and when that happens you know who do you vote for who do you trust to do you believe and I honestly believe that also that ah you know see what they do not

yes thank you I Am a well it's always nice talking with Bob what's going on in the world today\nWell I won't get into cab off yes my question is I Know you've probably been talking about it but I'll give you a few other pieces of news and bad to pontificate if you want me to have an ... so [noise] um I just wanted to go to a couple of stories a strange story week uh first of all the head of Interpol vanished after he took a flight to China\nAre we now find is being held for corruption in China and his name is Ming hunger away and he was also vice minister public a security in China\nI think at one point in time there was denial that you know that they had him but now he is there or they don't relate to corruption to enter pool but they were like corruption you internally and um I just it just sort of denial weight because the ... the big controversy of course\nIn Turkey is the Saudis denying that they have supposedly hacked to death\n...\nWho is a Washington Post contributor right and of course he's a pretty quick quick critic of the Saudi Government\nRight now he's like he was murdered his his fiance was waiting outside the embassy forum waited two days I came back\nShe said he didn't come back out now here's a point to the Saudis let's media and to look around quote which is a harsh and you know if the Saudis said he exit right away after he got a fiancee visa that's pretty easy because everything is recorded in the embassies\nExits and interests and they produced that yeah it's pretty amazing understand can we got politics for a minute Oh yes I just wanted to make sure I got the stories\nIn ... you know you are you have been elected to Congress multiple times you know the Republican Party you used to be inside of it I'm a [noise] Brett Kavanaugh the law though the process the hardcore right winger\nUm you know Donald Trump last night Donald Trump said Democrats have proposed legislation to have open borders these wind through his teeth no Democrat with him and do that no Democrat supports that now and he's been line about Brett Kavanaugh saying you know the the to this is entirely fabricated and it's been entirely debunked\nOr the neither those true to what extent will right wing hate radio on Fox News um both owned by billionaires I should point out um to what extent should they be able to deliver more victories to the Republican Party versus\nYou know the angry and upset a women and the allies of women across the United states who are looking at this as the last gasp of patriarchy\n[noise] ... yeah I don't think that box you know cares of course because look who they just hire desert communications director Hope Hicks\nOh really and the White House has bill ... who was supervising the Kevin ... who himself has been accused of sexual harassment\nIt's the switch you know you got shine and then all of a sudden Hope Hicks now goes to Fox and Hope Hicks was in the White House or as we know you know and a\nVery very close to the president's daughter so I don't think Fox is really looking to ... in any fashion reform have itself has it you know up there entity trying to stretch imagination they will however\nDo what they just did which is to produce\nFor the Republicans especially the right will produce a lot of cover a lot of you know a of of news slanted towards that direction but I Will point now even with that occurring and a lot of money behind it which helps what does that help it helps Republicans that are on a sure how they're going to vote\nBecause you see what I'm saying the bases ginned up to buy the use of money to the corporate media\nSo similar to the question in my mind it you know after Ninety two after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill ...\nThere were a lot of women who got elected Ninety two and um [noise] uh and Bill Clinton got elected Ninety two [noise] what what do you expect the elect the the political consequences of this will be in terms of truly elections\nLets the great question because here's what I think's going to happen\nI'm and I'm going to refer to President Obama for how it's carried out to happen but what I think's gonna happen is first of all their protect people protects Yasser right question about you know all the money spent and it pumped out there and you got a lot of protection and people are watching boxing cetera they give you a protection in your in your base even with senator mansion for example\nThe base it would be calm down even though Mitch McConnell still after him because of his vote\nNow now having said that the repercussions I think are going to be pretty easy there is a no matter how they comforted the root for the vote alright for Kavanaugh the roads going to be very difficult because there is a definite gender gap and the way you look at it including a Republican a female voters\nNot supporting Republicans in general there is a gender gap any way you look at number two\nThere is also a an independent gap now who are up for grabs who may have not went for Hillary Clinton but went for Donald Trump then you come to ... up\nThe conservative base let me I think it was very important and this would worry me if I was sitting Republican\nAnd a half amount of having the the conservative base has fired up but they're happy so they may stay away the progressive base fired up and they are unhappy so therefore if they produce people to get out and vote they will have ... do you think this is a mirror image of the Tea Party the uh\nAll these Republican activists on the streets yelling and screaming and produced a wave of elections for Republicans now you've got the you know a bit of women and their allies on the streets and you know hello and\nAll that familiar with the enemy and if they get the vote out yes they will creative ways yeah something like that in a motel and making sure the Republicans have suppressed them on an individual states I mean you look at George over four hundred thousand people removed from the voting rolls last year by Bryan who's running for governor now ...\nOr any anyhow Bob Ney talking media news thank you\nThank you always good talking with you wonder I bet\nYou are listening Tom
