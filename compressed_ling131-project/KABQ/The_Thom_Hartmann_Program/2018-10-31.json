has gone to Pittsburgh to honor eleven worshipers gunned down at a synagogue\nLibertarians ... hard core conservative are moving more toward\nWhere are you sure because I talked to a lot of people that are typically you know not libertarian are typically conservative and they're voting for Larry star because the Republican we have here is before it's what's known it with the state to act which essentially\nPutting more restrictions on guns the New York um and it was like some of the toughest gun laws of the country and the Republican so now does not support repealing it\nAlmost and and a lot of but most most Republican here in upstate New York tend toward repealing the state's act but because the very sharp supports repealing it and the Republican does a lot of Republicans and even a lot of Trump supporters are moving forward Larry's jar\n[noise] yeah so it looks like there was a only one poll that actually included Larry sharp released this according to we can ... the one you cited appears to have been funded by Larry sharp so uh that's that's interesting the other polling companies completely apparently leaving him out it it appears that true\nYeah yeah well the the anti college bowl with a guy who would not let him out but I I got to talk to\nPeople and I'm I'm I'm shocked at how many people know very sharp is in our planet 'cause I I I did a full you know I my college and more people I get more people who are voting for the brewery Sharpton they were for the Republican\nI'm and I know how many people when you did your poll did you talk to\nSomebody to talk to you about one ear so I'll go into like a professional ball but I Do not I but\nI don't know how to counter where it was it that are that you encountered\nThe the people for your poll\nI'm at my at my college\nI was like wearing what are you in the ... like the quad kind of like one of those places where people can do like political table ing and you know what I mean I Know that\nKnow what I was just what I did was I just walked around and I asked people\nI'm like I went to I like I think I went to one don't me and I asked a couple of people and I went into another building and then I Believe\nHe did it take I just you know I'm just curious to the methodology here how many people did it take to get to twenty meaning was it twenty people that actually answered the poll did you have to ask\nMe I ... it's funny people to answer the poll yeah\nHow many people um did not answer the poll\nWell there were there were like maybe like ten percent of the people that they were undecided or weren't going to vote\nBut how many people ignored you completely\nOh how many people like ... ignored me yeah no I'm not ... well no not medic is what I did when I asked them I said like who are voting for and they can ugly they say yes or I'm not voting at all\nSo you just open up straight up with a question you didn't open up like can I ask you about blah blah blah you just said hey who you are you voting for better so obnoxious like I have a\nVery low I asked him why did at first I said I plan to vote here\nAnd if they said yes I Do you plan to vote in the governor's race this year and then if they said yes I Would ask that I Would move\nOut of Japan ask do you plan to vote this year how many of them said no and end of the conversation right then\nUm maybe like ... or so\nOK I'm surprised I'm surprised I always figure many people would just sort of knowing that people are many people would just say no or just not even you know respond to questions like that I think that ah I actually I\nKnow you said Vincent that it was annoying or whatever but that's what you gotta do to get people to ask you know answer questions you've got to kind of get in their way and you've got to stop them somehow from going about their day because almost everybody's going somewhere to do something right whether they're on the campus or they're walking down main street\nSomebody's going somewhere unless they're just a homeless person sitting in the park and they have absolutely nothing to do in which case yeah\nWell I I feel strongly about it because as a college student in a battleground state as they call it like here is this thing here but I'm going to talk about this ... I got which from a non parties in voting a voting ...

Fox came along and later ... back when it was very limited options and then you know whatever local radio stations you had whatever newspaper\nThere was this thing where you know they'd say oh people commit crimes because they want the publicity right they want to have themselves remembered immortalize they want to get a name you know ah like the you know these classic killers the black widow you know they have these names right and uh\nPeople are still getting named it's just now that's out of the hands of the media now those names happen or you know ... they're they're just they're more they're more decentralized more ridiculous\nMaybe maybe a bit more ridiculous I don't know if they're coming from Facebook for chant or whatever but they're not coming from the media and\nNot not Twitter came from Twitter\nAnd you know I I Will say just as bad as as a as a member of the media are I think it's it's still definitely for me like I wouldn't have remembered I have this guy's ugly face memorized because I have read every felt like a radio ... he was around today when I was at the bar at ... and it's just just give my little social justice point it's I I think the media they\nFocus on ... percent of the perpetrator just so they don't have to focus on why they do these terrible things but they don't want you to know why they do these he liked the issues like shooters certainly mental illness you know that that sort of thing but I'd be if people don't want to face that they just want to say oh look at his cartoon character villain\nWell sometimes I mean depending on the situation sometimes some of their writings will get published I mean there certainly was a uh the the guy here in New Hampshire Thomas ball who didn't kill anybody he killed himself set himself on fire outside of the courthouse they did publish his manifesto\nOr like it was at Columbine via the sheriff's department I serve as a police van kept hit in the basement tapes hidden and I believe a basement tapes have been destroyed now huh\nAll right so a penguin what else go ahead\nYeah so um yeah yeah the bomber the guy that was really they called him I saw him for chair they caught him the mega sooner but did he say claimed that he never he didn't vote for Trump or owner a mega ahead so\nWait what ... bomber or mega by your ...\nYour to are you talking about the synagogue shooter of a guy who mailed the fake bombs\nSo the magna bomber maggots a mega mega shooter but then it turns out he disavowed shore but any way out on a table gab\nHey I don't know the details on the shooter store again I was a you know busy this weekend was ... it was he killed by the cops\nYou know he's ... he living okay and he says he's almost definitely going to get it I mean\nYou know it's a ... different things you almost never hear updates about these people you know once they get put in the system\nAnd they say that they're not parties like well known parties yet and so by the straight up why because here who are very endorsing a\nI mean I'm not saying the news better but it's all Mali Mali Mali Mali Kelly they're going to craft\nA Democrat absolutely other is it only given governor recommendations or is it giving other ones are just this one it just has your shoes and they ... and this just shows how twins day they include the libertarian out all of ... ... ... what you see and there's not enough room on your\nCars right they have a little comparison chart and between the Republican to Democrat with X's in check marks and this shows the state of mind I guess of the left once they because they immediately start out with their issues with a negative right basically what they don't support\nAnd they say will Molly Kelly will stand up to Trump I mean at least I boy I at least say what you do support for you say what you don't support you know what I mean okay well that sounds positive she will stand up to Trump that's not a what ... support\nWhen when they stand up to what annoys they set up to Trump I mean like stand up as like prevent what he's doing I'm saying like I should say what they're for instead of saying what's her again will give me another example what else is ... ... what else ah so supports transitioning to one hundred percent renewable energy\nBy four [laughter] right [laughter] yeah that yeah I think so I've gotten a bunch of these a candidate questionnaires for listeners unfamiliar I Am running an informational race a\nAs a libertarian candidate for state Senate and so I get the you know the whole bevy of uh the various different issues groups right so whether it be the environmentalist or whoever [noise]\nUm so I mean I've definitely heard you know this issue coming up here there was I forget what the name of the organization was it wasn't ... wasn't next Gen um but you know asking about the environmental like well yeah it's great if\nYou know if we can do renewable energy voluntarily cool\nDo it you know if people want to fund a subsidies for people buying solar power voluntarily awesome I got no problem with that that that makes sense um\nWorks for me yet behind the thing that you support if you think this thing is the future of energy than throw your money into it invest in those companies get out there in ...\nThe people you know money to incentivize them to look at the type of energy you think is best but what the people want to do is force everybody to pay for their vision of what energy creation and a conservation should look like\nAnd it's so ridiculous and dry Coney invent even like even some hardcore life these are remember my my home town of ... Hanover New Hampshire ... of the city passed like you know for one hundred percent renewable by twenty fifty\nAnd based design at the same way as a Soviet five year plan right they say oh we're going to do X Y and Z and they have obviously no method to gauge probably successful even\nUh like some of the horror or dead by then or are they older voters made up new voters by that and I it's like they say it's not going to work even ... showed up there and they said this is not going to work the types of batteries you're trying to advocate for not able to store but charge and\nYou know over just drowned out and booze that applause for whatever the yoga via politician says I stand up for the environment I Love the fact that it's just everyone stops thinking and applauds\nWhat the other thing is that ah when they take money by force through taxes and then they give it to a designated industry in this case let's say it's the solar power the lender hydroelectric or whatever what cylinder\nCylinder it was a it was Obama's thing and it turns via they say oh it's going to be your subsided a solar industry and it turned out to be a boondoggle that accompanies named ... yes if it was just like tax payers of the tax payers subsidizing a company and then you know whoever was investing and it may not like bandits and sure what solar panels have anything to have babies no solar panels by cylinder since\nThey don't have the incentive for excellence right right if you're guaranteed a check or if you get a grant a to where you're not actually responsive to what the market once and the market may want solar power it's just that your beholden to making bureaucrats happy now\nYou're not trying to make your customers happy there maybe a handful of customers who sure to appreciate a subsidy coming in from the government and certainly the business owners like you're saying the board of directors or whoever stockholders are probably very happy to have a bunch of funneled money coming into their company but it doesn't create excellent that doesn't create an excellent product\nIt doesn't create an affordable a product as far as you know real price of whatever those things are 'cause it's being subsidized\nSo it's a it's like a form of laundering money be as the uh the lobbyist for that company they they give campaign donations or just straight up bribes or they give shares I talked to family members of a politician but politicians takes a stolen tax money gives it to them and they just use it to first stock buybacks poll\nThat that's OK when the left does it it's okay when politicians right right because it happens on both sides are but surely one side's completely blind to the other so All right so you were handed these things did you have any ... any conversations with the people who\nI don't want to like ... like I I Try and be nice to everyone but in this case I wouldn't say hate the righteous indignation just because of that one instance I had if a person who gets politely asked not to put ... cover over people's posters and were like hey man why do you want to why are you so salty about getting young people to vote\nAnd that's the whole thing it's like everywhere that people are buying ads in the paper people are like posters everywhere emails ... everyone we got to go out and vote you got to get out and vote you got to go out and vote\nAnd no one has ever no one even entertains B I didn't know what the mayor said right the idea that maybe these people that they say to vote for they don't care about you\nWrite maybe there is no one to vote for because they're all terrible advocating for tyranny and they want all of us to be slaves\nAll right so the toll free number here is eight fifty five four fifty free I mean if you want I don't know what you wanna do that we could go down that list and just you know tear it apart limb from Lynn over some stuff you buy like on the right or yeah so I mean please let's go on\nSo this next one supports ending the border patrol checkpoints on interstate Ninety three\nOkay okay All right I'm In favor of that I'm Still not gonna vote for or do of\nCourse on they don't even they don't even ... like they say that because it's a hot button issue right it's always gets libertarians on board but they're not even going to get any thought\nNo returns to maybe you'll these aren't ... move there and these aren't targeted at libertarians these this is a straight up Democrats lie overturned it young people yeah definitely I\nMean look the fact is people on the left are probably more likely to be on the correct side of the immigration issue\nOr that's one of those issues where they're they're they're more likely I'm not saying that's true of all of them I'm sure there's a bunch of them were like well we still need to have a process we still need to have a government involved in immigration but at the very least they probably don't like the idea of checkpoints\nThis next one here are supported supported stronger state level gun safety measures what does the ... vote lead silliest way to phrase that question gun control absolutely what that is I mean it's hard\nFor them they have to be easily uh in New Hampshire because it's hard to push any gun control through in New Hampshire\nAnd so even the leftist if you actually go to the hearings where they they're proposing new gun control restrictions almost everybody who testifies like\nLook I understand the right to bear arms and I support that they always have to practice their gun control statements with statements of how pro gun they are because that's the only thing that actually flies in New Hampshire you some professors\nOthers that are before\nWe don't have to about ... to get it but I just love how the picture of Mali Kelly's first smiling and so new to him look like an ogre that they they chose those pictures well it's not hard to do for somebody to come on baby fat right

Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro says now is not the time for President Trump to come to Pittsburgh\nThat ... that has a negative connotation or not but I have any love for for vote Republican\nBut you know clearly it's clearly skewed right I mean surely if you went and talked to this guy the Republican and you said you support education being cheaper of course he'd say yeah of course well who would say oh no it should be more expensive no one would say that even now\nYou know you'd have to be totally insane to say that education should be more expensive but yet they're claiming oh she supports education being cheaper but he doesn't\nWhich is just ridiculous now of course if you actually do want education to get cheaper you have to get the government out of it entirely pretty much\nAnd allow educational\nA competition where these institutions that have been around forever and they can just charge whatever they want to charge a because they're getting government loans and money you're basically free money from the government or what is it is it called Fannie Mae forget is that the housing one I forget there's like nothing I've already ... ... oh no no these are names um anyway but you can't Kobe\nYou can't declare bankruptcy rep see with these student loans or you're\nBasically become ... guaranteed this money so they just keep on increasing and keep on increasing the rates whereas in the marketplace if there was actually a free market in education\nThey wouldn't be guaranteed any money they actually have to oh I don't know satisfy their customers with a quality education at an affordable price and if it was a true free market than there would be no limit the number of institutions that could be created\nA and then therefore course price would go down and and\nJust I'll just add by ... by giving guaranteeing everyone right every young person or whoever ... alone or that gives the colleges but go ahead to just raise it raised to aim toward it ended up people who don't people who don't belong in college right you know people who say I don't that don't have a career plan or darned getting a degree for grad\nWho should be better to go into trade school we're getting an apprenticeship are able to go to college in ways for years partying and that's\nPart of the propaganda is the idea that you need to go to college oh you won't be successful\nSo I Need a college degree to get on here I mean yeah I'm On the radio and you don't think I have a college degree now I don't have a college\nDegree no uh I guess I technically do I have an associates an arts degree and count\nSeats the grapes I only have that because um I wanted to ... it was the wrong thing to do I wanted to make my mum happy though I you know I went to college and I went you know and it was was pointless was a waste of time wasted money go into the next item\nSo that's what I I didn't even know it was an issue right I I like to think I keep my you're close to ground politics opposes diverting public school funds to private schools\nOh that's definitely an issue or from the left right because they feel like\nIf we take away money from the government schools than our children will suffer because the government schools\nOr the last line of education and if we don't have them we will have an ignorant populace\nJust so ridiculous that we don't already have an ignorant pop absolute but I ... diverting to private school aside I didn't hear every time I like the\nThe voucher down yeah some states have there's some states don't there is a I don't know if some doctors the right term and I'm not intimately familiar with this but there is a system in New Hampshire it was put in place within the last several years and it was actually some of the liberty people who I think worked on this legislation\nOr that essentially allows families to divert a certain amount of money that's already been taken from them stolen money or diverted to some kind of private institution to educate their kids\nIt may be a voucher or some sort of variance on\nThat I just love is the money that's that should have already been bears they should never have given ... been taken by the government for public schools that they're not benefiting prior using a and it just makes me so sick and you know these people these shells\nOr who just you'll rule who are rude to be I Know so many people on campus who say drivers not voting or specifically voting down the line Republican just despite these people you know you're more likely to know the Republicans on campus because I'm not at all just like people in classes like I remember when my friends and the rise counterproductive you know this is ... well\nI mean just from the people I've talked to but yeah it's kind of products are they all have students historically vote left I mean the argument but if I\nHad to vote but when they do they tend to be ... yeah but you know that's that's the key to what you say it's hard to get them to vote but her trying so hard veteran shutting this every one space shuttle everyone's face that they just out of ... like that all of them are going to vote out of spy but some of them are like really I got\nI this is your third year in in college you're entering your third year so you were there and twenty sixteen is it worse this year\nOh absolute by far really oh yeah oh yeah everywhere just posters everywhere\nThe voter's guide like this handed out you don't see\nHow many like this isn't the only organization so many of them it's like burgers and so I you know talk about this blue wave it's like a blitzkrieg wow that is interesting and you know of a variety of Republicans or conservatives or whatever or even the libertarians to a verb are nowhere to be found on campus\nWell yeah I mean if a if I hand out flyers on campus for long enough I Will get get no trespass off campus because what happens is somebody and I've done it countless times it's not just say I haven't gotten away with that I was there when that happened and I usually go in and I hit them fast\nIn like one a class change right 'cause there's usually like ten Fifteen minute period between classes\nAnd I'll go in all zoom in with you know a fifty two hundred flyers and I'll Try to hand them all out within ten or Fifteen minutes and usually I'm successful at getting at least fifty out\nBut then if I stay too long there is a good chance somebody's going to call campus security and so\nSome of the meal and you're you're always you're always\nAccommodating cordial non

being rude to people and nothing's happened we're still on their spring river propaganda BS\nAll right how are they not getting thrown off campus they have a permission slip I bet no no no\nBecause usually the permission slip won't allow you to walk around and he was allowed to have all kinds of jokes that in that case you know there's more coming up here in moments but you're saying they're

started about students voting ... will have to define them in her and we have no say in mountain folk will go to college except me we\nWill have to define the term flat land or because maybe some people haven't heard of before the thing I didn't hear about until I moved here uh you know as part of this New Hampshire freedom migration\nBut first we're going to go to your phone calls and thoughts or by the way and do what you didn't know about any pay dock level where do you live in the mountains or the flat land or any paid a global as long as you got Internet there wherever it is you live you can accept crypto currency like bitcoin BTC or dash as well as\nThe stand and more go to any paid on global even get signed up can't be any easier to to sign up I mean in fact I've argued it's actually too easy a to sign up because you don't even have to verify and email address you can just create any old user name you want and any old password you want and sign up with that\nAnd there's no verification which again I've ... criticized that just simply from a error checking a you know if somebody screws up there let's say they use an email address they screw it up it's wrong how and you forget your password right and then they can't yeah\nThey didn't know what they put it in because they thought they put in the writing anyway so that's my critique I Do my critique them any day but I Love them I think they do great work the system itself works great just be careful when you're sending out make sure you get your right a username and password in there\nAnd he paid our global is where you sign up and then you put in your bitcoin or whatever other crypto wallet addresses and set up a page\nAnd then you load the app on your point of sale device that's it you're ready to roll I mean we're talking about maybe a ten minute set up time if you if you've already got a cryptic grants the wallet we're talking about five to ten minutes set up time and a super easy to get started and except crypto to point of sale any pay ... global\nAs we go to Robert he's in Vermont listening to us on our discord server over at discord dot L. aren't on FM hey Robert\nHey what's on your hey welcome thank\nYou oh you were talking about voting system here in our conversation with somebody the other day about\nComing\nI kind of want to talk show clear again news yeah sure we'll be able to craft shows no towards so I can vote and not have to worry about it being lost in any way\nThat's a question that's an excellent question he is looking at me because I I may know something about this\nThis this and this has been tried over the years to just set up secure Internet voting systems I don't have all the details in front of me right now but what I Do remember is that it's never worked right they've never been able to secure a ...\nWay of women women let me stop you for a minute okay seems that the production for emails\n\nOr email ... ... email all not at all it's\nNot right at the correct me if I'm wrong in this Michael any point along the email chain because when you hit send on email you email you know one of the host hit friend it goes through your email server than bounces around multiple servers around the Internet before it actually finally reaches its death wherever it's going and it's not encrypted\n... yeah most of the time it's unencrypted uh if you have a Gmail account it will show you whether that email was encrypted in transit across the Internet or not but\nI think crypto by by by each server as that goes along\nJust meaning that who wouldn't be able to read it then 'cause it in and say okay because the server itself obviously has has an unencrypted but nobody's going to read it in between here and there\nPresent many NSA doesn't go and subpoena or the\nServer and say oh well we need to see all the emails around this particular emailer to this particular email or whatever so\nIf you want to protect it on the server you still have to encrypted yourself which means many gp right [laughter] so anyway so there are ways to do encrypted email is just\nProbably Ninety nine point nine nine percent of emails are not encrypted because it takes a little bit of time to encrypted email with wind set that up and you got to put a browser as on learning curve pressure even ...\n... what about the question is it should be able to show up to my\nShow does not yet anyway\nSo Michael you pointed out that the governments have failed in their attempts at doing some sort of voting on line and corruption or or whatever\nBut of course that's what we should expect from the government right it's failure they fail it out just about everything they do when they actually do accomplish something is because they threw enough money at it so like yeah the government gets a school built cars they hire some company and throw millions of dollars at them and then eventually a school gets built right\nIt doesn't mean the school wouldn't cost less in a competitive market it sure as hell would because if there was actually a marketplace for these things\nOr they would be developed quickly there would be developed efficiently and affordably but when the case of a voting it's all government so they can hire a company to do this but again then we are getting back to the issue we discuss before where\nOr when it was the solar company you were talking about ... where if the company is getting a bunch of money they don't have an incentive to develop the system very securely they don't have to an incentive to develop a system\nOr in an efficient manner they can charge whatever it is they want per hour or per line of code or however it is they char and above all of that I forgot to solve or some of her communists bits that I don't care who voting for I care who council vote\nCorrect and that's so again it's the government that's that is failing it this but it's the government that runs the votes so the odds that this system is going to be perfected\nOr workable in any near future you know scheme is fairly unlikely plus just trying to change the system at all is very very unwieldy right I mean you've got a system where it basically works the same as it did two hundred\nThen we can add you to a list of when we're not on the air so we go off the air or from twitch at ten pm eastern time tonight\nWell there's no show even though there's shows on al are indata sandwiches uh twenty four hour a day\nA liberty radio network there is no live show here in Keene New Hampshire at that time so there's nothing that goes on which channel it's just like a a screen that says ah you can listen to our audio streams right and so auto hosting means that if you are watching us a twitch dot L. are endowed at them and we go off the air\nAnd let's say one of our other listeners happens to be streaming video games at that time\nIt will switch to them\nInstead of just ... right so it's kind of a way for\nTwit streamers to kind of share their audience around with one another and I guess the idea is that generally you'd want to reciprocate right so like if somebody who's a auto hosting your channel you might want out of ... anyway uh he asked about that hey would you put my channel up there I was like you know it's not a bad idea\nI had to do a little experiment in because there was the one thing I was concerned was was well if we auto host these channels what's that going to do to the embedded feats because if you go to ... than the liberty radio networks front page there's an embedded a window to twitch that shows our video feed when it's live and so I'm thinking well\nI don't want video games being played on the L are in in ... meaning if somebody goes to the L or another them page they're looking for a libertarian talk radio that's the reason why they're there they don't want to see Vincent playing you know whatever game he would play or even Freeman playing you know whatever game I Would play\nAlthough they'll see it if it's me because then we're we're doing it for the streams purpose\nA button generally if it's you know just listeners I didn't want that because it seems to kind of be counter to the main point to that video\nIt doesn't do that so you actually have to be on the channel page which ... them and then\nYou'll see whatever is being hosted so I say all that just kind of announced that that's a change and then also to let you know that if you have a an active twitch channel I don't want to Idaho somebody that doesn't actually regularly stream\nSo you have to have some level of dedication to it right um then let me know you can send a message on the discord over discord dot L. are endowed at them you can message me on mastodon I wanted to liberate on server there and those are a couple of different ways you can send me an email as well just let me know what your twitch handlers and I'll go and check out\nSo you can follow us on which uh we've got over five hundred followers now twitch dot L. R. N. dot at them which by the way isn't a whole lot to brag about I mean there's these twitch people they've got names and have hundreds of thousands if not millions\nOf followers there are at any moment millions of people who are not only streaming but many more millions are actually watching these streams I don't know what the average stream receives I suspect it's not a whole lot but some of these people are are absolute superstars in this in this arena\nIn fact they even had boobs oh especially if they've got those um and yeah and even they have like apparently they have their own convention now and I don't know for how many years they've had this but they you know these people are such big stars they show up at these conventions and it's like they get asked for autographs\nAnd you know girls want to take their picture with them and it's just amazing that you know Michael when you and I were were ... because we're kind of we're basically contemporaries in an age we're pretty close pretty much uh when we were growing up\nThe the land party was hardly was a thing\nBut if you've been to a land party can you describe the attendance of the land party um it is it young teenage male it was\nAnd it probably still is majority these days but there are females\nWho are involved now whether it's because these males are getting paid very well to do what they do but I think it's just because gaming has become more of a um a by party ... universal ... that tracks males and females more so now than it than it did in the past and the land party was pretty much the ah [noise]\n... the ... the area of the ... the computer geek you had to be a geeky kind of game or not some average gamer do you know you'd have to like know how to move your PC around and kind of set up a network and and and play the games with each other now they actually have land party conventions\nAnd I suspect that goes on at the convention\nIt's it's a bit larger than one land but yeah the they have whole warehouses where everyone brings in their ... thousands of of computers and everyone's gaming right there but yeah back in the back in the day I mean we've had that you were saying you have to be geeky in somewhat or what was the word you used\nI don't know dorky video game ... right computer techie you'd we didn't have a lot of women back then aiming we do now a lot more than we did did a little\nBit like any any like a sub culture thing that that's mainly on usually is primarily guys that becomes popular eventually like like like take libertarianism for instance the liberty movement so called women are eventually going to be attracted to that because I ever won\nThey might feel five ... legitimately interested or to they want you know they pretend to be interested because they liked the attention will be thirsty guys give themselves you know anyone could get good at video games right it did not say not all of them have passions but quite a few aunts and that's how some movements get ruined because like you know you have\nA all these guys fight over this one was like yo go or you know eventually they changed things and uh yeah that's how it how it gets ruined\nI think that games are a little bit more than what you're saying but I think that is true generally what like what you're saying well I was gonna say game or gay but I was ... gaming journalism ruined that but uh yeah yeah now you're going back several years a this was a controversy over a video game reviewer who is female weddings on either\nSide and it follows follows closely talked about it here on the air but it was about a decade ago it was about ethics in gaming\nJournalism because like go talk to and all these gaming or if it's so ridiculous right these gaming journal is a riot a day I think like there's this one gate and game called depression quest made by someone a class\nAnd it did not deserve to win but ever has been alec get her ... her ex boyfriend said that she allegedly a slapped with a judge's I feel like to in order to to win and then the gaming or\nThe gaming journalism base that anyone who who criticized batteries and brought into question was sexist and then now we have all these you know All right so that's pretty much the older I was born out of game are gay or they feel right on YouTube so\nComing up here ah tonight we are going to talk about a gab and what happened there with this centralized social media sites has been taken down now after this shooting\nA that happened if it was over the weekend a friday or whenever it was but it was you know I was being reported on heavily I think it was Saturday when the news first like I say dumped has better 'cause it's not like it was taken down by the government or and if he was just

I think I heard about from Chris can't well or maybe it was you up and said I'm not sure but\nYou know there's this there's been this purge that's been going on amongst many of these centralized a controlled managed social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook the purchase haven't aren't new the Facebook news of them based book delete it eight hundred pages remember that one from a few weeks ago that's not new\nI mean the story was new but it's not new that Facebook's been deleting pages it's not new that Facebook has had a draconian a content policy restrictions and all that and a Twitter of course seems to favor lefty Twitter ... tweeters Twitter as a over righty torturers now of course I'm not either one of those things\nBut I Know that if somebody a Twitter gets a hair up there but and they decide this week we don't like libertarian you know then we're just they're going to sweep without ... and ... it's\nNot just the social media to the host and companies also I mean like it'd be a began with the what was the Daily Stormer which is near like a straight a neo Nazi website after Charlottesville he got kicked off so it used to be ... Bennett was dot H. K.\nAnd then they they went through all these different um I was called domain name may name's until finally I I Know they've they've they've found one but ah\nAnd then that's what I Believe happened to gab\nSo gab sprang up though it's sort of a response right sort of I mean it seemed like this I'm sure the owner of it would deny it but gap seemed like the right wing response to the left wing sort of ousting of right wing or ...\nWhatever you know you're you just about nearly quoted an article I read from reason to okay and I have not read that are very ... because every time you know someone gets kicked off from like Twitter one of these places social media companies and they said this isn't fair above a response always is oh why don't you start your own crazy\nYeah absolutely and I think that's the right response because there's some people who are like we need to regulate Twitter no no that's what can't well been saying like no no no no\nWe're not even letting them start their own companies because you have a what was it uh get 'em what happened to gab now ...\nThat's what we're going to get into here is going to given the backstory of like where this thing came from gap seemed to have been started as a sort of a right wing response but they positioned themselves not as right wing all they adopted the frog icon which sort of has become like it's kind of this right wing ... the puppy a has a very another well exact ...\nCopyright trademarks I Can't use it but they do have a frog fraud I I I'd phrase it because I've been on ... for a while but I quit\nA ... it's I they it's like for anyone right you can be like a total communism is set up there\nBut it's not for everyone because there's just you know mainly right wires walk there and are you on the Nazis flocked there and it's like if you're if you don't believe in our board hired minds are one of many\nHigh by a few minds on there you're not going to feel comfortable because everything you post is going to get screamed at her down voted or wherever by some white supremacist or something like that yeah yeah right wing rosy person\nSo um and so my experience there I did join it and just to see what it was like right like okay well no it wouldn't hurt to be on another platform and and then I look to see if there will be an easy way to syndicate might pose to it and there wasn't so like it didn't work with I of ti ti ti which is a nice website that makes it easy to kind of cross post on\nDifferent areas ah different websites and so it was just like oh well you know I posted a few times to it and never really did anything with it but it was sort of like oh it's there in case you know maybe I'll need another platform I could go back if we need some and this was before I found out about mass did on so I didn't even know that master non existent will get into what that is you're in a moment\nBut according to our T. dot com social media platform gab where Pittsburg synagogue shooter or the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter had a page is about to lose its hosting provider now this is from the weekend they have apparently lost it I have you tried to go to the gas all they\nAll they have up as a as a statement from the c._e._o. which is interesting that they haven't been told that the the the website itself is down there is just like a little uh it's from the site or a graph from CEO from CEO of gap because if the hosting provider had pulled their hosting\nThen there would be nothing there until they got another site set up so they must be operating on another rave got well they like it doesn't take much to put up a single payer I can run that on a raspberry pie right rabbit leave it rang a bell dot com renting a whole social media platforms ... that's a lot more ... a lot of computing uh then you know in this room\nSo ah anyway joins was gaps hosting provider they sent a warning message that because of an unspecified quote breach of the joint in terms of service unquote they will be pulling the plug on gab on Monday morning earlier pay pal cut off contact with the social network after an avalanche of media reports\nPointed out that Robert Ballard who killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday\nHad a page there now or spinal poster poorly accused the Jewish refugee protection NGO of bringing quote invaders end of the United states and in in ended in an ominous quote I'm going in\nOn learning of his identity gap says it took down ... hours page but not before backing it up and sending it to the FBI the gap is behaving in in the exact same way as Facebook and Twitter taking down controversial pages and not actually allowing people to observe\nWhat these nut jobs are doing I find this one of those frustrating aspects of these a centralized social media companies is they are doing the bidding of the governments\nOthers more coming up your moments at three o'clock life we have some good news the indictments against raw celebrate in the district of Maryland\nThis messed with prejudice meaning they can never be re filed this is especially good because those indictments contain the only charge ever made that Ross engaged in murder for higher this was a serious allegation that rolls or break denies it was never prosecuted or\nRode on by a jury but was trumpeted by the federal government and the media as if it were proven fact the Maryland court held these indictments for almost\nFive years poisoning brought this case and leaving him under a cloud of unproven allegations as explaining\nRoss's appeal to the Supreme Court the fact that the judge use these allegations to give her all the draconian sentence of double life without parole violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial judges are required

R. N. dot at them now as I was saying earlier yes I understand discord is a centralized platform and yes they got to hear up there but uh they could pull our chat server and it will be\nGone but you know what it's fun to do it so you know just because something centralized doesn't mean it's not useful right in in a moment in any given moment some use of a centralized service can be productive it can be useful\nThere was a time when Facebook felt like it was productive there was a time when Facebook felt this you know it's been a long time but\nIt's been at least several years since this time existed but it did exist where it felt like you could reach people on Facebook it felt like the post that you made were being seen and that's just not the case anymore\nAnd against the central services are useful for a time\nBut you know there's there's even if discord did do something like that there is there are decentralized alternatives to to discord diversify our but gee oh there's there's something like mumble\nMumble is if you if you're going to do like voice chat yeah I mean so\nDiscord is a gaming system ultimately it was created with the intention of people being able to talk to one another during video games are very low light and see\nA quick or easy way to hear somebody saying something that is is fast and the software is slick it's easy to use and it turns out it's so useful that other people have just blown up discord service that have nothing whatsoever to do with gaming uh we've got a gaming channel on our discord but it's almost never used on the voice ... you know action right\nNow but in theory if somebody wanted to use that they they could there are other channels where people just talked to one another and\nAnd again it's useful they could shut you down but while it's there have fun with it why not\nUm and the nice thing is you're using their server and it doesn't cost us money so you don't have to you know sort of like would you too yeah YouTube is pretty crappy a lot of ways but the fact is\nThe freaking channel is there it's got over Fifteen thousand uh subscribers that it's taken a decade to uh to gain by no means is that a big channel\nBut I'd prefer to not lose the ten thousand or Fifteen thousand subscribers that said I Do understand that they could be pulled away from the moment's notice but while they're there\nI'm going to send them stuff oh yeah I Want them to be able to see the the contents again I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with using centralized servers but if you want to protect yourself from attack\nIf you want to protect yourself from these political wins which is what we're talking about the reason why gab was shut down is because of the political whims of the people running the hosting company pay pal or stripe or whatever I mean I don't start in ...\nThey think it's like the whims of them because you know business as opposed to make money right every ounce money's good it's all green I think it's probably like screeching from\nUsers and also some sort of like group like the S P L C ... any of these bully anti free speech bullying groups who go around and say we're going to smear you if you don't kick these people off or it could just be direct government interference\nIt could be if it's probably all of the above and you know these companies want to pander to one of these groups then it's ultimately\nTheir choice and so in order to defend yourself in order to protect your content the the information your generating you can decentralized you have options Michael we're going to get into a list that you brought up from reason dot com here in a moment but first we go to Sarah she's in New Mexico you're on free chocolate fellow Sarah\nAh yeah I think that one of them are ...\nMillion dollar for the federal clan who was\nAn average bar for what to do with our why do I want to live in Indiana\nAfter a while that gap and make it a try it on my three ... and that I mean what about like hey\nWell oh here's what I Want to know how is it that widening aside what makes it safer pedestrians I mean I could understand that if somebody with a wheelchair can't fit on the sidewalk I understand that you know there's some value for that uh but how is it that it's more safe if it's wider for pedestrians\nWhat what are they might have got bigger like why why are they play it by\n...\nOkay hold on now that's wait a minute you're missing something there Sara because if you're talking about a car that's barreling down\nAt forty five miles an hour heck even thirty five miles an hour the typical kind of in cities speeds or if you've got a car barreling down on you at that speed\nTwelve inches or twenty four inches of a wider a sidewalk is not going to be a second or two different it's not barely going to be a fraction of a fraction of a second to a different he and I just pulled the stuff that apparently this actually is a thing in the in the city of Albuquerque is they are as you say he's not a liar either a lot of cases in some\nOf them are it looks like there actually is something that like there's a fire hydrant blocking the fire heart in in a telephone pole like so close to each other that you can't you can't get a wheelchair through there\nI see what you're saying there but I'm Talking about as far as your car running up on the sideline I don't get a look if somebody wants to just ... whether they're doing it on purpose or they're doing on accident if somebody pulled their car up onto a sidewalk you're gonna get hit unless you're paying close attention and are able to get away\nAnd jump out of the way or two before that car hits you\nWhether or not it's a you know twenty four and sidewalk or forty eight and sidewalk or sixty four inch sidewalk or whatever is going to be pretty much immaterial unless they're putting up a barrier between the road and the sidewalk and I don't just mean a curb\nUnless they're putting up some sort of a barrier like London you know after all of his truck attacks they have to put up barriers on street sure there's a there's the barriers that are are full of water there's the just the concrete kind of pile on a there's all kinds of you know potential barriers they could put up\nOh get the green light [noise]\nHey DC for a limited time at work you can get to complete pair of glasses

Seventy six and seven eight respectively those two decisions where the first time in the history of the United states\nLiterally from the founding of the republic until Nineteen Seventy six the first time in the history of the United states that the Supreme Court\nThat giving money to a politician was constitutionally protected right\nNo Congress ever proposed is no president ever proposed this no state ever proposed is in fact the opposite\nCongress has passed numerous laws regulating money in politics as has and they've been signed into law by numerous presidents enthusiastically and and some states even had visited this written into the constitution in addition to laws\nAll got struck down by the Supreme Court and then this Scott amplified even greater and twenty town when the five conservatives the five Republican appointees on the court\nOr you know wrote\nPass the the Citizens United decision and then twenty Thirteen McCutcheon which said basically if you're a billionaire you can own an unlimited number of politicians up to that point you could only on something over two hundred politicians seriously there was this law\nThese are the ... if you look at just the coax the Walmart and the Mars family those three well dynasties they own a combined three hundred and forty eight billion dollars\nYou imagine what we can do with it\nI mean I don't want all of it each one of them can have the I'm going to be paid let them keep a billion dollars each it's fine with me\nOr if you look at the Fifteen wealthiest families multiple members on the forms four hundred list the wealth of every single one of those families came from companies started by an earlier generation\nCombined those Fifteen families there were six hundred and Eighteen billion dollars\nUh and and they make the they they point out contrary to the right wing view that the vast vast lay on equal wealth distribution in American society is your own avoidable results of market forces no it's not\nThere's nothing inevitable about it because once once the Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled that giving money to politicians are using money to buy legislation was protected by the first amendment guess why rich people started pouring money into the coffers of politicians\nAnd politicians have been doing what they want\nNow Benjamin page and Jason see right and Matthew calling my writing over at the guardian\nThey did they did an exhaustive study of the hundred wealthiest ... billionaires and the United states over ten year period all their public statements and what they're actually lobbying for\nThe question I'm asking here by the way is what do we do about our billionaire problem we have a problem with the morbidly rich here in the United states\nI personally think a wealth tax\nIf you if you have a ... if you have wealth in excess of a billion dollars\nThen every year you pay one percent of everything above a billion dollars to the government\nI realized that's considered can fiscal tore right you know it's literally the government taking somebody's money\nIt is good for American society it's good for democracy and it's not going to hurt these families\nIf you've got a hundred and five billion dollars like the Koch brothers and you have to pay a billion dollars in taxes every year\nUntil you're down to just one billion dollars which is not going to happen in your lifetime that that somehow gonna harm you\nI'm not buying it taking away people's health care\nLike Rick Scott that fat causes people to die\nSo what is it that the wealthiest people are doing they they looked at the hundred wealthiest billionaires and United States or a ten year period\nAnd what they found was that most of America's wealthiest billionaires resemble Charles Koch politically quote obsessed with cutting taxes especially the estate tax which only applies to the wealthiest Americans himself posed a government regulation of the environment opposed to government regulation of big banks\nUnenthusiastic about government programs to help with the jobs to help maintain income of working people to provide health care to American people or for retirement pensions they broadly oppose all these things are they just don't care and they're all in favor of cutting or privatizing guaranteed Social Security benefits\nThe question what do we do about this\nWhat should we do a lot

with us here and what billionaires want and you know this ... like I said this is this has become a crisis for America and it's not just oh yeah billionaires are all on all of it is that wealth inequality right now and the United states is worse than it literally has ever been\nEven worse than Nineteen twenty nine which brought about the great crash\nAnd one of the things that we know about wealth inequality is that it\nIs socially destructive\nOr Richard and a Cape Pickens and richer and do what's his last name any out will come to be a veto wrote this book called the spirit which are Wilkinson wrote this book called the spirit level\nAnd another book called why any quality matters\nThey have a whole website on this stuff and what you find is that the more on an equal of society is\nThe greater the distance between the very rich and the very poor\nThe more unequal society is\nThe more you had the higher rates you have of of uh diseases of all kinds of a drug addiction\nOf alcoholism of teenage pregnancies of of a sexually transmitted diseases\nOf unwanted pregnancies at abortion and says well of a crime\nOf homicide and suicide\nAll of the socialist higher rates of mental illness higher rates of depression lower rates of social engagement lower rates of civic participation including voting all of these social ills\nCome out of a small group of people in this case literally in just a few thousand people in the United states are a few thousand families and the state's owning something like Seventy eighty percent of the entire wealth of the country\nThree guys owning fifty percent of the wealth of the entire country three men have accumulated half of this country is wealth\nOr a lot of wealth equal to that at the bottom half of Americans\nNow that's

points gym the one the one thing that I Would add the the the the the ... that I Would I that I Would add to that are put on that is that\nThis has to be done at the level of public policy if you ask the majority of Americans and Jim thank you for the call I eat them very well said if you ask the majority of Americans if they agree with what Jim just said that that just very very clear and well articulated list\nYes the majority of Americans will say yeah those are all things these are our values\nBut if you look at what gets put into legislation none of it's happening\nExcept you know in a few obscure places here and there are a little you know in some places in California but you know but everybody agrees with is that why is that that's because as I was talking about the very beginning of this hour in Nineteen Seventy six and Nineteen Seventy eight the United States Supreme court for the first time in the history of the United states\nSaid that for rich people to give money to politicians to by politicians and bus to by public policy those to by legislation\nWas protected by the first amendment of the United states has free speech and then the same thing for corporations corporations don't have mild but they had that free speech rights their persons so money is the way that they speak\nAccording to the Supreme Court that was the first national bank versus ... decision in Nineteen Seventy there was authored by Lewis Powell\nThe guy who authored the pollen and mold Nineteen Seventy one saying here's how rich people corporations here's how we rise up and take over the country well they rose up and took over the country and Donald Trump is the logical extension point of all that\nAnd and if we're you know and and it's not enough to say oh you know these rich people this is so destructive\nThey all should do like Bill gates is done and give half has money to a foundation and started you know funding things and you know a fist starting charter schools and things\nNo these shipping government functions we shouldn't be taxing these people I mean it's just very straightforward and the government should be responsive to win the people not the people who own them we need to reverse the Buckley decision ... decision the Citizens United decision\nGeorge in Altoona, Pennsylvania and George what's up\nOh Warren ... what you were talking earlier about the um financial expansion of the wall and family yeah\nA sore point out along with the ... it's also for the fact that they expanded their um enterprise back in the eighties I used to live up in New England area and there was one Wal Mart\nJust outside of Hartford, Connecticut and I wouldn't see another one for\nNo idea what you're saying George but when I said they made their money on their investments the Walton family is not running Walmart\nThey own a massive amount of Wal Mart's stock and his Walmart got bigger and wealthier they got bigger and wealthier to the same with the ... same with the family they all they all inherited massive amounts of stock or bart majority ownership and these companies\nAnd but they're not running up and down the Koch brothers exception they're actually running Koch Industries but the Mars family and the wall and family that I'm running them they're just they're just in there there are a passive investors and they've gone from being worth a billion to being worth a hundred billion\nThat was why they are putting their fathers\nAnd they're profiting from the way that the Senate has been ... by legislation that was written on behalf of

laid to rest corresponding gene ... says the ... members of the community\nJoy find or Seventy five years old they say about\nYeah Chris thanks for the question I I think one of the things that we've been trying to do and by way of talking about the Democrats in general\nIn most districts are talking about you know what we want to do which is a for the people in the country right or things like health care without question the number one issue of this election cycle has been healthcare\nWe're watching Republicans after voting time after time after time to take away a and risk your protection for pre existing conditions or through all the votes they didn't Congress and through lawsuits that you know states like Wisconsin are part of\nAnd yet now they all want to stay there for pre existing conditions so I think you're doing what really benefits people that they need healthcare a year you know your family the things you worry about our whether or not you can afford your mortgage or rent whether or not you have health care for your family I mean you know basic core issues like that we have to address so I think the more\nWe take on those issues and that helps Democrats that House Republicans that helps independence it's not like Donald Trump just trying to keep the base motivated with hate and divisiveness or we want to actually do things that benefit\nEveryone and that's what we're trying to campaign on and I think that's the single best way to convey what you're saying Chris let's not make it about fear and hate let's make it about hope and an aspirational ideas and I think healthcare education a good paying jobs and getting rid of the corruption and Washington are definitely at the very top of the list\nLinda in Deerfield Beach Florida you're on the air with cars smoking\nPot that Hi Tom thank you congressman for taking my call our\nMy question to you is and I already voted by AT T I C um November sex is recount how you know I think a lot of states aren't seeing one of them they're going to cause some shenanigans but my question to you is and I wish you would tell everybody out there like Tom Hanks conservative listeners\nIf we don't want a house in the Senate how bad it and again that's all I'm asking you to hold it out there and they know what you're voting for\nYour time Linda thank you so much for asking so you know there's a couple of friends that I'm most nervous about um one is healthcare a we know that they have done everything they can to try to take apart the Affordable CARE Act\nUh they'll figure out a way to completely dismantle it and if we lose that that means we lose\nCoverage for pre existing conditions because they can Jack the rates up to the point you won't be able to afford it so you won't have coverage if you have a pre existing condition or they will go after Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid they've already said that you know right after their tax bill Paul Ryan said a couple of weeks ago Mitch McConnell said oh my God we have to go after entitlements to forgetting title means\nIs their code for I'm saving coated the their expression for Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nWhich by the way you pay for your entire life through your pay checks on Social Security and Medicare so they will go after that Paul Ryan has always wanted to privatize Social Security get put in the hands of Wall Street you know let them have some gambling fun see how they do and Medicare put it into a voucher and then you're going to lose even more access for people who have healthcare\nThrough Medicare I mean those are a couple of issues and then I also look at war and peace issues you know watching this president and how he handled the situation in Turkey with uh the Saudi Arabian government uh when Saudi Arabia is involved and you know one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world in Yemen\nWatching them not stand up to it watching them talk tough to Iran but then cozy up to North Korea I mean there is a lot to worry about that along with trade in so many other things a lot\nIs is on the the the line with November six but I think the last thing I Would add in Joe Biden said this far more eloquently that I'm going to a yesterday when he was in Wisconsin\nEveryone knows Donald Trump\nThe question is do we know who we are a we have to express who we are as an American people so a Donald Trump may be a lot of things that many of us are not very happy with um but uh and for very very good reason\nWho are we the American people and we have a way to express that in November six and if you're not happy with the divisiveness that comes out every single day that the president seems truly enjoy putting out there or your opportunity to take care of that is on November sex\nRich in Aurora, Colorado you're on the air with cars congressman poke him\nOh thank you Tom and congressman Mark I'm for everything that you do to the parents groceries cause I'm ...

... you're here to talk because I'm not doing a very good job I got these calls and George in Santa Ana California you're on the air with congressman poke at\nOr get more enjoyment um what do I have to say is I have a lot of friends or a live down here in ... district in and we're trying to get more capping a jar over the top down here but uh it's difficult I have a lot of friends that are working class friends some of them union some of non union that\nI noticed is being influenced by a right wing hate radio and a lot of these conservative fake news websites and this you know when I think uh [noise] the proper or cautionary statement I have to them is that when you tune into these are\nA radio stations and and fake news websites you're dancing with the devil and if you dance with the devil long enough before you know it you're right in step with them a a like a response to that\nI mean you know all they have is fear right that's all they're putting out there this caravan uh yeah I've said you know there is no caravan of a transgender Nancy Pelosi supporters at the border right I mean they're combining every little bit of fear they have in the last few days trying to\nScare people into a somehow caring and not looking at what the president's done around issues like separating families and\nA tax bill or eighty three percent of the money goes to the top one percent and and the big corporations and all of the attacks on health care I mean those are that's the reality of what Republicans have done in Congress and now they're trying to run far far far away from that and scare people with all these leather\nIssues that are you and I both know are are not very real in the end and um I I think we just have to make sure people understand that uh again I think people do know what Donald Trump is about many many people\nWe need to get those folks out to vote to show who we are as a country and I think I'm Dale any effort that people could put in a knocking on doors making phone calls using their social media talking\nTo their friends and family about these issues to make sure they early vote because in many areas you can early vote right now and you should and then you can have time to help people get out on election day on Tuesday or it's going to really matter so that's what I'm focused on because I think that the more Democrats or independents we get out and fair minded Republicans who are not\nHappy with this administration and this Congress a week and have a successful Tuesday November ...\nRob in Chico, California you're on the earth scars invoking\n... more than ... than I Am I Am from progressive as you can get but I Am sincerely want to be educated on\nWhat what what the progressive says if the cause of took leadership what what is their position on immigration I'm specifically ascribe what happens when a um crosses the border at the rents are any\nUh men women and children what what is the process well what happened to them under progressive leadership\nCher I'm so Rob first of all there's a lot of fear out there right there I tell you we want to open borders no one wants open borders are right now we're actually violating international law I've been down to the dog will bridge for example in Texas where if you come to legally claim asylum there is international law that there's a process in place\nThat you can claim asylum by going through a process doesn't mean you're going to get it\nBut you have to have access to the process we currently are often violating that um I think what we would like to do is there is a two sessions ago when I first came to Congress a there is a bill not perfect but a really good place to start that was a bipartisan compromise that came out of the Senate with almost Seventy votes which is pretty much\nIn the past the sun they passed the Senate came one of them and some Democrats may have a house\nDid not take it up under John Boehner and Paul Ryan's leadership\nUh and uh because of that we've gone nowhere in six years so the problem is\nRepublicans in the house stop something going forward that would have had two things one\nExtra protections at the border so all of this talk we don't want a giant wall the cost of billions and billions but you can have and should have extra protections at the borders but also we need to have a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans who currently are here you can't neglected Thirteen million people who are undocumented currently live here we've got to figure out\nHow to deal with that and right now instead of dealing with is trying to tell you there's thirty five hundred people in the caravan who might in six weeks get to the border so we're sending troops now\nAgain in election ploy to try to deal with it the issues they're saying that were that we want to let people in to give them benefits all the rest it's so ridiculous\nThat I'm surprised anyone actually believes that Donald Trump has done a great job in a line about this telling you not to believe the media were telling you the truth uh instead just listen to Donald Trump 'cause he'll tell\nYou the people who are not ... are not eligible who are not here legally are not eligible for any of these benefits\nIt's so paying their taxes benefits but they don't get anything\nYou're being tracked on line by social

Republicans have destroyed net neutrality any our back with congressman mark Pocan Congress when you wanted to tell us the story before we pick up the next call\nYeah if I could it just it relates to what Paul that brought this kind of fear that the Republicans put out there and what the real impact is and I think sometimes you know um people don't understand the real impact people who don't live and breathe politics who don't listen to your show Tom who don't uh you know follow politics very closely I was doing door Saturday with Randy Bryce\nIn the south part of genes villain a lower\nMiddle class um neighborhood and um I went to one door and talk to the woman and I said are you planning going out to vote a week from Tuesday and she said if we're still able to live here so she's worried about being evicted 'cause they're having a hard time paying\nThe rent I talked to another woman who uh it was a lesbian couple and until I mentioned myself that my husband and I live in the western part of being county and and then she opened up a little bit what she told me was she's afraid because her and her partner or as two women living together on a government list of voting list\nUh they're afraid that point some point someone may come to get them\nUm and you know this is the fear that put out there when it's the others right it's middle Easterners its people across the border it's the transgender community it's it's all the different folks that this guy is so proud to be a national list that he sends out there very coated but all the people that he's willing to attack in through under the bus\nPeople feel it who don't follow politics and they're very very afraid and we're seeing that out there and I just want to offer that 'cause I Love doing doors 'cause I get the real conversations\nWith people who don't just think about politics or at a high level who are just worried about life but this is the things that they're actually thinking about and I you know we used to have to know that it's really even more awful I think that some of us are sometimes referred to wind down Trump does is it has a negative negative impact on real people's lives\nAre you and your husband concerned about what might happen to the Supreme Court ruled reverses old ... old burger filled\nI mean a lot of things that happen to a lot of people who've been married I mean again you know our marriage has done nothing ah you know Donald Trump is on whatever number is our number three\nNot because my husband and I hit because he's got the problem right there and ah yeah I think we need to make sure everyone realizes that but there's a lot of threats to you know couples like us to a couple in Janesville and so many other people but\nThe fact that she actually was afraid to be on a government list with her partner\nJust really you know it just really hit me because it's like that's what real people are worried about and that's what the divisiveness that this president's creating what people are feeling out in America you know\nI'm Steve in St Genevieve Missouri Steve you're on the air with congressman poking\nHey Tom Hi congressman um my question is congressman first though I live in Missouri and the marijuana a props he's going to be I think it's the third time they are going to try to go forward again in this state\nUm you were talking about the banking system earlier about uh trying to push the federal banking on him give it more to the state will\nIn the previous hour we had a guest talking about public banking yeah ...\nOh okay um is that going to actually benefit a marijuana corporate uh uh\nCompanies because I Am from my understanding right now you can't you can't deposit any of that a prop it into a FDIC account\nRight Congress and that has to do with a marijuana being classified schedule one drug right think he's right\nAnd I'll tell you Steve this is one where I'm really hopeful ah there are Republicans who also think this is a crazy notion and they're a moderate and conservative Democrats who think this is it a crazy notion that you have the legal business uh and you can't put money in a bank because of some antiquated interpretation of what\nOne is I think that's something that we can change I I haven't heard Donald Trump express that opinion one way or the other on it but I Do think it's something that you could actually see some bipartisanship happen it is an antiquated approach to something that now is it legal business in many states and I do think we can change that law\nTo Congress and we have a minute and twenty seconds I is not quite enough for a call a and but it long enough for a good ... ready for the election and go for it\nSure you know I'm so often people say this is the most important election of our lifetimes I truly honestly believe that this is Donald Trump is something I never ever expected I talked to people and they're like you could write a novel this bad and yet this is what we're living through and if if elections have consequences\nThat Wisconsin's one of those states where we had a two hundred fifty thousand democratic they'll drop out he won Wisconsin we all need to do everything we can in the remaining days\nTo one vote early and to spend time helping get out voters a it is so very important I Want our conversation next week time to be talking about all the successes we had in how progress as one in in all these interesting parts of the country and these great referendum that passed\nIt only happens if we participate in vote and I just really want to encourage everyone to do whatever you can give a little more in the next week of your time and effort and we can get this done\nIf somebody listening wants to uh you know reach out and do some phone banking from home or something where they who they call where they got what's the website I Would\nSay you'll find a candidate or I'm sure the candidates will do it most of the the Democratic Party's do in the states and local communities you can contact them groups like indivisible and move on and have great efforts or you could probably contact those as well uh I don't think there'll be a hard way to find a way to get involved\nUm but I Do that okay congressman mark ... a thanks so much for being with us that I really think you always an honor to host you here on this program Mendez argue

D\n[noise]\nMichelle Obama image focused on immigration Hi Mike moss the Justice Department\nSays investigators found that image of Michelle Obama's driver's license among the many images of suspected targets a pipe bomb suspect Caesar say oc\nThey tell a federal judge they expect to make more charges against the oc presenting more than a dozen pipe bombs to Democrats they say say begin planning the campaign back in July\nSo that they can continue supporting our survival and promote the interests of our nation so those are the two basis\nSo I I I'd like to kind of open those up and look into the where the in law were in the constitution do you find the affirmative right not to be harmed by your rubber is actually in or not for your government not to collaborate with industry or even allow industry to harm us [noise]\nYeah so the due process clauses in our constitution and um most Americans know what that means the government can't the privacy of due process or I mean as a as he writes without due process of loss of life liberty or property\nAnd there is case law that says when the government doesn't have a general duty to ensure our protection every day\nIt does have the duty not to take affirmative action and it just uh put citizens in peril\nUm and so ended that case law the planes have constructed\nI'm a very robust argument going back decades looking to government documents that show and these are all available to the public um that show that the government knew about this\nClimate threat for decades and deliberately pursued a fossil fuel policy despite knowing about this threat ah there was a shocking before that I just read a couple of days ago um it was a memo to President Nixon from one of his closest advisors\nThat outlines the dangers of climate change says the guy do something about this otherwise and this is\nAlmost a direct quote good by Washington ... to find New York we don't have any data on Seattle\nWow I Would love to see the bomb so they so that our our due process rights\nI'm I'm ... it's it's [noise] it's not I mean I I I I understand the concept but [noise] how\nDo you know due process is is is is out you know is is actually out of this idea that if you are charged with something you have access to the core it's I mean the way we find these in the\nFifth sixth seventh and eighth amendment to the constitution um the Orientals I'm misunderstanding due process itself I don't see where it's explicit that the government can't army was life liberty and the pursuit of a person to administer from the declaration of the constitution what am I missing\nProcess clauses been interpreted as we're you know two centuries by American courts and the Supreme Court [noise] and so case law has a clearly defined individual liberties\nThat are protected by the due process clause and so some of those individual liberties as many of them on that for example personal security family autonomy\nEqual protection and so these are the liberties the courts over the past two centuries\nUm and some are more modern of course has it been determined to be protected under our constitution by the due process clause that says a specific one I'm mentioning is the right to not be put in affirmative danger\nBy government is a very explicit one in the case law in other words the government doesn't have the general obligation to make us safe all the time it cannot take actions that put us into Iraq with an immediate Terrell knowing that that is the result of his actions so\nIs it that we are subsidizing the fossil fuel industry that's doing this I mean that's an aggressive action that the government is taking ... or is it simply allowing them to do what they're doing for both\nUh there was actually a whole suite of government actions that the federal government takes every day so it's not just subsidies is approving export projects and promoting those export\nThat's a huge massive quantities of fossil fuel is opening public lands to coal mining and fracking drilling is opening that President Trump this um opened up more offshore waters to oil drilling is all of those actions combined\nAnd so while the American public sometimes think that um you know life is like this are China and just for the government to add um it's actually it's actually more um trust in government from taking those affirmative actions on a daily basis that put us on in danger so\nThat's the that's the due process argument the other argument is the author of government as essentially holding our environment and trust can you explain that\nYeah this goes back to as it's called an attribute of solving it actually goes back to ... times Institute says just staying in the public trust has reflections in legal systems all around the world and it's just a very basic premise that says those can easily understand\nThat one of those purchases of government is to protect the natural resources\nThat society ally of the time and not protected strictest one generation or act or allow one generation to exploit those resources rather protect it isn't and down and for future generations\nWhich you know by the way I always coming into the present every time that the ... and that was a future coming into the president\nAnd so protected isn't in down and said that they're catching me endure\nThe founders of this country created the constitution I'm On the platform as the ... well no concept in England it was um\nIt was important to our law at a very early days in this country one of the ... cases of Illinois Central railroad which was Eighteen Ninety two was actually present in our legal for so long before that and so the premises\nGovernment has to protect the resources we rely on for our survival of the nation can enjoy the founders didn't create the constitution as a suicide attack\nSo for for somebody who is not schools in the law and has tried to understand what we're talking about can you give me an example of a time I mean is this you know Teddy Roosevelt in the national parks I mean when the government said okay we're going to act proactively\nTo to uh to to\nOn on behalf of the public ... you know as a trustee of the ... of of the name of the environment of nature\nWill typically it's typically if the courts enforcing the public trust in government because government is typically inclined to use its power for the benefit of private industry\nAnd it's a great example is that Illinois Central case that I mentioned and that was the case on that arose when the Illinois legislature conveyed the entire Chicago waterfront to railroad company\nAnd the citizens back then and they can and you needed that water fishing and navigation and commerce and if in court in a an opinion that is still the landmark opinion of this as the fiscal said he can't get at this and there are certain resources um including these\nShort short friends that are held in trust held in public trust\nAnd the legislature literally has no power to just give them away I'm the only time it can give them away as if it really promotes the trip says of the public trust and does not do substantial impediment to the remaining resources\nSo government what what the government's doing today is actually I repeat as Illinois Central I'm In the atmosphere is sort of giving wells giving away public resources fossil fuel resources that are severely\nNine months\nVery what you're doing God's work I Do I Hope we can have can continue this conversation time goes on the fact we didn't even have a I'm Sorry we're hitting

possible\nOr if it's\nThere you go and he's the author of the vampire trilogy the silently series which portrays fictional stories of real vampires uh this author an expert on vampires Douglas Robison Douglas welcome to the program\nThank you sir for having me so are you a vampire no\nTell me about vampires\nWell when I say a vampire there's a whole range of of behaviors that human blood drank curves on a call ... people and so forth but ah I use them periodic to describe people that are physically change to have to drink blood delay of\nOkay and you think that such people exist yes\nI Know that there is a a genetic\nAbnormality that happens in some people where they have to have a basically massive amounts of iron\nOr in their diet or they they get anemic and they get very very sick and uh those people historically drank animal blood as you know or and ate a lot of meat particularly organ meats that are rich in blood as part of their diet just to keep from getting anemic\n... is it possible that is what you're talking about her that that's the source of the vampire legend or do you think this is something beyond a you know the biology\nA like a ... had these people\nMost of my life and I've prayed for the most of my life and salt to understand but like in Nineteen Ninety three I Believe it was a sole something\nUh I assume totally took a little fiction writing class at some are not so what would be the essence of sixteen novel link stories of specifically about a ... girl ... making and at the time her relationship with a young man named Thomas\nNow in the beginning commerce does her what she really is but he finds out in the first story what she really is\nA it really goes a lot deeper than this condition or that condition and introducing you in the second story rites of passage to the human blood drinkers because there are also you know the devil is head people out there from the beginning\nWhether they drink blood ritual in your ceremonial tea or like just like hurt people or whatever\nA show to bigger a tapestry of of reasons and things and when you're a\nPhysics easier and easier here talking about novels after taking a a a fiction writing course that's a very different thing than saying yes I I Know this is true I've met these people are where I have some evidence that they're out there um [noise] do you have any I don't\nKnow about what I Know about the mostly comes from the key character in this story that you were a plant is right now that's the best that I can give you\nYeah so then basically what you're saying as the ... and do you believe that vampires exist or or didn't do did you want to just promote your novels\nNo the physically change blood drinkers that I write about in my story do exist on leave\nHow oh okay so what causes you to believe that\n[noise] well like I say I pray for him for a long time the lord gave me a couple of scriptures regarding them and I can't say how I Know what I Know I just know what I Know\nSo what does the ... what have you said you've ... you've prayed for them what does the Bible say above emperors or vampire ...\nLet me just right off a couple of scripture for you to jot down and look at the lighter fare okay there's Joe ... to\nWhich says what a whole ... let me just give it a list quickly well no I won't do any good because nobody's going to be writing this down while they're listening to the radio and if we just you know this site a bunch of scripture uh people are just going to turn off the radio I mean what does that anybody would say at home about vampires\nOK Joel two verse to die of darkness in of gloom in a day of clouds of ... those specific aspects ... as as I explained it is how the ... condition manifests\n... zone like white\nWell I don't mean so
