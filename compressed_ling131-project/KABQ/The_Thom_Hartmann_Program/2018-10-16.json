smoke marijuana and um you know um other types of freedom of expression see that people throw this libertarianism idea around so much and it sounds sexy on the surface there is a political access\nAnd libertarianism is the bottom so did you say that libertarian is libertarianism is sexy [laughter] I didn't hear it it is to a lot of to a lot of voters right that that's for a lot of these so called Trump voters come from there there are people\nWho got fed up with not I'm seeing people do anything for them economically so they were aggressive this idea that they need to\nYou know withdraw from society and Trump offered them something like that so let me get to this so you have an access economic left right\nTo ... on the top which is ... ... police steak total control that's like styling is on the left it's like selling U.S Russia add to the right it's like Adolf Hitler and a Mussolini fascism\nOn the bottom and just no government right like candy is like you know a minimalist government but he's economic to the left and then you've got the Koch brothers are in the Koch brothers economic to the right it's just a you know I'm a political science er and I'm probably getting way into the weeds for people but if you ever take the political compass tested actually\nPlots all this stuff out Bernie actually is more towards the middle of the acts as a balance between where governments in the middle\nI'm he's slightly towards libertarian side slightly to the left is not as part of the left when you put them on his policies he's further left in a lot of other people but I've taken this test and I'm way further to the left and burning wants to take the political\nAccomplished ask here's the problem that I have when when talking about libertarianism and civil law and\nPolitical let me just say libertarianism as a term as a political term is about ... ... is about government's role and it's the opposite up to ...\nI understand that but it talking twenty Eighteen I'm not saying that I'm a libertarian by the way I'm a I'm a I'm a left his socialist about where we're going to have to carve out a whole 'nother hour if we want to get into the the political views of Bob writer here's the problem that I have libertarianism the way that it's being sold these days especially on the economic right\nIs being sold as a way of getting government out of your business getting government regulations off and that's going to let the free market flourish and from their\nJobs are going to rain down from the sky and wages are going to go through the roof and and all of our problem in itself is on that's the problem is it it's all nonsense correct because\nIt just so happens that every single policy that's being proposed by these quote unquote libertarian Institute's\nAlso happen to put more money into the pocket of a very few people I have a very ...\nSo here's where I think government needs to be they need to be a lot of places they need to be the social safety net they need to be protecting people they need to be do they need to do things like equalize the power between government or between business and um the working class\nThe people that were government doesn't need to be is a policing some of the civil liberties right things like that but that's not what the people that's not what libertarians on the economic right what\nThey want they want they want to do exist there only concerned about government regulation as it pertains to them making money that's got that's where the government needs to be as protecting everyday citizens and that's that's that goes back to um Franklin Delano Roosevelt that goes back to the great society the Nineteen sixties\nThe Koch brothers and people like that their political Charlotte's ends there were aggressive Republicans they need to get out of politics\nWell let's talk a little bit about um the Koch brothers and their libertarian history\nOr because David Koch ran for president in Nineteen eighty as a libertarian candidate um and this is where a lot of their um you know they they they sought to change the government from the inside that point you can look it up the the Nineteen eighty libertarian platform that he was trying to promote\nUm you know and it was a getting rid of any kind of a worker um regulations like minimum wage child labor laws or any sort of environmental protections like a ... you know prohibiting what you can dump into a river because other countries like China we hear it again\nHere's here's what I say to these people that take their platforms right to labor part of it if they want to take away all those protections than take the handcuffs off the labor movement and no rules on us because the only reason the reason why we've got the national labor relations act is because\nThey were putting antitrust regulations on the top of top of us so you want to know what the Koch brothers don't want any rules I don't want any rules either that\nYou might actually be a libertarian the you said I can go that you weren't but after something like that it's hard to it's hard to say maybe here here's\nHere's here's one here's what I Know I'm a I'll also wants to get rid of child labor laws no Rhode Island is what I Want what I Want is to for the hip hypocrisy the end\nThey don't want to be regulated but they want us to be regulated right isn't that means that there's been a series was first it started in the Eighteen hundreds in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds to start taking down the power labor than we equalize it in Nineteen thirty six of the passes National Labor Relations Act\nAnd then they come back in Nineteen forty seven and they tried to kneecap us with this law called Taft Hartley well screw them\nPeople like the Koch brothers they want they they want their ... that's what this is all about in terms of what they've been doing they want to have everything they want to run the table on the American worker and people need to wake up and realize\nAbout that is just a perfect place I think we're going to have to leave it for now before we jump off I Want to thank our guests today we had a brain strike are from a algae holding we

N. N. words don't really\nWork a cording to Fox News this was published last week\nWhile it isn't that uncommon for couples to have unspoken rules to ensure a happy relationship one woman has taken it to the extreme by drafting a lengthy contracts detailing twenty two requirements for her boyfriend to sign now this is actually rings a bell for people who've been paying attention\nTo libertarian drama I Know that uh the the show on L. are indata them prior to us something called a freedom has a segment on their show every week called libertarian drama of the week\nThere is a I'm not going to name names 'cause there's there's no point but there's a celebrity ... let's let's say a who at one point was outed for having a relationship agreement a written contract with his girlfriend that was also similarly restrictive so I Want to make it clear\nThis contract the super controlling contract you're about to hear isn't\nNecessarily something just a woman would do right like I come from from either side the list was first shared on Twitter by a guy who found it in a used car he had purchased but he didn't deleted it kind of car doesn't say here at least in the story\nOr maybe the daily mirror has that 'cause they also talked about it\n[noise] I'll pull that up anyway uh he says he later deleted it because people thought it was his own girlfriend who had made it and she was being harassed according to the daily mirror the list has sensory surface after board panda shared images of it\nAlong with comments from horrified readers now some of this um will probably have to be censored a little bit here but we're just going to go down the list and tell me if you know any um any people like this in a relationship any any controlling\nPsychopaths or maybe you think these are reasonable rules so I mean feel free to lead to weigh in here rule number one again these are the rules\nFor the boyfriend alright so uh I don't think that the the girlfriend is being restricted by any ... any of these rules at least not in the the ones that I've I've looked at your cell phone\nNumber one you know again the word not never ever and rarely these words appear in all capital letters everything else not if it's properly ... capitalized you are not to have a single girl's phone number\nWhat about a married girl small number you know what\nThey're there's two ways you could interpret this right it could be you cannot have a single girl's phone number like as in she's single or you cannot have a single girl's number maybe I can have one not to have\nYou cannot have the phone number of any female including your mother your grandmother your aunt your co worker that you have to talk to\nGrandma considered a girl I mean girls kind of ... typically like a younger kind of a terminology I mean it just depends on how it's there are people that use the term girl to describe any woman true you're like you could say hey girls and you could be talking about a a group of ...\nOf older women right because the Golden Girls yeah great point a so number two you are not to follow them presumably the single girls or or any girls on social media including Instagram Snapchat and Twitter\nWhich means she will be auditing your social media to make sure that you're not following them\nNumber three you are not to hang out with Kagan\nNow apparently that is a males name although I've heard Keegan as a female they only Kagan that I Am aware of is a an actor Keegan Michael key here what half of key and Peele\nHeat I think it was like a cool guy to hang out with and hang out with him and says you're in parentheses including his house or anywhere public well I don't know where he lives a maybe we'll be\nAt the same state at the same time I don't know now I don't know what this one is a number for you are not to go to Honda without me\nNow I'm not sure if that's like a race track or something like that or like 'cause like why wouldn't you be able to go to the dealership kind of left out there with you maybe there's acute girl networks that down to dealerships I'm not ...\nMaybe one of those cute single girls that he was following on Twitter and ends to filter number five you are not to hang out with your friends more than two times per week\nI mean without her or just in general\nThat's a good question she doesn't make it clear I Would imagine that if it was with her she\nCould wave you know she could wave the rule or some of the I'm going to get this has to do with or\nWithout her right 'cause you know some some couples they need to have a little bit of alone time they might have their their friend time or whatever so she's saying no more than twice a week\nYou are not to look at a single girl\nTo look at a single girl [laughter]\nRight so and I've had this discussion with other people about some of these you know really restrictive of don't look at women\n... well what if I'm at a restaurant and she's asking to take my order do I'd

know what it was but it\nLed us to discuss the issue of left versus right libertarianism and honestly this isn't something that comes up to two often here on free talk loud because I don't know\nThat we have many if any hosts until now with Jackie here who have described themselves as either right or left libertarian and during the break we were kind of I asked the question\nWhat are the other issues because we were talking about property rights right now and how there's a difference between the purported left and right libertarians on how they view property rights\nBut I was wondering are there any other issues on which left libertarians in so called right libertarians differ from normal libertarians or whatever\nAnd a sense do you identify a correct me if I'm wrong I don't identify as a write libertarian or left libertarian to vie to associate with a good many people that describe themselves as less libertarian and it seems to me that the only difference\nIs a different view about property\nAnd when you say property do you mean um and just may be a question for you Jackie do you mean land\nOr do you mean lately a car state okay so not like the car that you drive or is it the toothbrush you're just one of the questions that I've had of All right so if we abolished property do I keep my old under ...\nAnd do I have my own bed or do I just you know one day come home and somebody has my under pads and is laying on my bed and I don't want them there\nSo so that brings up a good question about what can be property what can what can you own who can own it what rights to property rights conveys so there's personal property like your teeth brushing your underwear there's land natural resources et cetera\nEven with land there's questions of like you know how high up how far down doesn't share of the water doesn't\nEither wildlife and arguing about for a long\nYes and then there's also you know can you know and people okay can you own your children can you own an idea a and M. and talking about who can on what I'm\nThere without a difference between sort of interrupt that if you you mentioned children and there's definitely a schism within the uh let's say the liberty movement here in New Hampshire between the people who believe they own their children and the people who believe their children are independent individuals who can make choices on their own is that a left right difference\nI haven't seen that discuss the primary the primary tide waves I've seen less libertarianism uses the English from other forms libertarianism is um property okay property issues and then a specifically to land and then also sometimes people use it to mean that they prioritize um social issues\nThat social issue assets of libertarianism so they're more into what will be on your own body yeah\nYeah and I and some people use it to me that that's what they're prioritizing but the big fundamental philosophical differences about the right to own land okay do we all morally own ears in common or can people you know legitimately own land\nPrivately and just have private profits profit from it and not all the rest of society anything for that and\nTo some days it oh go ahead and going\nOut there talking about in yeah I'm so relatively recently I've been kind of I Would say almost I hate to use this over used her red tailed on the idea of property being kind of a construct of the a\n... of the state kind of a human construct does not inherit and I think it can exist a morally I mean you you pay for something and you have a receipt yeah you just use nobody should take it from you\nBut beyond that it's kind of in agreement that enforced or the state monopoly or forced a so called ... or whatever just given this court\nOr that's appropriate but yeah the so called the claim monopoly on force and then without without that the idea that you have a hair or\nRight over our property or you know large large you know they say or a car trucker capital what you'd call it capital good lately land without your\nPresence and use of that land that you just have some kind of an hair right because of your name on a piece of paper I mean that's always been a construct and forced\nBy the state so in a state stateless a market based society it's not that it sounds radical\nSocialist as so many people which is why so many people libertarian even anarchists react so negatively to this idea but I mean\nTo the idea of that you have to actually do something with property in order to have a valid claim over is that what the ideas you're talking about\nYeah well there are normative a property right that we have at our current society really don't apply to a market based stateless society you know ... and I don't think they do\nOne reason that I Am not ... not an anarchist as I Do believe the Antarctica communist have a much more realistic vision of what would happen to property rights without a state\nIf you're a landlord and you're on five different houses and you know five different places around the country and tomorrow morning we wake up and there's no government\nYou are at best collecting rent on one of those and everybody else is going to be like I occupied this house I'm not paying rent anymore you may want to hire a private enforcer to collect rent for you but it's worth more to the people living in that house to pay them off then it's going to be worth it for you to pay them to try\nBut you're right we're not there yet\nAnd that that's why yeah you can be a libertarian can believe\nWhatever other facet of the world you would like to believe but if if you weren't actually act on those in the current situation you would be imposing those beliefs of the other individuals who may not believe it\nSo and in fact you were going against libertarian\n[noise] well I mean if I if I just simply act on my beliefs I'm not imposing minimum anybody but if you are taking over the government then you are imposing\nThe government leaving people alone I mean ideally if libertarians get their way they want to have the government to lead people alone but yes you would impose the government leaving people alone on people if you can say that but I guess no matter\nWhat I was saying is the so and the current situation where you have a federal government\nIf you're in the law say you're a left or right if you impose a left leaning law\nAnd the current situation than your imposing on everybody not just yourself and you're so right away they currently are if you go either way and then you're kind of going against your your libertarian but wait because\nWell yeah I mean if the law is designed to control others then you're definitely imposing upon the rights of others but if the loss is to say strike a bunch of laws off the books like if you know if a\nHand there there are people that uh you know miss understand libertarianism that would say you're that imposing your views on other people right technically\nYou are you're imposing your view that people should be left alone by this concept known as the state\nUm it but it's not the same thing is imposing your view with violence not in the hearts of rating people for possessing a plaid is not imposing anything on anyone yeah if if a let's say you know you're not probably not going to get elected this time around the world but if you were to get elected as a state rep er here this November and\nPut in a bill to just strike prohibitions out of the uh you know the criminal statutes here in New Hampshire just write them wholesale out of their um no with no regulation with no you know a taxation right and they're just strike\nAbout just off and then add the sentence because unfortunately we would need to add a sentence or to say that it accordance with the controlled substances act fill in the blank is not one ... yes\nSo if you were to strike a bunch of stuff out ... that's not really the same thing as imposing something on someone by force right there\nIn this point if you want to if you still are a drug prohibition is you can still choose not to do drugs and you can still tell people to not do drugs or whatever if you just can't use the guns or the government to force people to do that so I mean it's a strange\nWay to say that that's imposing on somebody but I guess you could write will make better it's\nThe same way that you know if I'm On a diet and someone's eating a brownie they're violating my diet but they're not following like that the conservatives do this all the time of your marriage violates my religion\nOkay well I'm not in your religion\nRight but it's the same thing about you know you ate a brownie that I Can't eat because of my diet strict razor other comments go ahead\nI'm Sorry that was pretty much a\nThanks man I appreciate hearing from you tonight are told free number if you joined us here eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom let's talk to Ben is in Texas bend you're on TALK live listening online\nGuys then later a libertarian candidate for president this question is for Jackie may in their area through my favorite Robert\nI'm supposed to talk about property rights of a different time uh lately there's been a lot of discussion about Facebook perch and there's yeah discussion private company\nWell I'm curious and something I've been pushing or is using activist investor techniques because when we own a private company will now or owners coat on private company in private company\nAnd we can show up to their annual share meeting and I know a hundred percent Darryl periods of on the war at convention I Would love to see Darryl Perry and other libertarians on the floor at the annual shareholder meetings or Facebook Twitter and so forth\nWhen things why would I Want to go to a Facebook or Twitter shareholders meeting\nTo stand up for the principles that you believe in\nI've definitely heard of people doing this form of activism before when they buy like a minimum number of shares in that company so that they have a right to enter the meetings and speak I don't know a lot about the history of success rate of it and I'm thinking if people got very far with it they would probably\nCome up with some meeting rules to block it down but it sounds like a more of an expert on it do you know more about how successful it's been in past instances Wisconsin\nHad done this\nHave you done this\nI I have not done it but as best\nAdvocate what other people do if you yourself have never been willing to do it\nI I just found out about it recently and I'll give you the there will be anti gun lobby\nHas been doing this with companies like storm Ruger and they'll buy minimal numbers shares like Jackie said and they will show up\nAnd they advocate or adopt policies that are actually not in favor of the company's interest but are in favor of the gun laws so if the enemies or freedom can employ these tactics why can't we employ these\nThe enemies of freedom also wind up throwing a you know like manhole covers through storefront windows\nIs the I'm Sorry but this to me it just seems like such a pointless task and so ... I'm ed how turned out to hold it\nSo he had we've attempted to do something similar to this not with Twitter non when based on what you're talking about the thing we can't talk about the thing that we can't talk about that as a small business here that has something kind of like shareholder meetings and we show up and just get out voted\n... yeah okay I understand that if there's only one person instead of a concentrated effort of a dozen\nPeople are but what you're talking about here is different okay Darryl the thing you're talking about it again I don't want to get into details on this 'cause we're not supposed to talk about it and I wish we wouldn't even gone too far but regardless\nYou're talking about a organization that is fully owned by its it the people and they remember all the that's completely different than what the caller here Ben is talking about which is to say you're then buying shares in a corporation [noise]\nMost of these corporations are set up to where somebody's got control of fifty one percent of them so therefore you're going to leave the the uh right so therefore your votes are ultimately a completely futile waste of time\nOr if you were to actually go to one of these meetings or whatever if they even have a you know a physical meeting that you can go to instead of just oh you can vote on who are board members are or online or in some other process but stand by then it finally continue the discussion here you can do for a number eight fifty five four fifty for\nUm ... much talk about down home values\nLate in the usa blue jeans do more as a kid I remember\nWhere they may move\n\n\nVoted down and cry\n\nI'm In a\nNoodle version comfort dime a dozen genes every students guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle gene guns get reinforced and see them a G.

I don't I mean it may go ahead Ben I'm\nSome kind of magic but I can stay within the last year these tactics were effectively employed at a store rigor were company\nAt one of their shareholder meeting\nBy it started off a Ruger not storm river can you worked for them but I work for a contractor for them\nSo so then well I personally am skeptical about how effective it is a tactic would be I don't want to be somebody who discourages you know people from trying out different forms of activism\nYet and you can waste it however you want\nWell everybody has different interests and different talents and so if this is your interest you know try it come back to us let us know how it works and if it is working for you know left wing on gun rights opponents maybe we can make it work for us\nOr maybe it's something where you know they wise up and start throwing people out of the meetings that please do to try using it for libertarian ends and let the rest of us know how well that works because I'm very curious and I'm always looking for new ways to you know attack creepy and authoritarianism in the world now\nGetting out of the event is nothing new or a libertarian oh I expect shot\nAnd are you referring just to be clear you mentioned sturm Ruger um I found an article here from looks like earlier this year May of twenty Eighteen a sturm Ruger shareholders approve proposal for gun maker to report on risks of its business is that the story you're talking about where it's the northwest coalition\nFor responsible investment\nHas ... ... that sounds similar to what I'm Talking about and I'm like I'm\nI'm we're going to talk about that story coming up here in a moment 'cause you know it's one thing to just say hey this thing work door you heard this thing work we're going to dig in a little deeper and see exactly what it was that purportedly happened Byron\nBut it's\nNot well here's the problem okay so like I said people can do whatever they want you know if you are if you like having a hobby that ah you know involves watching wrestling or football or singing karaoke or whatever it is you know we all have time that we passed until we finally die right so we can choose the way we do that\nUm some things are more effective than others and to me if there's a company that's doing a thing that I don't like\n'em for me my time is much better spent actually building an alternative to that company\nA rather than begging pleading and trying to take over from the inside that company I Am not interested in changing Facebook and how they behave\nI'm much more interested in going somewhere else and either finding an existing alternative and supporting that existing alternative like let's say the mastodon platform which has de centralized by the way ... just showed up on the libertarian\nToday he saw the former co hosts you're on TALK live you saw my plug mastodon on my appearance on Artie should upgrade and account\nAnd it looks like he's like and it's so far so why would I Want to go spend a bunch of time changing Facebook this ... this corporate ... him is that by all the evidence is evil and you're certainly not going to stop them from interacting with the government or in the way that they do no matter how much effort you put into it\nWhen I could just spend my time going and signing up on delivered on server at liberty on dot com and create my own account there and start promoting that and said why why bother\nWell that's that's up to each of us but I'm the guy you know what let's use every tool in the tool chest\nAnd just let

even if you are a Russell brick fan and you've been following the case you're gonna learn stuff\nIf you watch this video there there are gathering information from various different sources uh you know real legit sources court documents police investigated files\nAnd I mean we followed it closely around right talk live and I've already you know twenty five minutes in to what his will ultimately gonna be a six part documentary uh I learned some stuff you know I I Will probably wait for all of it you know allows and then watch it all at once\nYou don't miss it free rushed out or is there you can check that out All right so we're gonna continue with your calls and thoughts here let's go to a gene a Christian and are just going to give them a second uh second shot gene you're on TALK left\nHi guys and yes that includes Jackie as well because it's new to gender term I'm just wanted to talk about the latest ... uh well it's not the latest but it's another way that the government is snooping on us and uh\nYou know I told you in the past that I liked to fly and have fun when I Do it\nBut as I've twenty twenty something is coming around in the aviation community that's a they've been pushing this for over four years now and it's called ADS be now abs be means automatic dependence surveillance broadcast\nSo what it is up until now if I flew mayor playing around and I'm In an area close to a major airport I have to have something in my airplane called the trans ponder ... is very old technology it goes back like thirty or forty years\nAnd all it is is basically whenever the radar hits you you know because they have the uh at those large airports they have their big radar\nAntenna spinning around and it's writing for all traffic in the area okay so when that hits you your aircraft and sends a paying back which identifies you according to a number that you type into this device\nNow normally people like me that are just flying around me up our we put in twelve hundred so twelve hundred means I'm a V. F. R. airplane I'm not flying I F R I\nVA R. and R. dot V. as far as visual I as far as an instrument or\nInstrument correct so fine around all I Would ever have to do is put twelve hundred I can go fly around wherever I Want to pretty much as long as I stay away from the big airplanes a big airports in the what the ... class being classy airspace but that's getting to technical\nYou can't walk over military bases Kenya\nUm you generally ... not where it's not where you have a controlled surface there are a military operation areas that you can fly over a but usually you have to be your uh you don't have to tell them you're going to be there and some of those areas unless they're restricted\nBut you do have to uh be aware that there's a high speed traffic and training and the helicopters and stuff\nSo you have to go to area fifty when I was thinking you\nCannot go to area fifty one that's a restricted area\nGot it I'd also doesn't exist right ah [laughter] what were you talking about the study like go ahead\nDo the the new ... the new surveillance system that's coming out in twenty twenty is called ADS being now ADS be is going to be an active\nUh system whereas a this was a currently just a passive system that responds to a radar paying mhm so aid ESP is going to be active where your aircraft has to be equipped with instrumentation that\nTells you your GPS position to the air traffic control at all times now this is required everywhere that currently requires a transplant or so there's only going to be a small portion of airspace left in the country after twenty twenty\nThat you can fly and not have this aid ESP atheist we identify as your aircraft it identifies your altitude it identifies your position a vital really invasive\nIt says snooping system that will guarantee that wherever you are they will know what you're doing\nAll right we continue here you can bring up what she wants a we did have somebody in the discord lines I Do want to say when you call a sun discord you do need to have your microphone on muted and if you're new to discord that I don't know if it's like the default 'cause I see it happen a lot I see it happening where people will join those channels\nAnd their bikes are made it so we can't put you on a few minutes to make sure you get your settings straight usually we check with you in advance\nI'm so we'll we'll do our best to do that\nAt the beginning of the show we started an article from ah it's actually appeared in a lot of places the daily mirror Fox News bored panda\nApparently board panda was the original Scherer after a guy on Twitter had originally shared a document that he claims to have discovered in the car that he bought at a car dealer so used car yup now that he purchased and it is a reported relationship agreements\nAnd we have the twenty two rules that apply in this particular person's relationship\nWe went through the first six I'll just go through real fast here or you're not to have a single girl's phone number you not to follow them on any social media you're not to hang out with Keegan wherever that is you're not to go to a Honda without me you're not to hang out with your friends more than two times a week and we left off a number six that you are not\nAnd the Nasr in all caps and some are underlined apparently in the original document yeah I'm looking at a text version we always know underlined or you or not to look at a single girl\nNow that was already on the list no it was you or not to have a single girl's phone number\nThat was real number one this is rule number six as I mentioned earlier you it already and that's why it all down there a limit our fond of saying we left off on this because we weren't I don't think we're done at least I wasn't done talking about this\nUm I Do 'cause earlier we weren't sure when it said you're not to have a single girl stone number it's not clear as to whether or not that is the phone number of a single girl meaning a girl who does not have a relationship at the time colonel or\nYou're not to have a phone number of any single girl meaning like no women right whatsoever you should not have their phone number including your mother or grandmother or whatever\nAnd I feel like number six you are not to look at a single girl you want to know whether or not a girl is single by simply looking at her so therefore this must mean you cannot look at any other women right that's what this this rule it I don't\nThink there is necessarily a lot of logic incoherent involved in making this list\nYou don't think she uh checked it twice now she headed out\nDoesn't read like somebody who really thought through the uh you know how it pious than the implications\nRight because you know as I mentioned or ask when you read this earlier because I Know it sounded familiar [noise] uh what happens when you go to Applebee's and the person taking your order is ... you're\nNot allowed to look at the waivers [laughter] uh you you can't get like ... you can't drive the guys you know there might be a woman walking down the sidewalk\nRight well you just not supposed to look at her Daryl so you just cannot move your eyes in the direction of the one you can peripherally vision you can see it 'cause it's not the same as looking at a thing right like I'm looking at you right now Jackie's in the room I Know in my peripheral vision where she is but I'm very ends\nRight so yeah I ... if they're\nFemale that I've been just close your eyes and the hope they move out of the way up the car\n[noise] uh yeah but you know this rule isn't unfamiliar I think to a lot of guys out there right rule where the girl gets jealous and to me this is a deal breaker if any girl tries to tell me in a relationship that I'm not allowed to look at another girl\nShe's not the right girl for me right uh because one of the things I've always enjoyed with my girlfriends in the past is enjoying looking at other women like it's kind of a fun thing to do 'cause usually your girlfriend can also appreciate you know another good looking when women so the idea that you know you should somehow be prohibited from looking at\nIs like right most controlling obsessive kind of gives you only have I for me\nIn well Daryl I mean you're an attractive man but\nAnyway uh let's go on number seven if girls come up to you at any place or any time you are to walk away walking all cash prize she\nDidn't say Ryan [laughter]\nI mean does this person and not have a job with female coworkers\nWhat we do not work we don't know anything about this uh this person but yes that would make difficult it would make it very difficult to have female co workers there or being approached by you know or being the barista\nAt Starbucks [laughter] sorry girl and the yoga pat I Can't look at your talk or take your order just go hide in the corner a number eight\n... is not a not ... is to not hang out with us every time we hang out there not clear from it was a male or female number nine you are nuts to ask for age hyping Hi Cindy now I Wonder if Fox censored that let's see here I'm going to blow up the daily\nIt looks like it's an age two letters in a day so I'm pretty sure it's probably gaffe yeah\nUh but I just wanted to see here if it's actually ... a hyphenated in the original I've pulled pulled up the original scanned list here you are not noticed not censored in the original\nOkay so you're not to ask her for that I presume see me right\nYou're not to ask her for that you already can't approach and the other right and you already hadn't talked to any woman who say I would like a large ... Tito\nSo I guess you're just supposed to hope that she feels like you know dishing that out if you're in good and follow it all the rules number ten you are not to get mad at me about a single thing ever again\nOkay well I wait until they compound and then you get mad at her about a bunch of ... ... yeah you can't get mad about single things need to get mad about\nA list you are not to bring up Tyler Noah Devin or Josh ever again you sound like friends of his that he has been banned from via hanging out with which she previously says\nYou don't get the hang out with your friends your way out of their color for and it was the rule is number five you're not to hang out with your friends more than two times a week but this group of friends that that should be brought up\nAnd then there's another person that specifically mention the key again there's somebody there ... right\nRight right can hang out with Kagan at all yeah anywhere uh over twelve you are not allowed to drink unless I'm with you\nKnow I I guess things she means that alcohol because otherwise ... five yeah I think she means alcohol on that one um and maybe he's an alcoholic you know maybe this is written out of concern for his well being that could be a possibility or what they were\nEver met at a meetings\nAnd alcoholics go to meetings right is the end she could be worried that if he's drinking he will be more likely to violate the other rules by approaching indoor talking to a women right number Thirteen I Am allowed to do a phone check when ever I please\nSo I got there is found in looking as messages that one of ... could be or do you have a phone call at any time but I think you're probably more likely in our late ...\nI'm going to check your luggage I'm going to look at all your picks yeah [noise] the downloaded photo why do you have a picture of this girl [noise] I mean there are people allied L. Y. everything alcoholic at one writer during [laughter] we're coming up here and got a few\nMore of these rules to go through you can weigh in if you've had an experience like this in your

Kate's CNN is reporting that Saudi Arabia will acknowledge that missing journalist was accidentally killed during an interrogation correspondent Elise lab at\nYeah and it's like I could understand if it's like a married couple and their children and they're trying to make it work because they have kids together and there's like a history of this lady in there you know going and counseling and rebuilding trust but in any other normal relationship if you're demanding to like randomly check up\nOn your partner like that\nYou know you should go get therapy or there's some history there that means that this is not a working relationship\nThere's a few more rules here if we move in she says I think she means in together there are two never ever be girls at our house\nNow looking at the uh the purported original of this document I had started with the Fox news version this is the uh the daily mirror and they actually have a photograph of what is reported the original document that was found in a car at a used car dealership when our and bought the car\nAnd so I can now see all the underlined words and apparently there's additions or agenda is if you will sort of written into the sides of some of these so then All right uh this one says no no next to it\nAnd like earlier on when there's the rule about not asking for a for head of that one says naughty naughty\nWritten next to it anyway going on here now we don't know if the ... were added by one of the parties or by the person that found best in the car\nPurportedly it I'm going to guess that it was the girl because it's done in pink ten and a lot of cases or purple pen\nAre um there's like different colors so it's a very girlie kind of thing to to use different colors right do you use any kind of pink color would be a girly indicator right but to use multiple colors the way the writing as it looks fairly All right and they were going on here if we move in together\nYour friends will rarely be allowed over with rarely capitalized and underline\nSo she really does not want this guy to spend much time at all with his friends there was a provisions earlier about specific friends he's not ever to talk to at all the others provisions earlier about you cannot hang out with the friends you're allowed to hang out with more than twice a week and just in general if we move in together she says your friends will rarely be allowed over\nShe says further number put another point here if I catch you around girls\nI kill you that's underlined with a smiley face next to it and then later on see he's joking but yeah there's a smiley face I'm not actually going to kill your ha ha ha yes I Am just\nGoing to make you long for death and then ... then written next to that in underlined it says sorry buster going on since you are you are not to ditch me for your friends\nKnow their one Austin does not control when I hang out with you\nThat's in all caps there are never she adds in in handwriting next to it so I presume again that's another friend of his Austin\nOr maybe they live in Austin and she thought that you know like the city council was going to pass as zoning ordinance herself a going on uh we are to go on a legit dates underlined once every two weeks at least [noise]\nAll right let's you know some couples feel like they need to keep the the flame alive so to speak out on on a date but if it's obligated\nThen it's not really the same rightly right you're doing it out of obligation versus oh I'd like to invite my girlfriend out to something because it right I shall or it's an occasion of some sort of know instead it's just at least every two weeks we have to do this at a minimum\nYeah a kind of takes the fun out of it kind of takes the you know it creates expectations that are

Johnny ...\nI'm just I'm going after a Democrat who said something\nNo there's no doubt favorite thing is to pick on on women and protect you know and it's a two old ... for\nMe the one that didn't\nMatch waters is not stirring up left wing violence nobody has an avid anybody\nOr shot anybody or put snipers on a rough because anything that Maxine Waters did or said this is not about Maxine Waters I'm I'm I'm just you know\nAsking out loud Dave do we is there any way that we can agree that that there's there's\nOr or is it just is this just intrinsically is is this just the nature of of ah you know right wing ideology that it is essentially authoritarian and paternalistic and are patriarchal and and as a consequence of that violence typically comes along with it is that the deal\nNo I don't think so then why is it happening I think it is does make a true\nOn asking you why is it happening because if we can figure out why and then we can do something about it\nWhere do you think it's happening\nI think it's happening because right wing ideology tends to be authoritarian it tends to be top down and tends to be you know high all Hitler it tends to be serious or\nAnd and that kind of an ideology typically justifies violence far more easily than left wing ideology you know ah ah I'm forgetting his name the professor from Berkeley\nYou know he said basically that the conservative me of how society should be structured is as an authoritarian family with a strict father whereas the the liberal me of how society should be structured is as a family the functions you know cooperatively in collaboratively\nAnd I I see that difference in the politics I see that difference in the behavior and it concerns me that that you know that that strong father figure means oh he's got a gun he's willing to kill somebody\nWell you mentioned the Ohio Hitler Hitler was the uh he started the Nazi Party I give you the national socialist party that's hardly right wing and uh I'm astounded\n... things that they're not is where the right wing of the day or\nFor that matter that they are the right wing or as of today I mean you know that that there there are rising again in Germany they called themselves the the rights the all right and the far right\nBoiling whatever they want to certainly not the the behavior patterns that they seem to be the opening\nAnd again I bring it back to Portland, Oregon uh the the ... that I've seen are these maps weakens running people try to keep 'em for driving down the street a costing them terrorizing them if you want to use the term uh\nI I don't see the appropriate response then to the threat of violence\nThe ... the appropriate response in a\nCivilized society is to either arrest these people in the course of the police aren't there you have to defend yourself with food now are you still don't\nKnow I'm not a I but I'm I Am concerned that\nI ... as a talk show host I'm also\nConcerned you know the the only talk show host in America is who is been assassinated in my lifetime was Dave uh I think his name was the bird Allen Allen burned out to Colorado Alan ... seventies and and he you know he was killed by a couple of skinheads because he's been going off on the radio about right wing violence and so they came in and waited for them\nAnd because of this they overpaid in fees to the tune of thirty billion

subject of a fascism ...\nI Would say that and especially in the United states\nUm the concept of fascism in the United states has I Would say for the most part we've always been a fascist country per se in the sense of the extermination of Native Americans and the slave meant of African Americans\nFor those racial group sin categories there was always a hard ashes date with no civil rights at all in fact I think there was a known Chomsky said if if the U.S constitution was adopt today\nThe entire world with basically say would be a return to not seeing someone slavery in fact it was the horrific\nNamed the founders were very anti democratic\nUh that's why they put on the Supreme Court Stan it's um [noise] I've gerrymandering\nUm [noise] ... exactly and then they knew what they were doing when they step this all up don't act like they were you know\nIt was all about it was all about protecting the wealthy white men by and large\nExactly the oligarchy is\nBut you know and I am I I'm I'm I'm kinda haunted by I think it was Nineteen forty\nAnd I forget what year it was but uh you know Henry Wallace this was during World War two I I think it was forty one but it might have been forty three or ... whatever year was\nI'm Henry Wallace wrote this op ed for the New York times and and they asked him you know are there fascist in America who do we have to worry about and it was while we're fighting Germany and his reply was that you know the American Nazis\nAre not the people we have to worry about their their you know these are the FBI has them under close watch the people that we have to worry about are the are the are those who you know basically the corporate just the ones who who claimed patriotism wrap themselves and the flag and then just you know want to\nWant to want to you know peel away all the wealth in the country\nAnd I I Need to find that op ed ...\nRe read at one of these days on the air because it's such a good one but your and your point is well taken thanks a lot for the call a Lewis in Salisbury North Carolina Ellis and our uh Pacific affiliate there hey Louis what's up\nYeah how you doing Tom ... you know I was just listening to the caller days or with the um [noise] a Second Amendment right hype [laughter]\nOh man you know it seems to mean a lot of people are like they got that uh the KKK to ... and how they displayed there are right\nWhen they went in just a place the sanctuary and and as you know assassinated a nine parishioners\nYeah we have a homegrown terrorist organization that is you know the American version of ISIS it's called the Klan and and then the ... and then and now there's all these ancillary groups that you know they don't call themselves the Klan but they you know they're still marching down the street in Charlottesville saying he will not replace me you know where they're at work\nNow will happen to world\nWar two when a miracle white America and black or white America and uh with our allies and defeated Hitler and all of a sudden now all that live in life that we laws defeating Hitler Daytona America going to allow neo Nazis\nAnd you know you're not just really don't really care about the call but they just care about the complex ... white or you'd Jew\nSo that means they're all white people knew one day at black got we're about to clans but but all white people have to worry about ... because they don't care to call up your skin is if you're white America\nLight like all the shoes if you look at your school shootings all white kids got me a swat stickers all on the magazines canned goods and looking like oh I don't know something out of a\nWhatever the case may be but the white people need to get together and find out why did she is going on it's because they allow their children to\nBe transformed into Libya Nazis and and and it and it uses walk to\nHave you ever heard anything about the Las Vegas guy shooting was you have you with us not to because my wife and he had an opportunity to shoot up a concert of black but he he chose to shoot up a concert or a country of white people\nI don't know about that but I Do know who it was reported in the media you know as a reporter to the news is a fairly non controversy LA's so I you know is pretty straightforward stuff that he was a big consumer of right wing conspiracy stuff and then he ... books in his house and all that kind of stuff maybe\nFifty five [noise]\nWhere they are war and in Seattle a war on what's on your mind\nYeah I'm a really appreciate your show I watch it a lot I watch moxie now I'm I'm a left wing guy vote for Democrats\nI hear a coming yes um I just\nWanted to be another issue that's kind of easy to me um when I was Twenty years old I was brutally beaten by two guys\nAnd was successfully sued them\nLater in Nineteen Seventy four I got a gun permit\n\nTo protect myself because they friendly and\nWhy we have that's why we have a concealed weapon\nAh permits and you know it's I have no objection to a state issue in a license to carry a concealed weapon to people who have passed some sort of in a reasonable and relatively rigorous background check I got no problem with that war\nOkay well and and then later\nI don't think anybody has a problem with that I you know the the the problem that we have is that we're a washing guns we have half\nThe world's civilian guns in this country were four percent of the world's population and we have an ice and we have the highest rate of gun violence in the world and it has nothing to do with concealed carry permits it has to do with the you know the guy in the fact that in most states well actually every in every state now I Believe\nYou can walk into a gun show and buy a gun with no you know if if the if it's considered a quote private transaction a you know there's no background check there's no waiting period there is no there is no nothing and and we allow weapons of war to be carried on the streets of America and you know no other civilized country does that\nWhich is great which is crazy\nAnd I support getting rid of assault weapons and background checks\nYeah just a rational gun control stuff I mean we had this for ten years and and George W. Bush and the Republicans in two thousand five when the when the assault weapons ban expired and then had actually measurably reduced gun violence in the United states they stood out what the hell we don't need to renew that\nAnd then all of a sudden we're not all of a sudden but you know and now we're seeing more and more of these particular school shootings and mass murders that are being done with the you know with these kinds of weapons so\nYeah war on thank you for the call I you know I get it I get it you know with some people need to carry concealed weapons that's not the issue here Don and shoreline Washington dot eyes up on\nYeah you know I've been I don't know historical research in my life I'm not the leader fascism originated in the Roman Republic of the Roman empire sure\nThat's a you know that's why Mussolini use the ... as the logo the the the ... the bundle of sticks with a rope rerouted an ax sticking out of the top of it because you know that was that was the Roman that was a symbol of Roman power\nYeah so I guess you could sit in a way that Republicans are fascists in fashion serving up with\nWell it's it's increasingly looking that way and and that's a you know that's a that's a big concern Don thank you uh you know well said to Tomas in Rockford, Illinois I hate to us what's up\nIt was a to me what I see the way things are going is they're they're they're going to turn the Republicans are going to turn and don't agree it's going to turn this country and to a third world country\nAnd and uh to me that the division that's going not you know the Republican voted Republican people out on the is there to problem the problem is the Republican politicians\nThat while at a certain level to us we all ... you know depending on the metric here using were already a third world country we have you know Seventeen percent of us live in poverty\nI'm more than fifty percent of us can't sustain a thousand dollar expense I in fact you're more than ... percent of us can't sustain a thousand dollar eh expense we've got a a a infant mortality rate and a maternal mortality rate you know women dying in childbirth and pregnancy and and the children dying in their first two years of life\nThose those to death rates are right up there with a third world countries we are at the very very bottom of the thirty four CD countries so you know we're right on the edge of the transition from being a fully developed country to being a third world country\nI I just she she things getting worse and it's you know it is the Republicans and he's only guards that are just making things worse that's about all that got\nYeah well I think is that a well and I and you know this this this multi trillion dollar transfer of wealth since Nineteen eighty and ... the you know took place or has brought us this bill and Portland hey bill what's up\nHigh um the ah fascism is tied in with business and\nUm when the comp administrators and you know they've been barring anybody involved with the cannabis industry coming in from Canada on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry alcohol industry in the tobacco industry that's an example of the fat a fascist dictatorship and action but also\nNot allowing a also ... only bad things are being a for public announcements regarding the cannabis industry and cannabis you know in general [noise] um so and and also like\nI don't see that as fascism bill I you know I I see that as bad policy\nAnd and you know punitive and or retribution or however you pronounce that word if it is even a word um you know and and it's a reflection of justice Jeff Sessions or you know firm belief that to vote you know pot is somehow associated with with the\n...

Arabia I understand he had a half a Fifteen at a meeting with the the uh\nA king who apparently is in full blown dementia and eight thirty minute meeting with a NBS uh Mohammed bin Salman the prince who was basically running the country\nOr what what do we know about this and has any of this I you know what's the latest shtick that to Saudi Arabia is try to I understand turkey came out and said yup they found DNA and blood evidence that uh that Mr ... showed I was saying 'cause showed me I guess that's a show gee\nUh was murdered in in the in the embassy or in the consulate or what's the what's the latest on this\nWell let me because you you mentioned this last but Turkish a sort of a line about what occurred last night during this nine hour period in which there were Turkish crime scene investigators on the scene at the embassy depends on who you ask and I will say that while there have been\nSome media reports confirming exactly what you just send a you know sort of more conclusive evidence of\nOf blood or other sorts of you know remains of Mr ...\nThat the Turkish president Russia aired on himself has been a lot more muted saying look it's inconclusive we do have some suspicions that major portions of walls if not entire rooms were re painted and he sort of hinted that that might have been an effort to conceal some sort of toxic substance or otherwise\nThey brought this ... crew and you know describe the style with bleach before they before they painted it\nYeah I mean I I Do think at every turn the Saudis are sending a pretty clear a signal that they really don't care about appearances here ah you know if if you are going to and we haven't you know these media reports from CNN and NBC which works you know swirling around last night\nThat the Saudi Government has sort of figured out the party line and that they were gonna chalk this whole thing up to a botched interrogation which are was evidently supposed to subdue this guy but not kill 'em and then put them on a plane back to Saudi Arabia um\nThey haven't officially stuck with that narrative and why you know I Wonder who the source of this war on NAFTA the it is telling I think how thoroughly pick through that you know kind of line of reasoning was but I'm not really sure at this point out you know two weeks after this\nIs Saudi Arabia can possibly I even have a a a lie here that uh they can stay with a straight face a this is very difficult to demonstrate that you were concerned about\nI don't know some rogue actor or something operating within your embassy if\nYou know it was looted long Trump came out and said if if this is true that is going to be severe consequences I'm a ... or at least his spokespeople a response to that said\nWe will stick a dagger into the heart of the American economy if you try to punish us have they backed us down as a ... rolled over\n[laughter] well I mean he said pretty clearly that we are not you know ... ... in the same breath in which he's been saying uh we are going about severe consequences if this guy was killed by the Saudis he's also made it perfectly clear arms deals are not even on the table so it's kind of unclear if\nThere's even a middle ground that he has in mind or he just hopes that at some point some treasury official can say okay here's had like two or three kind of pinprick things we can do and you can go to your you know can go on to say that\nWas seen at treasury by the way Steve ... went to Saudi Arabia this way or how\nI you know I don't have the I don't have I'm On my list of people I've been tracking who are going to go to the ... and the death\nOf as of yesterday he was still planning to go but to Trump and there'd be surprised\nIf he pulled out I mean I just don't think there's any sign from the destruction of of really any sort of moral reckoning occurring here and my prediction\nIs that someone on the Saudis side is going to be put forward as\nA fall guy here and even the fact that the Saudis have you know go to demonstrated quite a\nWillingness to it you know basically purge their members of the royal family members of the business elite in that country they've got experience dealing with not just sort of mid level people who they need to you know drop through the ... or whatever that game of Thrones so miserable is but\nDo this for senior officials to and which makes me think\nThey will be willing actually to blame this on some ... or senior level military intelligence officer and say look he was trying to burnish his credentials as a you know hard line guy who's going after enemies of the kingdom except cheap actually betrayed the king then because he put his own\nPersonal ambitions over the interest\nThen and he may not even based on mid level ... and they can just drags some guy out of prison and say okay you're going to pretend that you're Joe blow and they're going to say this is Joe blow he was in the interrogation room and now we're going to cut us off and not give them an opportunity to say a word that you all agree ...\nRight I mean I'm not saying they're not going to do that but it would be preposterous seeming to make the fall guy is a junior level official when it went so many media reports suggest this was a a major operation that could only open authorized from senior\nWell wait let me understand I wouldn't you know so that

much time they I wanted to make a comment about um you know how the ... that academic topic of fascism are at the um you know what I'm saying I don't mean it in a negative way\nThe um uh you know the message about neo liberalism is getting out I had a debate with the guy at work on Neal liberalism and I had to tell him finally that hey look\nIn my opinion Neal conservatism and Neal liberalism is like choosing between him locking arsenic you pick your poison right I mean I I have no\nWell now conservatism has its focus on on war and and imperialism and Neal liberalism has its focus on economics and and uh uh you know the the the the power of the very wealthy\nBut there have yeah but there's a whole lot of conflation between the two\nThere is and you know we all go through periods where we're sympathetic to each I think you know and the thing is is I just want to um you shut me up from my point really well\nI think we are in a neo conservative a cycle really in the world but for chicken while in the western world it specifically in America and my issue with that is is neoconservatives and can flip\nIf the if the environment it's correct or if the environment is just right it can flip industry to academic fascism\nNow what kills my argument is a we have elections but this this this whole election paying it is really minor um you know it is a minor aspect All right we cannot be ... we don't even know if these elections are legitimate number one\nNumber two is All right like if you look at recently this s four hundred anti aircraft system the Russians are building\nThey're selling that to um turkey turkey is a NATO country it is just a better weapons systems for the price\nNow I read two articles Warren Russia is doing this to try to um you'll find out classified information about NATO air defense to Russia is doing this to to shoot down to figure out how to shoot down the F thirty five\nWell if if the neo conservatives figure this out Boeing and Lockheed and all them figure this out that the F thirty five ... ... you know that the ... of government is why one when you have to for twice the price don't make enough thirty six\nHour job hypothetically and this is all you know the cycle of money neo conservatives them and the evolution and the fascism\nAnd I would say that most of this began I mean you know we can track a lot of this back to the Vietnam War in fact we can track probably similar back to the Korean War but in a big way of began after nine eleven\nAnd of course that was the neoconservatives you know the big dream I mean they're they're they're hallelujah moment that they talked about in Nineteen Ninety eight in the project for new American Century signed by Jeb Bush among others um that that basically said that that implored Bill Clinton to attack Saddam Hussein and take down the government of Iraq\nAnd so you know when George W when he became president uh you know everybody was talking about he was an illegitimate president but hey we had this great peace dividend remember the peace dividend ... at the end of the century\nAnd you know because of the fall of the Soviet Union and we didn't need to have all these nuclear weapons and all this stuff and the nine eleven happens and suddenly off to the races you know okay uh and and George Bush had a choice he could've said okay you got Seventeen hijackers Fifteen of 'em are Saudis\nOr we're going to collaborate with Saudi Arabia and we're going to and we're going to collaborate with Afghanistan where this apparently was plotted\nAnd uh and and by the way we had a decent relationship with Afghanistan at that point in time just six months earlier George Bush and given forty million dollars to Afghanistan to distribute to their poppy farmers and they hadn't burned to something like Seventy percent of the poppy fields\nIn Afghanistan enthusiastically in exchange for more money than they would have gotten if they've grown up and sold it\nAnd so you know when when Mullah Omar said oh my God this terrible thing that happened to you guys we will arrest bin Laden and the five thousand people will hang out with him here in Afghanistan and we will turn out well at least by bin Laden anyway we will turn them over to you or not to the United states but to a third you know a neutral third party\nOr George Bush said no I Want to have a war\nAnd and you know and and then we would Afghanistan and then of course Iraq and we lie to us into Iraq and here we are both in both those war so we're still in that neo conservative ...\nAnd I absolutely agree and have that out of that this is this is James Madison this is exactly what James Madison was talking about I've got I've got the quotes someplace here but I guess I don't have it where I can grab it but James Madison said\nNo nation and no democracy can survive in a state of perpetual war he said in war all the very worst things are amplified because so much more power goes to the executive to the president\nAnd ... and therefore war is the great enemy of democracy in the United states he was absolutely right and that's what we're seeing a day or to add to that for
