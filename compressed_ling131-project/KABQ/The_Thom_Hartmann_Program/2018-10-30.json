on going into the future uh so\nWe're recording this on Sunday but we uh we already maxed out on the number of interviews for Sunday so hurry on Monday a talking with Kevin ... who is joining me here now from medical genomic now Kevin we first met\nAt a a a bitcoin conference in California I think you're right yes a win or for whatever reason the organizers screwed up or what it was ... years it'll be any that's it right to any\nOf the de centralized conference yeah yeah it was a big ... conference but um they had screwed up the hotel or something like that and they hadn't gotten us the hotel room that we needed to get in order to stay and you\nWere like hey I Know those guys I listen to their show come on and you gave us your hotel room and shared your hotel room with me are yeah [laughter]\nRight it's meant for strangers well yeah it was but it was all good that's good I was comfortable to it worked out and it turns out you're actually in the medical cannabis space that's right that's right and medical genetics tell me what it is you do and then we'll tied into the block chain of wire here at the the crypto\nClams so we make a variety of genetic tests are canvas um there are tests that look for pathogens that in fact the plant that can destroy ... we also make a DNA test to look for human pathogens in the plant um things like ... I mean all of these things have to get tested on every\nA unit of cannabis that sold while I'm it's it's it's it's just actually different state to state as to what has to get tested but uh we service all the states and Canada and then we also do a lot of sequencing of these cannabis genomes and we ... them onto the dash walking and people are doing this\nOh hold on a sequencing a genome hashing it onto a dash ... that sounds really complicated is their way to make that understandable for you know the audience who doesn't even know anything about ... points\nSo just as a way of getting a digital ... of a plant that you can't really notarized today are the most of the ... systems are run by banks and banks have federal um\nI mean when I have a notary I think I'm somebody somebody at a banquet the stamp stamping a document what do you mean I live right when I was really noticed rising appliance\nSo I ... for a defensive ah IP reasons or sometimes even off into Bybee reasons you need to prove that something exists in one way to prove a\nPlan exist as the sequences genome but then you've got to get a notarized that hold on is that a specific plan or is that like a type of plant like you know ... or something like ... above a crush of the people are interested in different ... make unique can nab annoyed and unique ... and so um if you read something\nYou might want to prevent it from getting pounded so you'll put it public I\nAs a form of prior art but you want a notarized that when you put a public and\nThe banks will notarized these things yet and so what people do is you do some DNA sequencing on the plan to get I get a fingerprint of it yeah and then you make a hashtag that data\nAnd making a hash of that data is a is a cryptic graphic process that is unique directional that means you can take the sequence run into our room and get the same ... every time you can't go the other direction\nBut then you can put that hash into a bitcoin or a dash transaction and that was recorded on the block shame which are minute let permanently which has a time stamp and it's the most important thing is it's a mutual Bryant be changed by the time stamps are trustworthy\nLet me see if I following this year so you've got the ah this this type of a pot plant a cannabis plant\nIt or something that you've created or whatever and you know you combine other planes together however it is these tweets them to make this thing\nAre you then sequence the genome yes use and has that Geno you get the unique code that identifies that do you know not to be confused with other forms of ... like the ... and then you put that hash which is a unique number that specifically identify that type of plant\nOnto the block chain to say we made this at this time\nShe exactly okay and and the government of China has recently the Supreme Court and try and has recently recognized watching ... and in fact illegal wow warm of ... a respect the same thing to happen the United states\nRight and that is actually comes back to something we were talking with Randy ... about yesterday of how ... is going to help free people from the government and allow us to do our own thing without having to ask permission you used to have to go to a government notary in order to get things notarized now you can just do your own thing that's right\nThat's right and this also as a um an interesting form of I'm sharing that you can be done when many people are putting these genomes public they're actually creating like a cannabis linked in many ways where you were growers can look for strains that are very close to there is there with ... or strains that are very distant from there as\nA and that helps them get in touch with people that have unique genetics and they might be able to then make additional crosses so while the genetics is a really interesting um barcode if you will because it gives so much information about the Herod ability of the plant [noise] it's so cool to see\nAll this happened I mean I Know a lot about uh you know the the black market dealings of cannabis from back in the nineties and the odds when you know you just kind of took whatever you could get and then you you know you got it out\nThere now there's so much a research going on this and it's just getting started right like this is just getting started yeah\nIn fact the first genetic surveys of of like hundreds or thousands of plants have shown that this indicates a team that nomenclature system we have is is actually all rubbish really yes there there's no correlation with indications that the the labeling to the actual\nGenetic ancestry of the plants okay so this means we throw all that out for all that out of 'em are made one time unreal but even so in our in our bread in the black markets now that we really can't uh utilize that as an indicator of the king the type of the plant\nOkay like what type of can nab annoyed chirping is going to express don't really have any correlation between into ... so you just have to break it down and get a look at the ah yeah we got we need about ... system wow and that's kind of are you working on that we are we are so um we just were funded by dashed to actually sequence\nI'm a very thorough genome we call this a reference gene I'm\nBack in two thousand Lebanese sequenced Kim dog and put a public but the technology we had back there left it really fragments and so it was a genome reference that won the average\nSize of the pieces in the genome assembly were about three thousand letters long it's not very long you can still do something with that but um it's uh you can't really read entire gene structure is when I was broken up that way\nSo dashed wanted us to really stick with the very thoroughly so we have like a chromosome chromosome tip perfect map of the genome a and that helps us because once we have a really thorough referenced week and then compare everything was done historically did that with much more procession [noise]\nWow Did you found this company I had on like yeah yeah two thousand eleven uh we've been uh mostly operating I'm working with these QBC our test these tests to look for microbes on the plan to make sure we don't have pathogens and the plant getting into people's lungs and that's been selling in the marketplace for several years now is probably used in over Ninety different labs across the country\nAnd today the user has to install the up in the business has to ... to get the benefits soon we're going to take it even further so that even if the business does sign up usually doesn't have to ... allow them to swipe their credit cards to charge\nInstead of having both ends of the solution being blocked chain will start off with just having the businesses into a social being ...\nAnd then help people migrate over very similar to what um [noise]\nUh gosh what is it um [noise] Starbucks dead Starbucks was taking rub your credit card transactions cards and they introduced their application now this kind of the largest role in the world in terms of funds inside the wallet too so that I have a private ... parents here [noise]\nOkay so um take me through I guess an example of this I Am a I'm a local person uh you know I'm looking to buy a certain product or\nYou know how do I come across digital town in the first place you know when\nYou're getting the word out that are going to to to engage local media are getting earned media and we're getting reaching out to a community mostly business groups business based trying to talk to members chamber of commerce\nA member of Congress um recently the\nUm Austin's south Austin's business association signed up and they're having a sign up all their members as an example I see okay we're also been reaching out to farmers markets\nTo do this and gauging the communities are getting the awareness out and so the worrying us we're starting to happen we've got about four thousand users and you're already signed up in Austin for having now is is when did this start ... we started is launching a move over the summer right okay so brand new brand new okay\nSo you're getting the word out to people and the idea is hey this will help connect you better with local businesses to find the things you want to find locally rather than on line right it can ensure\nBy local type of situation you know a lot of communities have this idea I think we should buy local support local they do have that yeah that's and it's growing where\nWhere I'm from Keene New Hampshire they have a little phrase it's keen to buy local it's exactly\nSo by using this you're sure that you're doing that ... you know because it's a searches local businesses it's all bound by your body arranged to get your location of your cell phone ... we'd be present local businesses\nSo uh obviously the big challenge right and the reason why people go on line it's because they get something for less you know you maybe the maybe the product is available at a local business but maybe it's more expensive is there any way to attract people to this beside the sort of loyalty of local\n... yeah a few ways actually so so much for less can be argued but what were some businesses are with our system for doing now with our system is is new for us is as business is joining you they're giving discounts to users other system to overcome that\nYou know ten percent off twenty percent off you know some of the deals are pretty pretty nice okay so that's one one message on my terms of use less what I've found myself is when I'm buying online it's easier to find the item\nAnd then I learned later that item that have been just down the street I just didn't know they existed mhm so what um where we are going to do it doesn't do completely today as it today a business can list items for sale what we're going to do is allow that to happen more electronically so we can index all around him and tore\nSo that'll wow yeah as you do a search you know I'm searching for a red pair of shoes this model number\nYou know I wanted to show up in our system and I can see here's the to dealers and here's one sort of you know a corner store that I can buy that out you know as a subscription store\nAnd then I can search it I can find out just showed up on a map right now in our system do instead of having to order and wait you can just drive down the street yeah go pick it up right\nOkay so we do that today with food items like in in our system today him you can log in your hair Austin you can say I want to fish taco this afternoon sorted out his tacos I already have all of the menus indexed so I can show you on the map right here here's the three places within walking distance you can go get a fisherman\nI haven't eaten lunch yet [laughter] okay All right so you get the idea right yeah yeah yeah okay so how does crypto currency tie into all this because not everyone who's you know in business is ready to start taking crypto so is there well here here you come to a conference right here at my behind me up\nSo I'm very ... I was one of the speakers for um what was the um [noise]\nThe small businesses and cared about corrupt or they don't they they are struggling to do their business typically they're five employees or less right and so trying to teach them a new technology they don't have time for it well I mean just think back a little bit this was disgusting like how the um\nWhere you know I was part of the early launched their net I was at ... you know I was part of the whole deal and just getting Internet out you know if it became different when it wasn't a matter of getting a messy one from a telephone company and getting a Cisco router\nAnd everyone was running around doing that but that's kind of what we're doing right now with crypto and block chick ...\nIs like if you want to play you need to get at that level and then the next ... months we introduced a floppy disk you put in your computer and suddenly you're connected to the Internet\nI signed up a quarter million users over a summer right ... blew up\nSo I'm trying to do with this I Want to simplify the offering so for businesses were not saying this was crypto this is the ... were not telling them\nAbout it is of course we have to be to do what we're doing but the just the glaze over we start ... explain that to them they care about services capability so ... ... when\nThey're using our system now most of the comments I guess wow that was easy you know they stole the out they use the service they just go click click you're done you get your money done\nAnd so in behind the scenes we take care of all the crypt and block chain when it comes into the system you support sixteen feel currencies we took a nice to them\nAnd we allow in our system behind the scenes or took her eyes that can move back and forth ... views are doesn't see tokens they're not giving a donation Jones man he was up on the money is put in escrow account doesn't move so so bank charges are not being incurred ... I'm not moving from one physical count on their physical kept on moving tokens around between wallet\nAs a customer paying through the digital town that's correct okay let's ... so the ultimately the business owner gets the ought\nIf that's what they're looking to lessen the interesting thing so because we're supporting all these ... let's say you are you a hero mhm\nUm and I have a wall of dollars and you present me your your o.s wallet I'm zapping money over to you it gets converted into Europe slots really we just convert the bank rates no magic know crazy stuff it just happens\nUsers don't either we worried about it for also this is a completely work yeah we do it for ... or ... but we're adding a theory I mean if you're the token as currencies but what we want to do that we want to do that with took US Currency is too so I'm a food truck down the street here and you know I'm I'm selling some interesting food some guy you know between guys here\nHe's got a bunch of bitcoins he wants to buy some food\nWhy make him convert that into ... but ... with with guys currency so\nThe the food truck presents their wallet they're there to your co they ask for a token US Currency and so I asked for fear currency they weren't dollars [noise]\nThe guy with the tokens zaps that they get dollars he got the detrimental token wow dollars and we take care of all the difficult stuff you know within the system\nIt doesn't have to be bused end users don't have to care about that okay cool I mean people are asking if the business the discussion is um our winter business is going to adopt this how are they gonna do that\nThey need to do it without knowing it it's like nowadays people are using the Internet didn't even realize they're using the Internet you know my wife gets on her

in a integrating juggling into the ... going conference and we're like okay sure\nAnd he knows that we do gigs like this around town or other groups and and things get paid to get her to yeah we we get a you know we make a little bit of money because we have a an annual festival that we do in late February every year where we're at ... here in Austin we bring in joggers from all over\nSo we get some city funding and then we have to raise some revenue for matching funds or for that and uh so yeah we're we're a\nPretty active little nonprofit is all centered around one activity but a Paul is very familiar with the with our operations he wanted to support us and I support him so\nSo did you get a you get paid to come here I have to wait I'm hired guns very cool and I've seen a few other

states ... somebody's not in Austin which is probably where most people are listening is outside of Boston what should they do if they want to get in you know get in the world of juggling where so where to get started\nSure will now of course we have the Internet so you know when I first started juggling uh it was just before the Internet exploded and uh\nThe only way you could find out was through organizations like the international jugglers association\nA and they are still around but they're having to reinvent themselves in the age of the Internet because everybody started goes there but if you just Google you're a city and juggling you can usually find somebody organization yeah there there there are most major cities across the U.S\nHave some a juggling activity um some of it may be sporadic but it is pretty widespread these days and and mainly because of the Internet\nIs fantastic I I think it's a it's a you know it's an old art right like this goes back\nCentury I think I I I don't know the exact date but there are some cliffs from a ancient Egypt that while juggling and I think that is the oldest depiction of juggling national naturally that three thousand years yeah\nFor sure so it started with like you know people are working for the king basically yeah right yeah entertaining to entertain the king and his holy gestures don't drop one of them in front of a king or else I mess things probably a little less risky to\nYeah there's a whole history of it ah um you know there there there are books ... uh to to learn about the history of juggling it's\nFantastic Texas juggling society uh what's your website a juggling dot ... dot org very cool thanks for coming here on a free talk life I really appreciate your time my pleasure enjoy the deck

O. R. I. Z. E. N.\nDot global is the website and the reason for it as we've been promoting on to our audience for the last month or so uh is because horizon\nIs a much bigger concept than just a crypto currency and we actually have one of the founders here at Texas bitcoin conferences name as Rove bursts bursts loose versus ... where's that name from\nUh my dad's Dutch Dutch and the lives they say it differently over there the how did they say that South slow\n[laughter] welcome a role to uh to free talk lives first time we've had you on the show we had the rug leoni on previously to talk about a Zen cash again is now known as horizon you're one of the founders tell me about how you got involved way back when\nSure yeah so I got involved from the money side of things so I'm a big proponent of liberty and uh uh so that uh the\nPrivacy technology that was inherent in the cash or was a wonderful and your own knowledge anonymity yeah well as your knowledge to prove or as a and they're able to essentially give you the ability to do private transactions or anonymous transactions are still recorded on the block chain\nSo I came out just from being a cadet currency minor I got involved in mining ... classic and met ... Rob through the classic community which has a good strong thriving community enough of people that were that are and where privacy\nUm lovers and we decided we were talking about okay what are we going to do to incorporate some of these other great ideas from other crypto currency is\nHaving a treasury continuous development um be going out and about and letting people know a building beautiful wallets and then when inevitably who's the crypto currency gets very successful\nAnd the people who were taken business away from banks in Western Union and folks like that and start to attack or a network how do we make sure we keep the nose up and running so we put together a whole ... Rob started talking to put together a plan for lunch and the crypto currency then cash at the time and now horizons\nBecause the cash which was getting what the was the first one that how does your knowledge didn't have any of that other stuff that you talked about it was just we got privacy and that was it so you guys brought all these extra ideas to the table and we're talking with I forget who it was the other day but\nA Zen cash now is the number one most well distributed decentralized more nodes you know from the super nose to the secure knows\nMore than any other crypto currency out there am I right about that\nYeah that's right and so when your wallet does to send a transaction to receive a transaction it actually over the Internet next needs to connect to a note so you need to be able to connect to a note and it's great to have them close by fast ready to service you know having over twenty two thousand knows which is what we have now does does she been around ... around the globe\nOr it's going to make sure that even if you're in a country that tries to block access to crypto currency you should be able to access a Zen note for and be able to complete your transactions so reliability and security as part of the deal right and you set it up so that people running the secure knows and the super nodes\nGet paid for that we do and that keeps them incentivized to the system up and running it also distributed to send to people\nAll over the world which then encourages them to create a is an economy which is another part of what we need to do we can't just send crypto around and ask investors to invest it and say you know we get lots of crypto out there we need to actually create\nAlternative economies to to see a currency for if we can get people to uh buy and pay and that's one of the reasons we got on to and I know a lot of your listeners are involved with any pay I was just about to ask yeah we're on any pay you can use and on that\nI Love any pay and I don't just say that because uh it's a great system I happened to be the the roommate of one of the founders in the past J Freeman used to be one of the co hosts you're on TALK live used to live with me in Keene and he's one of the any day founders a and those guys man they've done such a great job\nCreating a useful point of sale system and we've we've certainly talk to our listeners about that um when we brag about keen in Portsmouth New Hampshire being the capitals of the world\nAs far as real life crypto currency acceptance it's because of those guys at any pay and and what they've done I mean I've been telling people here at this conference\nLike or I can buy barbecue I can buy you know or I can buy pizza I can buy birders I can buy\nPipes and tobacco at the corner store before I came to this conference I had my old changed on my route for as a a auto facility that takes crypto currency and all of these companies are using any pay and that was then is available as one of the crypto currency isn't any pay absolutely and that's that's a\nPart of the ecosystem equation which is to get the vendors are the the business people to accept it but also to get a whole group of users to to spend it so right now you could for example on your mobile device download a coin only wallet ah put yours in on that and just skin and pay it's really easy to do now of course we know me is easy to use\nAnd it's got a bunch of crypt us but it doesn't allow you to use the privacy aspects of that it doesn't and so there's really no a mobile wallet yet that has the ability to privacy aspect subs in or are you working on that yes absolutely so one of the things that we benefit from is the advances and as your knowledge proof technology\nOh yeah I think I Would rather use the word a competition versus collaboration so in a world of competition you're going to have large privately held corporations like\nYouTube or Google okay and they can kick you off at any time they can do whatever they want on the other side you have\nA collaboration where you have on opinionated benign tools like Linux or pretty much like Web browser and they don't betray you or they don't suddenly switch things behind the scenes and suddenly ever really different products\nSo my understanding is that another less libertarian but not one of the socialist libertarians is that basically ... you know where we differ from other libertarians is ... you know what we consider to be property rights that are enforced by the government versus property rights that are more like a natural rights\nSo it sounds like you're disagreeing that I'm intellectual property is any kind of like natural or moral property right and it only exists because the state grants\nYou know patents and trademarks and copyright that correct\nI Would say the state is totally involved in a in forcing them to actual property right but I Would go even further and say that I Would like to see less ownership of large property like nobody should\nBe a huge amount of property I'm with the state or anyone using violence to exclude others from using it you know working on\nKind of kind of getting back to the way you were talking about a working around the uh existence of copyright laws the whole point of like GPL and um what is Danielle license a new public license okay basically a copy left it basically as the basic idea behind it is that you can\nRedistribute the source code of a program\nAnd you cannot take away any ones right to\nDo it sounds like a creative commons gets ... off the weight of comments but but for software All right\nI I'm a huge fan of creative commons I'm a huge fan of open source things that's why I'm kind of can I ask you to do a whole bunch of different open source project young bitcoin itself so that that's how I was confused when Greg was saying you know contrasting what he sees as libertarian socialist versus the\nThe free market libertarian I did I didn't know where open source fits into that distinction\nYeah I think what it is is that there's a few issues under which people who otherwise agree on most things that are considered libertarian positions disagree\nUm and with regards to property rights one of them is what can be property and so there's some libertarians that believe ideas can be property and other libertarians that believes that it can't\nI'm going further into libertarian socialism there's some libertarians who believed that land can be property and other libertarians to believe that it cannot\nUh so ultimately we all agree that we should have property rights but we disagree over what we consider is possible to the property and to be owned by an individual or buy a business\nI mean it's sort of a it's an attitude that you are or how much can you own can I own the entire Lake Ontario or eerie\nIf if you know I'm able to own it can I didn't do anything with it so a left libertarians say no you can't own that much property because you're one human being\nAnd people should be free from New York City you know over this lake\nUm and you know someone who's a capitalist a libertarian so of course you can own\nDisney World and you can just call the shots in Disney World\nAnd the next next town over as a democratically run Alan Weil Dr legitimate because you know whatever but Disney World his own and that makes it suddenly okay or does need to do pretty much wherever wants in that and you're neither the NGOs do\nHere basically looking at you know a a private corporation\nYou know who the shareholders elect to the board and who they decide to hire to run things versus a town where the citizens decide who they're going to elect to the city council and the city council decide who they're going to run things and you're asking what really fundamentally is the difference\nBetween those two especially well controlling a territory like Disneyland versus the town\nTo me there's just a smaller version of a government actually they're not smaller they're pretty much the\nInside a town can be smaller than wronged by citizens but to me the governance structure\nIs not the issue for me much one individual and exclude others from a lake or a land or anything like that and I think there should be limited I don't think one individual should have you know I don't think eight people in the world should have the well\nHalf the world and\nThat is one of the things that I find energy so I assume you're familiar with are probably a member of the libertarian socialist caucus as a Libertarian Party\nAnd I found it interesting that um you know when there's controversy about their formation and their activities and the candidate that they ran for a national chair of the Libertarian Party this year a lot of the people who were freaking out about them were anarchist and it's like who do you think is actually enforcing\nThe a property rights over land that the libertarian socialists are objecting to the state so\nI never really understood how they were all these anarchists thinking like\nA you know all this private ownership of large amounts of land that they were not actively using her maintaining was going to exist if there were suddenly no state\nIn that way and I just want to point out that the founders of for example the open source movement I'm not that philosophical but Richard Stallman who started the free software and\nHe's on the left and he often critiques a little bitterness and John Law\nWho lived many years you know centuries ago where the the concept of homes getting an article was used came from him but he said\nIf you read his work the one man who owns so much land that allows vegetables to run in the field use misusing the land and you shouldn't actually in charge of that much land that was John ...\nYeah I mean I'm personally a left libertarian in Georgia so I'm not so far as a libertarian socialists because my understanding is they're basically um mostly inner communist whereas I'm men are is\nBecause I Do think private ownership of land is the most effective and efficient way to do it so then I adore just because I think well if the government's enforcing your private ownership of land you should be paying for that\nBut yeah a lot of people go back to the basic you know John Locke argument of how one morally obtains\nPrivate ownership of a resource that you could argue should be common to everyone the earth and a lock in for provides even says you can only do so quote at least where there is enough and as good left in common for others so now that we live hundreds of years later we uh you know the whole world is owned at this\nPoint Greg thank you for the call of your calls and thoughts

US dollars gold silver or anything of that sort\nSeems reasonable yeah\nI'm not an expert on a campaign finance law but how do they treat contributions made in foreign currency is like year as to the U. S. candidates if they came from a U.S citizen them yes that is going to happen to be contributing like pounds or ... or whatever has that ever happened\nI Am pretty sure like everything that happened at some point like here I have you know this leftover cash\nFrom my trip to Europe and I'll give it to your camp campaign 'cause they don't want to go to that you know currency range stats can exchange it so I'm sure it's happened how has that been treated 'cause I Would think the legal precedent would it be to treat it like a foreign currency because it's basically a now their currency right\nAnd not as clear out whatever the exchange rate is on the day that you received it I guess\nI guess I mean I yeah so whatever the treatment is it that and it's that prohibited which I don't think it should be um then it I Would think crypto would be prohibited in the same way and it's not prohibited then I Would think it'd be handled the same as if somebody had to do this stack as heroes\nRight and then the real question would be is there a limit on the amount of zeroes that somebody could hand you\nKnow I Would assume the whatever the exchange rate in rent us\nIf we have a US dollar amount yeah theory I wouldn't be some sort of arbitrary limit with bitcoin they just say oh\nIt's an income contribution but you can only accept a hundred dollars I don't know of any other income contribution where they put a limit yeah that's definitely ridiculous yeah so it's one of these things to where they're just you know creating up regularly\nSo ... as they go along and hoping that people try to follow it a continuing on they've actually got a couple of interesting questions here is crypto currency secure enough to be used for political purposes\nFifty four percent of voters said yes and that includes a majority of Republicans sixty three percent a majority of Democrats fifty two per se that and a plurality of independent voters forty five percent\nAlso Seventy three percent of people who reported being extremely familiar with crypto currency believed that it was secure enough for political purposes and I would say it's at least as secure as any government fee on currency\nThe survey also says that independent and libertarian minded voters at times appear more progressive or open to new ideas and concepts than their democratic and Republican counterparts\nHowever many state governments have jumped on the bandwagon of digital currencies there are several reasons why state governments are hesitant to adopt crypto currency donations but the two major ones are the validity of crypto currency and the anonymity of the donor one of the hallmarks of block chain technology\nA ruling by the Kansas governmental ethics commission in October twenty Seventeen is an excellent example of why most states remain leery of digital currencies and of course they link over to it but they don't give any kind of quotes from it\nTo the you know anonymity crypto currency I can see is an issue because you do want to know but you know\nWell I Know you have specific objections the FCC personally but yeah the way that campaign finance works is we want to know where donations are coming from when they're coming from ... where they work for where they live\nRight now you just collect that information when somebody writes you a check or makes a credit card donation or donates cash\nI don't know if that's audited in any way so if I come to your campaign event and hand you a you know fifty dollars in cash and fill out a little form saying you

with whatever is on your mind\nThe U.S in Studio tonight as Daryl Michael and Jackie and we'll get into this Donald Trump story where apparently he has\nScheduled way more executive time\nThan he is scheduled work time story from Politico says Donald Trump had about three times as much free time planned for last Tuesday as work time according to his private schedule the president was slated for more than nine hours of votes\nExecutive time\nA euphemism for the un structured time the Trump spends trading phoning friend than watching television official meetings policy briefings and public appearances typically the daily work of being president\nConsumed barely three hours of his day the person that was also slated to spend thirty minutes on the phone with CEOs or make brief remarks at a state Leadership Conference\nHe was briefed by senior military leaders in the evening and join them for dinner aside from eleven thirty am meeting with White House chief of staff John Kelly is first commitment of the day the rest of his day was unstructured summoned blocks as long as two hours forty five minutes\nSo\nWe know from previous things a big chunk of that as he spends all morning watching Fox and friends to the point of which White House staffers who want to get something on to his agenda we'll coordinate with the producers of Fox and friends to try and arrange for specific gas to come on the show like that's been expose\nPreviously\nYeah they are they have to go through back channels to get things under the president's agenda through the TV show that he watches all morning long\nPretty much every day now I did hear something a while back that apparently and the briefings that he receives\nA several White House a staff member speaking on the condition of anonymity said he likes hearing his name so we have to put his name in the briefings a lot so that he keeps paying attention\nYeah there was even a thing recently where they were talking about how he was having all these conversations with you know people in the media business whatnot on his personal cell phone because he didn't want to have it logs through the White House switchboard talking about various things\nWhich is basically what he and his supporters thought Hillary Clinton should be locked up for ... ... email server to discuss sensitive information right but is that a lot of the sources you report it they said it's OK he doesn't play close enough close enough attention in the intelligence briefings to know anything that he can be giving away in these conversations\nAnd apparently the national archives has had to hire people to go behind Donald Trump to tape\nPapers back together because part of his uh process ... yeah process over however many years of being a business man and I'm using air quotes there are when he's done with a task that written on paper he ripped the paper\nOr small Pete is not just that if he doesn't like a report or document he's been given he cares it up like a toddler\nBut I Would say the whole upside of this long executive time versus small amount of work time it's like isn't really for the best like do we really want him working more hours doing more of whatever it is that he wants to do like I'm pretty unhappy with most of what Trump does so if he was just like to\nDo all executive time on the line just like to go on vacation until the end of his term yeah if he just wants to go yeah golf for\nAnother two years I Would be fine with that\nYeah and you know I I'll say one more thing here a lot of people give Congress a hard time because all they had a week and a half of vacation well no they should really only being session for like\nAll a tenth of the time that they're actually in session a few weeks now

Portland, Oregon hey Lisa thanks listed x-ray FM what's on your mind to\nOhio you were just talking about the parents in Silicon valley so don't let their kids is smart phones and such I have a teenage daughter she's Seventeen I've been fighting that since she was six I mean when she went into public school I asked the teachers what are you doing to protect our kids\nAnd they just never had answered for me and then when the smartphone came along my daughter is smart and she enjoys the technology and so\nShe gravitated towards that right away\nIt was just frightening to me and my husband and I would disagree about it I told him she should not get a smartphone in middle school he was like all all her friends have smartphones and it's a social thing if she doesn't have the smartphone she'll be ostracized socially\nAnd had this argument with my husband event and it just has torn our family apart in many ways and you know she's doing fine now that I've had to just fight it all through her school years\nAnd it and she has anxiety anyway and so then when this came along and she couldn't access anything on line and bring her warnings ID\nIt just really I had to keep talking to her about what she's going to and what's going on and and you know people in Silicon valley they notice and they know it it doesn't and that's why they're keeping their kids away from it\nYeah absolutely and and I mean it's\nI in fact from this article and in today's New York times Silicon Valley nannies are phone police for kids um the summer is some some of these parents are even producing no phone contracts which guarantees zero unauthorized screen exposure for their nanny to sign\nThe fear of screens has reached the level of panic in Silicon valley vigilantes now posed for photos to parenting message boards\nPossible man he's using cell phones near children which is to say the very people building these glowing ... have become increasingly terrified of them\nSaid they built a monster and now they see how it could affect their own kids and it's very addictive to the parents\nI Would talk to the parents at the school I'd say don't you want you you know to are you concerned about this because they could access porn and everything and\nAnd the parents seemed clueless they were so addicted to it yeah they wanted their kids to get on a family plan so they could save money and I I just couldn't even talk to the other parents and that was just like I was alone for\nI think I think things are changing Lisa here this is from this ah another article in today's New York times of dark consensus about screens and kids begins to emerge in Silicon valley\nAnd uh in this one uh uh uh the ... or a shovel vierra\nWho worked as an executive assistant at Facebook and is now at ... stolen tropic arm the ... initiative said quote I Am convinced the devil lives in our phones excuse me in his wreaking havoc on our children\nChris Anderson former editor at wired you know the big tech magazine is now the chief executive of robotics company\nAnd founded a website and geek dad dot com he said on a scale he's talking about cell phones and kids uses a scale between candy and crack cocaine\nIt's closer to crack cocaine you said we thought we could control it but this is beyond our power to control this was going straight to the pleasure centers of the developing brain this is beyond our capacity as regular parents to understand he's got he's got five kids\nAnd a twelve tech rules and his rules including no phones until the summer before high school no screens

hundred eight five six seven fifty\nFive [noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back here with you and\nI'm Marcia in Tustin, California a Marcia it says here you want to disagree\nOn Hi Tom ... I'm Sorry [laughter] that's all right um I Want to\nTake a little bit of an exception with the computers and the program and we watch our seven year old very closely as to what he watches and he gets involved in and you're right kind of those games are very addictive but after the school he involved in a program called ...\nAnd all the kids are on it and it takes their own own rage that kid is only having he's reading and second grade level\nI mean it can ... kind of vocabulary this kid has\nBeen the case if he just had and good instruction on paper and pencil I'm not saying that that computers are necessarily terrible things I mean\nIf you heard the call or you know during the break there when I was talking is I'm forgetting her name now um you know she was talking about she had a disabled child and for him you know fine motor coordination using a drawing programs on a tablet is a really good thing and I'm like yeah that makes perfect sense but that's a whole different thing than the crack cocaine you get from social media\nUm huh yeah I agree\nThat ... you know I get a little upset when people said he wanted to take the cabinet to lay totally and all that because I have seen this child who is ... and the kids around then who are learning and an ... grade and they said\nWell that's a good thing I mean it in order to know that it's the computers you'd have to compare it to a comparable school with a comparable can you know comparable kids of socio economic background Oregon\nAnd and and I don't think that any of those studies have been done but uh check out a Marcy a there is a an article by Nelly balls in today's New York times is titled in digital gap between rich and poor kids is not what we expected and what they're finding is that in in middle income and low income neighborhoods\nMore and more public schools are doing more and more screen time and in many cases they are doing it because companies are coming in and selling it to them\nAnd charging them for the programs for the software and helping them move fundraising drives and things to get the computers or the or in some schools the parents are affluent enough to provide the kids with schools or with the computers are the schools are affluent enough um but there's a there's a profit motive here too\nAnd whereas in the upper ... upper middle class and very upper class schools and and some of the very best prep schools in the country now are banning computers altogether\nThey're just saying no well\nYeah they probably have the ability to actually provide children I'm more shall I say strongly that it\nWas ... yeah they probably have a you know for to wander eight to one student teacher ratio rather than forty to one like in a public school you're right and I\n... yeah ... ... what I see from my at the end and I I'm a great grandmother and and this is my great grandfather on my reading and I raise kids you know who have gone to school with no computers at all and the\nThe speed with which fifth child is learning is just blowing me over that's how he is and it's amazing yeah\nHell I don't know I I kind of I can watch I'm Glad to get social\nYeah I'm Glad it's a good experience for you I I get I'd I'd do caution you to be very very careful about social media that's the big thing Marcy a thank you for the call a neighbor in San Rafael animator what's up\nA good morning I'm On a very glad to be on your program and be able to\nJust want to actually uh talk about the previous caller just wait till that child is Thirteen fourteen years old things will change and the video game will change and they will get more\nAggressive about wanting to play and uh you can't stop it at all and hours and hours go by and I wanted to ask you there is a lot of talk about yeah this is addictive it's definitely addictive\nAnd it's not good for the kids as they go to the teenage years it's a waste of their time they're not socializing we get all that what are you supposed to do with the parents of the four year old who taller than I Am\nAnd uh you know those days are gone that I could just go in his room and unplug it and tell them no no more you know you have to go eat your dinner now what am I get to do what are we supposed to do\nI I don't know they are I mean the the the one thing that I've seen a fair amount of and in fact the apple just built it into the most recent operating system for their phones I pads is you can can figure your ear device so that there's no color in it so it's entirely black and white and gray and that\nAppears to have a really significant impact in the in the in ... in reducing our addictive um both some types of social media and many video games and things like that are\nUm and and of course about you know there are there are programs in ways that you can limit what Web sites they can go to and that kinda stuff I mean you know blocking software has been around forever it was first shoes for pornography but most kids can figure out I had around that but the color thing um that that seems to be something that there's a growing consensus about\nBut the other thing I suppose that are as you know ... and just like with anything else sitting down with your kid and having a conversation about it\nAnd talking about you know this this this could be dangerous stuff I mean it's like the conversation you have a you know about sexuality is the conversations you have about how do you treat your friends it's a you know this this is this is this has got to be the new area where parents and kids are are communicate with each other it seems to me\nWhat about government a government tells us you can drive your child\nDid not driving them to the they had a drink and those are the only one about that one of mine recently by you know we were having a\nDebate back in the sixties seventies and eighties around television especially after the color television became ubiquitous six and I'm I'm old enough to remember that and uh I think there was a broad consensus that we really don't want the government regulating that sort of thing\nOur kids although we wouldn't mind if the government paid for the research and tell us what to\nDo and they are thanks for the call [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to um [noise]\nThe big question is this how our strategic investors like you who are paying

hope\nAnd change lives with a family in your community\nNow that now\nBuilt it is it had a cat died or\nPresidential visit I might marks while\nHe'll sign an executive order this basically a proclamation proclaim that this was not a good thing\nWhy is this the the news\nI mean if you want to have a serious movement to amend the fourteenth amendment that's okay with me frankly and I were one of thirty countries that has birthright citizenship\nIf you're born on the soil of the country you are a citizen or the ... in a country there's ... there's only ... but there's thirty countries that have this I don't think that we have to have it\nI'm fine with coming up with a different system let's have a conversation about what a shit what it should be you know shouldn't be like Canada should it be like England should it be like like uh France says\nI mean you know with other countries that don't have birthright citizenship\nBut if you're going to do that with the fourteenth amendment I'd like to make one other suggestion\nCorporate personhood\nIs based on the fourteenth amendment in the modern interpretation of it is based on the fourteenth amendment case was brought before the Supreme Court usa Supreme Court and Eighteen eighty six or the title Santa Clara county versus southern Pacific railroad I wrote a book about this case it's called on equal protection of corporations became people\nAnd the argument that was made by the railroads was that they should have constitutional rights they should be considered persons under the law\nBecause the fourteenth amendment doesn't say natural persons\n... you know is that no person she'll be denied equal protection of laws though is the phrase as I recall the fourteenth I don't have in front of me but that's my recollection of what it says no person she'll be denied equal protection under the law and of course what they meant was\nNo black person I mean these were the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments were passed and slavery\nSo that's what the writers meant\nBut a generation later with the railroads argued was because that doesn't say natural person says two kinds of persons that law there is a natural person there's an artificial person and artificial person's a corporation and government a church or natural person as you and me because it doesn't say natural person includes us we're persons to\nWhich by the way is legally true goes all the way back to Blackstone you know back to the Fifteen sixteen hundreds\nAnd so if we're going to amend the fourteenth amendment\nLet the right wing or take birthright citizenship out and for me put the word natural before the word person in the provision about equal protection under the law\nI'm okay with that but the bottom line is this is just this is just Trump doing his thing\nAnd I don't know how you know what else to call it\nI just I just published a piece you can find it a over at both common dreams and on altering at\nA different titles but there and it's probably will pop up on a few other sites as the day goes on um the independent media Institute now syndicates my writing\n[noise] and I point out you know it's already started\nThey are texting messaging tweeting even call into the show\nBreitbart has bragging that they got it on CNN what am I talking about oh this is this is the quote I used to it's it's kind of a a I linked to a Breitbart the so it's kind of an iguana ration of these things and actually\nThere were several of these on my Twitter feed last night\nAnd quote this killing in Pittsburgh has nothing to do with Donald Trump is not an anti Semite is daughter can learn and Judaism and his grandkids are Jews how can you blame him for that mentally ill guy\nMentally ill of course because he's a white guy right set of calling him a terrorist or a murderer\nBut the reality is that it does have something to do with Donald Trump as I mentioned yesterday I talked about this yesterday that that I don't think this is getting anywhere near enough coverage in the media\nThat he was going after a congregation the the tree of life synagogue vet was part of it was it was one of the two hundred and Seventy synagogues around the United states and twenty three states who were participating in this national refugee ... bought\nWhere they were or this is with ah the Hebrew immigrant aid society high ass\nIt was October Nineteen and twenty as of this year and they they on their website they listen to all these places and the this is a you know I'm not going to name him this this\nAnd I almost said something you can't say on the air uh [laughter] I've done this this terrorist this killer\nThis murderer this vicious vials despicable piece of stealing crap this guy\nWent highest announced\nOn their website that they were having this\nRefugee ... by\nAnd they listed in this synagogue\nAmong the other ones which was apparently near where this guy lives he actually responded to the\nYou know open your eyes it's filthy evil Jews bringing the fifth wheel filthy evil Muslims into our country\nAnd then he he uh\nA explicitly\nI'm looking for the quote here highest likes to bring invaders in that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch by people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nAnd he went in guns blazing\nAnd meanwhile Newt and Trump and Fox are going all day all the\nTime you know those those brown people\nFrom South of the border there on their way or no this was going to be a terrible\nThing we got all freak out we got all these scared all this kind of

freak out thing\nOr the so called migrants caravan and ah you know the this is a apparently what provoked this fellow who did the shooting in Pittsburgh now yes you know specifically referenced it I've\nGot an article about that over both an alternate in common dreams right now you can people get rate if they want all the links and everything [noise]\nUm so what's the latest on this\nWell I checked in on the location of this caravan today which is in the tiny little town of ... which is by my calculation on Google\nMaps which offers a walking directions leader is uh about nine hundred and thirty miles from the U.S border this group is walking at less than twenty miles\nA day remember again that are about a third of the people in this group our children are so not surprising you're not covering you know fifty miles a day by foot as a ... pretty slow pace they are probably about ...\nDays fifty days away when the border is the I think a pretty conservative\nCalculation I Do want to pull up some fast though that I've been crunching here just to put for um the this these numbers of people in scale because I think I'm One of the big a sort of messages coming from the White House the justifying this military deployment fifty two hundred troops heading to the\nSouthern border is that this group of people is going to overwhelm\nExisting facilities in December of last year at all of the border crossings in Texas I was able to pull up from customs and border patrol day of the number of ... people in trucks or buses are trained or something crossing the border but then the people who arrived on foot\nYou had one point five two million people cross Texan border crossings to Mexico and back in December of last year which is when they are scheduled to arrive this year that's forty nine thousand or so people a day so again this notion that a group of two thousand people if\nYou actually have two thousand people reach the border which passed caravans statistics\nDon't suggest is going to be likely is not going to in any way overwhelm a the American border patrol facilities I also pull up a really interesting graph which I can I'll I'll retreat on Twitter in a second and and your listeners can check it out of my page\nUm which is a restaurant and the number of migrants apprehensions per border patrol agent per year at the U.S Mexico border have data going back to the\nNineteen nineties um around that Nineteen Ninety three the average border patrol agent is I'm a apprehending three hundred and fifty two migrants per year almost one a day um but ten years later two thousand three that's down to Ninety two so you're about four times lower\nNow per year the estimate for twenty Eighteen is that the average border patrol agent will intercept\nTwenty three people over the course of a whole year so once again I'm their workload is much lower than it's been almost at any point in recent history and so to suggest a you know a backup needs to be frantically called in I think is an exaggeration\nAnd finally let's point out one important fact which is that the last time you've had armed to a military stationed at the southern border was Nineteen Ninety seven\nYou know what happened then you ... do you remember it probably more than I Do you had an Eighteen year old American citizen who was hurting goats\nShot and killed by four members of an elite marine squandered who were in a heavy camouflage camping out is if they were you know in some a war zone and this kid was carrying a pistol he shot it took more off a predator was near the sheep\nThe Marines took that as a threat evidently and kill them about you know basically sniper shock this guy and that led to the secretary of defense to mandate a that us a armed military personnel and not be allowed to conduct border patrols and not be actually allowed to carry weapons\nAt all this is now being revised and so we are inheriting a military uh you know a personnel who have I think shown themselves at times to not at all really possessed the right\nUh you know skills to be able to perform asylum responsibilities and the careful work of a intercepting migrants to to the status\nI think you know we're we're sending us our theater for the election um are we just have a minute left low pay Iranian TV says they have a ... or they know why as your mall ... was was murdered what's what's the deal\nSo press TV and are actually building off of a report from the Sunday Express which was a British papers actually they're the ones doing the original reporting here they say they have a friend of ... who came to them saying that could show he was about to obtain documentary evidence\nOf the Saudi Government using chemical weapons in the war\nIn Yemen now there

elected even though they didn't like him and I think that's true in this case as well [noise]\nUm but yeah he's much worse and you know Brazil is only had a democracy for you know thirty something years and\nShow it had to pay to ship before that and the institutions are relatively weak we saw that it was a weakness of the Democratic institutions actually and the way they were destroyed by not only the right but the center\nThe so called center that gave us both now and I think that's very important 'cause you don't see that so much in the news but you know both in our came to power because they impeached Dilma the elected president in two thousand sixteen [noise]\nWithout even charging her with an actual crime and then because Lula da Silva the former president for two terms uh from two thousand two to two thousand three two thousand eleven because\nHe was the most popular politician in the country and would've defeated both in our very easily\nUh he was thrown into jail\nAnd then prohibited from running for president even though the you a un human rights commission said that he had to be allowed to run and then they cut him off from media as well so he couldn't say things to the\nPoint is the way this was the courts and that was what the right it did a again this was with a pack\nOf course the way that the way that Mitch McConnell's doing or an ...\nYou used the judiciary to go after the PTA and the Workers Party that is why they were able it was all organized to win what they couldn't win at the ballot box in\nAfter four elections in which the workers' party won\nSo this was a coup and then it was again the political persecution of look and the center uh such as it is in Brazil well this may set her party was a salute Brazilian social democratic party they're the ones that ran against ... and DOMA and the previous elections\nAnd then uh they created this monster because people went with a ... where you have some similarity to Trump because they thought they saw him as an outsider\nAnd in the case of Brazil because the media had spent sixteen years demonizing the workers' party and pretending as though it was the center of corruption in Brazil when in reality\nIt was just a party that had some uh corruption like all the other parties ... certainly less\nAnd but the media convince people that this was the party that was responsible for corruption and then allowed ... to campaign as the person who would clean it up\nNow it's genuinely right wing governments\nI mean you know of a fascist to governments\nUm sometimes actually take care of their people in order to maintain power you know Hitler mostly both in the\nUh I don't know about Franco or expand it actually the social safety net in many regards\nOn the other hand in in central and South America what we've seen is that when these conservative governments take over a and and you know feel feel free to fill in the areas where I'm my knowledge on this is very gray but it seems like this has been the case in Central America\nUnder us Nicaraguan El Salvador\nThat they do things like cutting back on the social safety net cutting back on education cutting back on healthcare cutting back on Social Security\nOr in order to be able to transfer more wealth so the very wealthy people ah who basically are the ones who are supporting the right wing governments and then you get these the basically revolts and you know refugees and and disasters and all these kinds of things\nI'm a is that a reasonable analysis and B if that's the case do you think that that's the direction the balls and I was going to go in Brazil and might that then turn turn into the thing the bite so\nWell you have right wing authoritarian populist governments in the past that did fairly well economically but that was in the sixties and seventies since the Nineteen eighties you can't really point to any populist right wing or right wing government of any kind\nA that really did you know improve people's living standards\nShow I think you know and and then you don't have to look just at history you can look at both NARAL himself and who he's appointed for his finance minister and the economic policies that the ah\nThat his team is proposing and those will definitely lower living standards I mean they want to cut pensions for example\nA show that's gonna be a big bite because a lot of families live off of public pensions in just a necessarily one person and of course he's going to destroy he's going to attack unions and the the ...\nUnless workers whom he wants to kill them basically pretty much said he's going to the you know he told the left you can either leave the country or go to jail so yeah he's going to weaken labor he's going to weaken and repressed violently the social movements\nUh and so he will a ... and he will cut the budget you know he he's a ... you know the the present government has already been cutting spending for\nPrograms like both familiar which is the program that pull people out of\nPoverty in the countryside under DOMA so yeah he's going to go all the way and in that sense you can't really call him a popular even Trump whose is fake a populist as\nYou can almost imagine he did so far stick to his promise of not cutting Social Security and Medicare which is how he distinguished himself from the other Republican candidates and fuzzy evil to pose as a popular\nYou don't even have that uh when it comes right now or ...\nRemarkable absolutely remarkable out\n... and just just for the record from Trump's budget wise but it actually did cut some of those Social Security and Medicare didn't cut the benefits of the people but it cut the administration to the staff and others are going to degrade services\nBut excellent

here [noise]\nYes indeed geeky science it is even a ... a speaking science alert here brought to you by the way by my new book last hours of ancient suddenly I was just released in third edition with all kinds of updated information on a climate change all that kinda stuff so you can check that out\nOver a world well wherever you get your books\nHere's here's the science or even a ten minute walk may be good for the brain this by Gretchen rituals and in rentals in this week's New York times ten minutes of mild almost ... exercise like taking a walk right can immediately alter how certain parts of the brain communicate and coordinate with one another\nAnd improve memory function according to an encouraging new neurological study the findings suggest that exercise does not need to be prolonged or intent to benefit the brain\nAnd that the effects can begin far more quickly than many of us expect\nHim so this is a the studies that they did on mice and rats they found that they develop new brain cells\nOr when they do when they a run on the treadmills rather than remaining sedentary many of those new cells are clustered in the hippocampus that's the part of the brain that that does short term memory and storage or the active animals also perform better on tests of learning and memory and they've now a extended this to people\nSo it's pretty cool\nAnd that there's that and then the second when you get a two for here on the on the geeky science the second one is a humanity has wiped out sixty percent of the animal populations since Nineteen Seventy\nOh this is not so much good news because of what it means is that we are destroying the Web of life that supports us\nThis is a new study that was done by fifty nine scientists around the globe and wrote and produced by the world worldwide low Wildlife Federation\nThe WWF and\nWhat they found was the consumption of food and resources by the global human population is destroying the Web of life which was billions of years in the making upon which human society ultimately Japan's for clean air water and everything else\nAnd they said this is my beret the executive director of science and conservation WWF he says if there's a sixty percent decline in the human population that'd be equivalent to empty in North America South America Africa Europe China and Oceana\nThat is the scale of all we have done to the non human animals on this planet\nIs it as more there's far more than just about losing the wonders of nature of this is actually now jeopardizing the future of people nature is that something nice to have nature is our life support system\nOther research now says reveal that humankind has destroyed eighty three percent of all mammals and half of the world's plants since the dawn of civilization\nAnd then even if we stopped killing everything now\nIt would take seven million years for the world to recover\nThe biggest cause of this wildlife a is wildlife losses the destruction natural habitat to create fat farmland or killing for food is the second biggest cause three hundred mammal species are being eaten into extinction\nChemical pollution is significant half the world's killer whale populations are now doomed to die from PCB contamination\nAnd it's being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy which is being exported to countries to feed pigs and chickens\nWe want to get healthy become become a vegan\nChris in Oakland, California and Chris what's on your mind that at\nThe time Richard was really closer wasn't me I was rooting for him it was
