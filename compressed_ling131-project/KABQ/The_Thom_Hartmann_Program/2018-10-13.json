year ago hence the name yeah hence the name you know the badger state\nBadger honey badger course so adventurous studio it's my ...\nI have a lot of a deal slow on my desk and job availability job opportunities that come across my desk that I usually refer out a lot and I just decided you know I'm\nI'm I'm collecting myself from the fray of the whole year you know twenty Seventeen and I'm working at start ups for a number of years and just trying to cool off a bit [noise] um but at\nThe University of telling me there's tons of people\nWho who need to be inspired the way I was back when I first found out about you know when I first took the plants to learn about it and they're ready they're ready now and never structure is much you know the industry and the infrastructure mature to the point where can handle\nYou know more people and there's a hundred thousand approximately available jobs in the space so out um so yeah I I I can cure a talent in uh the mid west in Madison, Wisconsin specifically which is where I live now and\nFind creative spine developers engineers technical people I'm legal\nLegal people uh who wanted exposure to this even just a moonlight in it and I can give them that exposure mhm so I build the teams around some of the projects that come on my desk and and people\nKind of you and they they are you kind of helping people find help basically is that what you're doing\nSo I find freelancers who has skills are programmers programmers and ... and creative marketers copy writers um you know again like a business developers are legal professionals and\nThey come become aware of them because uh you know they come through different co working space is that I frequent in Madison or something and we you know you never find out about them and place them with the opportunity so you're kind of like a head hunter but not really\nWell I Want it to be a home for them so we have our own projects and I encourage people to like work on those but yeah if uh if I'm able to bid for a contract for some consulting work\nI'll need to build the team around that to provide the service so Al Al ... the talent for the team and be able to kind of manage it or just oversee it and let the talented people become leaders in the industry and in most people only need three weeks maybe three months\nOf exposure to this content to realize they can apply their skill somewhere and so that's I I Want us to be that care about them\nAnd you're specifically focusing on people regionally like people in the Wisconsin\nPredominantly yeah that's where I looked first but again we have freelancers from all over the world do okay in of course\nPeople who are native to Wisconsin maybe you don't live there anymore or people who went to school at U. W. and don't live there any more of course I'm it's great to have that kind of local a local culture involved and my idea is that um we're going to dry and a lot of\nEconomic value from outside of our region sure and that's going to go in and make people's lives better and maybe make the community and you know the town better city better awesome\nSo uh it's badger labs I was asking if there's a website there apparently isn't one so you're really knowing where people were kind of felt the we have some projects that we're trying to keep a little bit low key I'm doing some really cool things with the lightning network\nAnd um yeah so there will be ... very soon and there will be more announcements and we'll be talking about anything that\nYou were talking about like you know like what would you want to reveal to our audience and a very short time\nI think uh you know of course\nI'm all the chains have a you know have an application for certain people you know use them in different ways I gravitated to lightning I think that's where a lot of the interesting um energy is\nRight now and the lightning is a future kind of here now but sort of futuristic products are coming onto the bitcoin watching we talk more about uh can you hang out with those guys are segment that's ... with us here from ... labs and this is talk live whereas the free state black change digital assets conference yesterday we talked about working with\nHappier much after she had really no\nShe is a hundred and five pounds of shiny happy dog for life the shedding stuff she stopped\nSince two thousand and one we've helped more than a quarter million dogs get over their nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers billions and vet bills\nAnd we try to come to die to buy for how you know\nIf you got to see that kind of how I got three fatty I think the guy that are cut out a regular dog is Tricia dying to fight for life\nLet your dog it's scratch bank or said like crazy competed either by for help\nEight eight eight five nine four one K.\nWants more profitable running your business or doing bookkeeping doing your business of course but you want to keep your book so that you can maximize your tax savings right what if I told you that there is a person that's a book keeper accountant and law school graduate that's also a hardcore libertarian\nMy name is Melanie Johnson and I hate the state I Will aggressively help you to minimize your tax exposure to maximize profits all well staying within the law\nMelanie is your best choice for your taxes and bookkeeping needs gonna tax free talk live dot com and check out our website tax free chocolate dot com\nThen cash has changed their name to her rise into better represent\nTheir transition from a crypto currency to a pioneering platform that protects consumers data they're working towards the day when anyone will be able to build privacy based applications on the horizon platform unique smelling of her rise then as a nod to their heritage and recognizes that they remain committed to the vision that our project was built upon their quaint and ticker symbol remain the e and\nLearn more at her rise in global enjoying the horizon community H.

live is Joel ...\nWho is here with us I Want to bring him on and just a moment but I also want to let you know about the blink home security system you want to talk about ineffective affordable system you actually do get both of those things in one package or with Lincoln is thanks to Amazon they bought the company they liked the product so much and so now blink works with Alexa these are wireless\nDevices you get the cameras you one box popped the batteries in and you put them up wherever you want them in your house and that's it you set it up with your wife financial device and literally you're done\nWithin moments after having open up the box it's really interesting and it works very well of course you get to decide when the cameras are operating unity one I'm just on at night do you want while you're away from our way to work or whatever\nAnd then when something moves in front of the camera it send you a clip that you receive on your smart device wherever it is that you happen to be\nSo good to blink protect dot com slash F deal and you'll say Fifteen Percent off the already affordable blink comes security system that's blink protects dot com slash F T L like free talk live by the way there's no contracts and do subscriptions\nAnd so we get blink is an Amazon company\nSo Chris here in our remote studio in Portsmouth out here doing bonus a extra interviews we just had so many great people to talk to we filled up two full days of content\nDay three yeah I Know and and it's it's like a man or from having a every five minutes somebody goes by and I'm like\nOh we've got to talk to them just like dashed back is like ... from heaven where you can actually spend a dash in real life\nIn New Hampshire and actually received dashed back to well balanced whale or a big fan of dash you do a lot with the dash crypto currency I think it was yesterday shall we had there and tap or no sorry was our first are ferocious a Wednesday night we had Darren tap on a who's more into the technical math side\nOf things and you're out there you're in the streets you're promoting you're you're getting out there you're going to conferences or you're going to local businesses what else are you doing with dash these days\nYes so I'm Still the ... the chief editor of the worst news which is the the only as far as I Know dashed dedicated news outlet in the world and we're starting to do a lot of big foray into PR outreach for example getting into major publications such as going to ask and we've gotten a couple of Forbes articles lately to\nBuy one of our colleagues purchase as us\nThat's awesome uh yeah somebody actually the radio station that were running ads\nOn in Keene now the talk station in Qena running ads promoting the bitcoin embassy my sales guy saw that in Forbes and sent me a sales guy at the radio station sent me an email saying hey I think you'd like to see this and I hadn't seen it yet so so it's definitely a getting around out there\nUm and you mentioned dash ... news you also hosts a podcast a gentleman\nUh that is called that force news three and he goes podcast\nIt precisely and that is what once a week every every Friday at three PM eastern\nAlso available on A L R and D on FM as part of our regular rotation of great uh liberty oriented podcast so ah Chris yeah I Know that you wanted to talk about you know bringing business owners on board with with crypto currency it's something that we all have experience in\nUm you've been downtown famously on CNN actually you know purchasing for businesses are here in uh in Portsmouth and so you know what it's like being there and interacting with these merchants and sometimes things go wrong and there's some bumps in the road but you got to bring him on and the first place\nUm and we're seeing a huge adoption of dash in Venezuela where Caracas we talked earlier it was yesterday I don't think you were here for our panel but we had a panel\nWhere it was people from Ken in Fort Smith talking about why New Hampshire's the crypto mecca and why people who are into crypto currency ought to come here and help augment and make bigger and more effective the already very effective movement that we have because Portsmouth in Qena are the number one and two cities from what I can tell per capita\nAs far as uh crypto currency adoptions first use in businesses in real life Caracas, Venezuela is number three\nAnd they have way more than raw numbers they've got like over a thousand I as from what I've heard taking dash uh but uh if you do per capita actually Portsmouth thinking actually beat Caracas but crowded Los or not\nEither way it's a I Believe they're there they're going to ... to ... thousand that's accepting businesses in Venezuela okay as of now called all of that we're all in a Caracas accounts for a more than over Fifteen hundred sober for I\nI don't remember the population of the city it's over a million yeah but so it's I think it's the oldest two it's still it's getting close to where we we will have\nThat as the highest density unless it's going to happen yeah yeah it's probably going to happen unless we get off our liberty loving booties and well they actually get anything done over here well I mean we are getting things done\nI must say for instance there's there's ... there's levels to those games and figure I thought that we were the hardcore people but then do people with an actual hunger for ... literally literally hunger right\nAnd so I experienced this ... problems you mean they can't open a bag I found out All right right and I've experienced this firsthand drive is a dispensary and California recently\nAnd you go up to the top of the stairs and there's a couple of armed guards there one of them right to demand your ID the other one's swipes ... we we we have to see if the well the actor oh yeah the ... and then they let you in the dispensary they've got a vote with cash and the ... yes and then I and then they let you in the dispensary at which point\nYou go round the date him right there in the dismissed and then you get the ... the cash out and then you can go to the counter and actually pay and it's ... it's\nI I they're ... they're doing their best\nBut it's it's it's a problem and so I understand when they say cash handling fees are Fifteen to thirty percent for the cannabis industry it's like ... like I say I know it it it is insane I thought so um\nBut you have to see why where the money go away money goes to this security otherwise you'd just Rob it so\nBut then I realized I started looking at some CBD um some CBD sellers on line and I noticed that a lot of them they just I didn't even ... target for that is a lot of them\nExcept cryptic currencies and a lot of her actually offered discounts like and of course I'm just always on the Internet looking for stuff always looking at ... accepting business is always trying to get more and this kind of struck me I'm like why why would\nI thought a CBD\nIs legal in the U.S and hadn't doesn't have these problems well it turns out as an other problems associated with the ... at a banking system\nCharge backs right in this industry the fitness supplement industry has a huge problem will charge backs are among buys diet pills it didn't work yeah they and then they take it and they just they wake up next day I'm Still fat and one of the only thing\nAnd then there's this ... it's automatic back in the merchant can't do anything and that is a giant chunk of business so they're willing to actually subsidize\nPeople's pay hanging crypto currency because you can actually reverse yeah they look like insurance he'd rather pay a certain amount of money to reduce the risk of that giant chunk of money going away and said he realized okay\nHere's another with is actually ... money saved is not well maybe this or censorship that are but what about cypress in the hair cut and all those you know forget all that stuff let's talk about how every single day not ... not worst case scenario at work today and the answer is overwhelmingly yes\nAnd um we we are business did that almost from day one it was a little bit in but we quickly realized that you know we would rather have people pay were crypto than anything else\nSo yeah let's do five percent discount you've come in our store anything you buy any hyped up ... percent off of any crypto\nA which means I've sometimes accepted some\nLess than desirable corrupt those but that was my polling you'll take it you really will take anything how I Will say can I get paid on does going I've got paid and I'm going to take those those are All right I don't know if I'm going to take the stuff I've never heard of a trade and raven going yet ... yes he did last night ... bam there we go I did I got fired\nI when I'm not even I don't know you and say what you sold because it might not that might be admitting to something you don't want to tell my gosh\nYes [laughter] I Can't do that\nCan't do that [laughter] well do you and after that meant something very insignificant yeah sold for a good amount of raven coin yeah that I likely violated several federal laws and doing so so oh\n... I wouldn't go that far I don't know what you're talking about but I still would write out far ... you'll be surprised when you hear that and you at home we'll never know\nAnd people don't have the verification process or other things and another ...\nWhen you start thinking things through the crypto lens of criminals better the banking system the payments industry is not as good once they're thinking that let me start seeing things like\nOne more time in California I Am going outside of a brew I Love craft beers at a brewery went outside there's a ... we've got a brewery that takes dash now that's what I hear you know you can't keep me away so I there was a\nMexican taco truck there uh and with with like good like seafood tacos and ... a big sign their\nCash you know non cake cash or credit card or a five percent of shark oh here it was just well sometimes under a certain amount no nothing ... period you know why because\nThey have to then pay people\nPay their employees many of whom probably don't have legal status I mean I'm trying to get some ... maybe you took a or suppliers who don't necessarily have bank access to the financial system because they don't have official documentation that proves that they are here for them and a half ... yes it's much easier for them to have cash than to\nTake us take a swipe and then withdraw or to a bank transfer they just want to do their accounting straight in cash and writer actually willing to do that now if they took that cryptic currency\nThey would probably I Would say if I got that convinced that I could probably get them to five percent discount and crypto currency has they have all the ... of the whole thing right to have those tears it a bit yeah like you do cash for cash prize five percent offer crypto and if you want to do with a credit card five percent more yeah that school all the benefits of credit cards\nNone of the problems of credit card right except for you know you need a machine to work as opposed to just given our paper we thought that something happened a sort of related to this in Keene\nOctober first a little ... pizza which you know if you've been to the porcupines festival they haven't taken crypto for a couple of years and they decided to stop taking credit cards entirely they made an announcement on there or Instagram and their social media picture of hey we're done we're you know this October first were quitting\nAnd you know right below that there was an immediate conversation about we are accepting cash and crypto currency and there were a couple of customers who immediately posted like I guess I'm gonna have to learn about crypto currency now or whatever so\nCool yes which so far I mean there's a bunch of ways of getting crypto currency probably if you're in New Hampshire and more so than yeah right the easiest one stop shop sort of thing is getting account with uphold and then you just find so easily and pretty easy to get on and I got us it's the it's the easiest one thing I can recommend\nAs a personal account business account was a little bit more ... on our home I've had a customer service is basically nonexistent so that I wasn't real happy with a but regardless it's been working fine as a personal and I think you said there are limits were like ten thousand dollars per some beer a day or whatever and it went up\nTo them like that it was very high much higher than big yeah and um it it one thing you should should know about Apple's first off they do give favor I Believe the lowest\nUm the lowest charge for kept a currency conversion would be big coined beauties one point oh five year old ... point nine five when nine five dash is the second is at one point two five okay ... much others are one point for still very very far from you heard was murdered yes if you wanted to compare\n... if you include ... uh the actual currency transaction fees therefore that has the best deal also there are some rumors that upper will be directly integrated into several dash wallets so then\nSomeone can just download a dash ... and get that from the exact same map out well that'll be cool so there's all kinds of things happening with ... a Venezuela is hot uh we're\nDefinitely keeping an eye on that situation down there and I hope to we're going to have you back on at some point John with with my race in a little while back as co host\nAnd hopefully we might put it in another ... proposal this month so we'll see we'll keep outlandish drives me up they don't know how that goes ah Joel thanks for coming back on TALK live from

N. dot global so are you were\nKind of rattling off a Chris some of the names of the Web sites are at websites pages\nBeing taken down by Facebook\nDid you have a few more you wanted to highlight there was what complicates those are the ones that I ... I've heard of\n'em now there's there's others here but I Wonder what other sites were taking down outside of the libertarian around because surely there were a large number right they said five hundred fifty nine pages two hundred and fifty one personal account looks like they were targeting conservatives um just\nJust from the looks of it um it was worse libertarians aren't conservative no I'm a but like anything that was anti government\nService art and science government and the government on let's jump into the ... blog post and yeah you know talk about this ah so it says people need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook\nIt's why we have a policy banning coordinated inauthentic behavior and then they define that briefly by saying networks have accounts or pages working to mislead others about who they are and what they're doing\nThis year we've been forced to say against many pages groups and the couch created to stir up political debate including in the U.S the middle east Russia and the u._k. but the bulk of the an authentic behavior on Facebook is spam that's typically motivated by money not politics and the people behind it\nOr a ... totally yeah this is this is just or do the scientists that are taller than it is yeah hosted the whole building is politically has nothing to do with what they're claiming it they're using they're using like certain words as to to make it sound like you're more likely that yeah\nThat's how you write a sentence what he's saying they're trying to think of what you're saying is they're trying to appeal to whoever it is the reading at a certain type of ... apso if there are just about money these pages there miss what was misrepresenting who they are and what they stand for what was the\nLike two sentences ago these pages or misrepresented are working to mislead others about who they are and what they are doing a look cop block is certainly not misleading anybody about what they do yeah and then they've got a very clear mission right but\nSo let's go on a continuing on and they say and the people behind it that being the an authentic behavior and are adapting their behavior as our enforcement improves\nOne common type of spam has been post that hot fraudulent products like sake sunglasses or weight loss remedies\nBut a lot of the ... I'm not coming from ... to hopefully not a again\nRight five hundred pages or yeah or one common type of spam again the hawking products but a lot of the ... that we see today is different the people behind that create networks of pages using fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same name\nThey post click bait on these pages and drive people to the Web sites that are entirely separate from Facebook and seem legitimate oh actually add farms\nThey don't like it when somebody leaves Facebook so they're saying oh these pages are cetera mark as though that you know a negative on here\nRight and you know a lot of people have known for a while that Facebook is\nTrying to get people to stay with in the face built right goes to they will tell you I Want to be on Instagram that spy that's part of our family but there are some people I call them idiots who have the Instagram account because Facebook violates my privacy\n[laughter] they they exist said penalize a pope posted do not right to Facebook so if you just linked to the free thought project or cop locked out or they will down sort of penalize that and it won't be seen by you know as many ...\nWhat some of these pages have done and I'm not going to say all five hundred and fifty pages in two hundred and fifty what a couch but a a segment of them they as they said here they have a great it so the anti media post something yeah\nThis activity goes against what people expect on Facebook and violates our policies against ...\n... to claim okay so if it's true and they do obviously aren't going to prove their claim here right they don't they're not going to show any evidence because again they hit eight hundred or whatever five hundred something pages\nUm but if it's true that top block or the free thought project\nWas using ... armies of fake users or hiring a you know some India Company in India with a bunch of people sitting in a boiler room or just clicking like some things or whatever 'cause you can do that right or that so if they were actually doing that which I highly doubt because let me tell ya ... block\nA basically had no budget ... when it was sold or buy a demo Freeman to the highest bidder and we still don't know who that person is the site continues to operate I still have an\nActive blogging account there so I still have the ability to post on top locked out or in fact if you go to that site you'll see the last five posts were from me nobody else has been posting their\nUm you know I'm just sort of try and I don't know what I'm trying to keep the flame alive to rise to some but I remember talking with a team of Freeman about the site when he was selling it when I found out he was selling it I I talk to him I said well hey man why don't you come to us and you know ask us if\nWe wanted to buy it because he said well everybody who was active with decide 'cause I was never really that active with it right or he said everybody was active with the site they turned it down\nAnd and so he gave me some details at that time about like revenue from advertising in\nThe state barely paid it's hosting bill right so they didn't have like a bunch of money or even a little bit of money to go and you know go to five or or wherever it is you hire these you know fake likes cause I Know that you can get them on line and you can you know pay somebody and then somehow whether it be through some kind of a script\nOr actually have some you know Nigerian guy in a room somewhere clicking creating new accounts and clicking legs on things or whatever\nYou can get these things but I don't buy for a second the claim that caught by any other crazy thing is that it's it's it's basically as you said it's been dead for six months at least\nI mean since the ... I mean it was sold the ages ago is there though the Facebook wasn't dead a demo sold the Facebook to someone else actually so somebody bought the website but before that\nA demo had sold off or a book and after that\nHappened the Facebook or for ... started to promote another police accountability page which is fine you know whatever hey\nIt's an old brand you got a new brand you by the old brand up and use it to promote your New Britain that that makes sense yeah um so I just wanted to be clear that even though the site itself wasn't a that content creating the Facebook page purportedly why not that I was following it because again I haven't been on Facebook\nRight and I do know that there are people that will share things in or attempt to share them in every group there in ... and I would share only in their groups I thought they were appropriate for but I was sharing more than one group ... there was a candidate and I'm not going to specify\nIn what state or for what office but there's a libertarian candidate that I Know\nThat he posted a few days ago that his\nPrivileges of posting in groups was restricted for twenty four hours because he tried sharing the same post in every group he was\nIn ... and you know there are things\nYou have if you a post too often that Facebook says this looks like it could be a robot\nYeah it is ... ... yeah if you ... they have like a robot it's understandable why company wouldn't want to throttle you in that particular case\nI mean it just does this just make the argument against Facebook in his shoe and against I mean why is it up to Facebook to decide what people can share and publish it it just or lost their platform they can decide when I I understand that it's a platform\nBut why you as a user would anybody want that\nWell so the users are just people who want to connect with people right that's why people gone on Facebook and the first place you oh I can connect with my grandma right on the Florida this sounds like we were like the evolution of how social media came about\nSo hey wouldn't hurt for people who are maybe go at one time\nOr do you remember geo cities or you're too young for that young for are you kidding me I was like the first users zero cities used to be a thing and then there were ... free way of life but he will let people here say ... but yeah OK\nWhat does that does not originally him there was SARS the original name I don't remember yeah anyway he was right and but no no not that I knew that there is some data that but you know like that's the earliest one that I could remember where people could\nMake up a page and post whatever they wanted and then they would join these things called Web rings yeah yeah where\nAre you know you put the script on your a page and then it helps people find things\nAnd then I remember ... I had one on one of my first website we all did I doubt yeah evolved into different things and then you know something happened something happened and here comes my space\nAnd then it just sort of like further centralize as the host staying and then people for some reason what from my space to Facebook and\nWell there's nothing wrong with the idea right like of er here here's a place where you can connect with a bunch of people that was the original idea behind Facebook which was originally it was a college platform remember it was right for college students to be able to kind of find one right buttering once it opened up to the general public\nIs what it seems as though the mass migration from my space to Facebook well I think it started targeting when they opened up there basically targeting high schoolers and all the college kids were on board with Facebook so already um these that had been restricted they've college kids and\nSo then they go high school kids on and then and now there's all left yeah but but prior to that then all the parents and grandparents got hobbies they wanted to see their kid right that read so we ended up with this month and you go and find all your body is like you know Twenty years later or whatever you could go on Facebook and look up your old high school where they see where they are now\nThere was another thing for that back in the day but flattering for either before you know classmates I think it was before a friend finder that's the one where you have sex with people there are no that's I don't [laughter]\nKnow oh by the way I pulled it up a so geo cities according to weaken the DEA was apparently originally called Beverley hills Internet\nFor a very short time yeah I don't remember I don't think I I don't think anybody in I think I Know like one of the only people in the world who knew that like I've never heard anybody else called UCs anything other than just that he's right so um and so so then what happened was once they created the platform where everyone could connect with every one or at least it felt like there were a lot of people on these platforms\nDidn't started to add more restrictions making it more difficult to actually reach the people with whom you want it to connect\nBy using things like normal post you could still send a message directly to somebody else a it still can do that fine but uh but you know the idea of a a page that has people liking it in following it will now you can't actually have your followers see your post unless you pay Facebook to reach them into others will come up here it's ... live\nFolks this is very important information what's to be said about CBD\nAre CBD is made from him\nAnd has point zero zero three T.
