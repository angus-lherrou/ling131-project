last time I ...\nWell I never thought that she got the blame that she should have gotten for that because it was so obvious you know why she got shot and you mentioned you were talking about this briefly the other day about Second Amendment remedies so that was Sharon angle that had brought it up\nRight she used that phrase the Sacramento yeah remedies specifically and and she was using a reference to Harry Reid wasn't she wasn't that when she was running against ...\n...\nActually I don't remember I'm you know I'm not an either or but but yeah we share an Alabama\nElection and you know there were so many bad things being thrown around and also one other thing Tom if I could very quickly it was could that could get phone spurs not corporal owns per\nYear right thank you for the reminder fancy though that yes ... bone spurs you're absolutely right Nancy thank you for the call to crazy here for a that's a good one Cheney and lithuanian Georgia eighty what's up [noise] you\nKnow him from um make three you're listening first call I thank my I was just a column about\nBill you know she she she she actually going on right now and that kind of wrote about just a few months ago life\nIs finally of course for the better half of the day after you get a match to write a pretty much you just gave the green light follow these fringe groups and\nYou know to use militia for white nationalist that we've you know sitting here waiting for that strike well whatever they have you know I'm trying to think if you look down on November was right around the corner right\nIs this the right for one of those constitution Pisces where you know you can always fall from election day the vote\nCould be very few things you can go both say somebody goes it shoots up\nRight or wrong rally from God Forbid me share some bomb goes off some of the way they can always say oh well you know it's not safe to polish the late for you know it's a fine you know transgressions\nWhile Trump already said that essentially in the choice that he sent a day before yesterday I mean this was naked voter suppression where he said we will our police agencies will be at the polls making sure I'm paraphrasing here making sure you know it's a felony to vote to illegally and we're going to ... you know\nAnd I mean there used to be those those on the twenty sixteen election or members of twenty twelve election um there were those giant billboards in black communities in Georgia and in in ... Wisconsin as I recall maybe Minnesota that said you know if the illegal voting as a felony five years in prison and all that kind of stuff\nSo yeah yeah I'm I'm with eighty\nYeah I'm just saying that everybody should get off the bat constitutional cars you ... you know they aren't making about ... you have a favorite way traffic\nRight I think you're right and and the and the and the important thing to note is that I mean ... when he started calling himself a fascist right away or there was\nA certain period of time with Adolf Hitler before he started calling himself a fascist I don't know how long that was a you know it's been three years since I read shares book\nAnd but you know Donald Trump has now embraced the white nationalist phrase the the the the we are a nation defined by our genetics and and uh that's a major turning point in my opinion\nAnd that what ... ... and the reason why that concerns me so much is that if\nThe Republicans hold the house of representatives in three hundred million dollars and the Koch brothers now going into these ads that we're seeing all over the country scaring the bejesus out of people about about Democrats\nAnd and then Republicans coming right out and why oh yeah I Love preexisting conditions I'm all in favor of blocking insurance companies are not paying them\nUm you know when they're in the middle of a lawsuit right now to take down the the blocking it to make it possible for health insurance companies to once again I refuse to pay for free as a existing conditions\nIn between the lives in the scares\nIf they hold the house and Trump continues with this nationalist rhetoric and you look at who he likes to hang out with he likes to hang out with the with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia I Am a bug you know a a an autocrat\nThe um the the these right wing governments all around the world their territory in the Philippines um Netanyahu in Israel uh yeah ... ... ...\nRussia um [noise]\nI I'm ... yeah he he was he met briefly with Victor or bond from Hungary at one of the G whatever it was meetings\nHe's he's not embracing\nSmall D democratic ... he's he's having open disagreements with Theresa May and ... and it could be just because they're women but you know he's also having open ... disagreements with Macron in France So it it's like he's not\nYou know ... ... Hitler in ... he got in tight really early and then they brought in Franco and then they brought in television show and pretty soon you had this axis in these hard right powers and it started to look to me like Trump is recreating that\nWith the United states get into bed with all these autocratic authoritarian regimes and rejecting the norms of democracy and step one is to prepare the people is to cause the people to think oh there's an external enemy out there they're coming to get us they're terrible oh jeez there among us we have to perjure ourselves of these people this is an old\nI don't know either a it's a pleasure to talk to you to him and the reason I uh I'm calling I wanted to follow up on that horrible and you showed by the Republicans okay ah one thing about Soros I don't even think he feels safe in Hungary any longer\nHow he can't draw to Hungary or bond would have him arrested with SARS is pressure was in that ad\nI I hear that yeah but I I suggest there might be a connection between or Bannon Sebastian Gorka Trump's Nazi\nYeah who's also Hungarian wouldn't surprise me in the latest\nOkay but the point I wanted to make through OK I paused and that you just played and to see who\nSponsors it and it's sponsored by a future America forty five I Believe okay there and I like to show who's responsible for this garbage and this is twenty sixteen data it's an open secret so I don't know how the go through and find a pull\nIt from the sea records and uh and and uh I arrest records\nThat are of okay okay so this is pretty reliable data open secrets access as it is okay\nAnd the reason I wanted to see who sponsors is twenty sixteen I imagine it's pretty much the same door neighbors who put in that horrible\n... ad well anyway it's um the dark money comes from the adult since the tune of like Fifteen million dollars [noise]\nUh let's see a cold is a big source of money I Am surprised to some of the Republicans I thought were less than horrible people the\nMic than manned family from Connecticut she ran for Senate didn't think she was quite easy\nIt is she now the secretary of something that's been tied wrestling folk she's in Trump's cabinet\nOh yeah oh I didn't realize it yeah I don't I don't think it was just ... but she's in Trump's cabinet\nPulsing of what my comment what about shaming these people my home state is Michigan and\nThis guy had been the chair of the Washington County Republican Party are supposedly not crazy but he uh he is a head of a real estate agent in Ann Arbor what about shaming these people I'm shocked and know that he's on a list of is\nA future forty five organization that funded that it\nYeah what do you think about going to the locally and shaming these people to know that\nThey I think you know in order to shame ... somebody Terry they have to be capable of feeling shame and I think a lot of these people aren't they are so these billionaires are so insulated\nThey live in such bottles there so surrounded by yes men and women are this is the story of Donald Trump as well they literally end up having no shame they think that they can run the red the rules by the way Louis just came and told me that it's been reported that Eric Holder also has received a bomb\nOr where something might be a bomb in the mail I mean this is this is apparently a big day for the for the killers on the right\nI got on the line but thank you for the call Dana and I point North Carolina ... what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi Tom I'm I just got to say that decades before ... attacked our election process we were influenced by a foreign power for Twenty years the Australian Rupert Murdoch\nHas been doing everything he can to be the the author or end a dedicated relentless driver of our descent into fascism I I mean ... they are the original fake news and always have been\nAnd this is Kevin rod and wrote this piece for the Sydney morning Harold or a few weeks ago called the cancer at the core of Australia and democracy Rupert Murdoch\nPerfect and governor on his foreign prime minister\nYou so he should know yeah yeah and it's still casting terrorism I mean they need their the author of that and the dry river there's all the examples you gave shown and they they literally trained Donald Trump for eight years during the Obama administration\nTo not believe his birth to to hate ... everything you do to the point that Trump is now reversing every thing that Obama did where did he learn that from Fox News Fox propaganda is what's running this country now Trump listens to you know Fox and friends he tweets out any lie\nThat Hannity promotes Hannity is as much running the country is Trump is\nAnd then and then Republicans run around and try to make the law is true you know as somebody on Fox's Jay there should be a ten percent tax cut from working people that would go over well Trump announces it at a at a at a rally in with a tweet\nAnd so then a Republican congressman says okay I got to write a resolution no resolution has no legal force whatsoever it's not a lot simply a statement I'm going to write a resolution saying that we want to have a ten percent tax cut for the average working person\nThe dust making Trump not a liar anymore I mean it's bizarre what's going on and you're right so much of this starts right there with Fox so called news\nYeah and Trump doesn't read anything or learn anything or even listen to the information from his intelligence he listens to Fox News he that that's that's his entire school from which he learns\nYeah and this is a damn scary thing they don't want to get one more call in here before the end of the hour or ... thank you for the call Anita in San Antonio and they do what's up\nHigh ... I think it's a problem when we demonize people\nI Want to turn them into some sort of evil character and I just I'm very concerned about why somebody would send a bomb to Debbie Wasserman Schultz are Andrew Cuomo because those people that are typical demonized on the right they don't even know who Debbie Wasserman Schultz is probably\nThe most of your bombers from Florida\nWell possibly been Debbie Washington shows I mean I just don't\nActually she was the head on the way I mean you know typically the people who hey Debbie Wasserman Schultz are the people who are part of the burning campaign that was your point Anita um but you know I I\nI don't think we should demonize turn them into evil ... if you don't agree with that that's one thing but she was trying to get some sort of talk of her she was telling your shirt and he was trying to destroy Bernie Sanders yeah I think we just I just want to keep that in mind because we need to be careful the phones\n... language that was used to describe Debbie Wasserman Schultz I heard language anything I once I did not and I hung up close yeah they're going to destroy your lives they're going to ... they're going to you know take over your ... no money that\nThey were ... some people were told that she was stealing the election from Bernie she was you know she'll have the evil\nIn some way she was but she was going to provoke a terrorist attack I mean that's political dirty tricks\nYeah okay we're not going to resolve this like I I keep saying I don't want a new element wars let's not try to re insight that kind of

great question I mean I think you know we're balancing the first Amendment rights are free speech which you know as a member of the ACLU I'm I strongly support and even when I don't like what someone has to say\nUh they often have a right to say it but there's also the balance of Donald Trump is the president of the United states he has a different role than when he was selling detergent er during his show Celebrity Apprentice and had to be sensationalistic for forty minutes an hour or so that people would buy more salads\nAnd he hasn't made the transition yet and uh he really seems to like that part of his base that lit really loves the red meat that's why he's doing all the rallies\nBut this isn't being present a United States um you know you have a different role when you're the president than when you are ah the main actor on Celebrity Apprentice and he is not made that transition so you know we really need him to step up a you know put the Twitter down\nA start you know we can disagree that will disagree with him strongly on many issues and you pointed out a number of them but\nIt doesn't have to happen in the tone and rhetoric that's happening now because this will incite people and eventually if it's not as this uh these cases today it's going to be something else down the road and uh we just need to do better as a country because people across the world look to us to be better\nJoe in Long Beach California Iran with congressman or can\nHey good afternoon I'm do you remember when President Obama was a running his campaign a week two thousand eight or two thousand twelve he went out with a national ad basically his closing argument to run for president I kind of believe that\nThe DNC needs to do the same thing\nWe need to appeal directly you know I'd I threw a camera to our constituents to millennials for seniors what do you think about that\nYeah do I think you make a really strong argument because you know that Donald Trump is doing it his closing argument is mobs caravans or you know immigration a lot of fear he's putting out there because fear is a great great motivator\nOf but we have issues that I think are more substantive issues that I can tell you people everywhere I travel and help candidates out come up to be number one and number two issues all the time health care people are deadly afraid\nThat they're going to lose access to health care because it's an absolute economic asserted too they have to have that or else they can't support their family or Social Security and Medicare um you know I just my my eighty nine year old mom ten days ago we moved into\nAssisted living and when you talk to her and other people who live in centers like that uh they're relying on this further their life and uh the fact that anyone would want to put that into Wall Street and let them you know roll the wheel and see if they can make money on it\nA scares people are quite a bit we should be talking about how we can make people rest assured that we'll protect those items will make sure that more people have access to healthcare and of course I Would love to see single payer Medicare for all but there's a lot of different ways we can do it\nBut we have to put those issues out there because people agree with us on the issues they may be scared by what Donald Trump is saying but then we can bring people back to really what is most personal to them it's not a caravan that's in the southern part of Mexico it's whether or not they have health insurance\nFor their family and I think you're right we need to make that case very directly and with our best spokesperson in right now I'd probably still is ...\nOmar and hurt in Virginia you're on the air as Carson poking\nYes Tom things so much to come up to ... to Mr Paul can I just have to question the first one you know\nImmigration is a very sensitive issue how do you recommend that Democrats walk around this caravan situation and the second question what is a fifty states strategy to win a house Senate and the twenty twenty twenty ... thank you\nYeah so I'm an immigration I mean what I've been saying anyways you know we had a bill that uh two sessions ago got about Seventy votes in the Senate and a bipartisan way wasn't perfect no but it was a comprehensive a bill to address immigration reform from some extra security at the border to a pathway for citizenship for aspiring Americans\nLet's start with that in the house didn't take it out the Republicans in the house at the time because the Tea Party couldn't get it on the floor\nOf this we are moving forward on this issue the answer is not a border um but we do have to address the Thirteen million people that are currently um and we have to address so when people do come to the border to make sure that we've got a the right ah protections in place so I I think you've got to go to something like that but then also share the very stories of why people come we're a nation of immigrants\nUh we have people right now coming with\nFair claims of asylum and they're not allowed the ... the the process\nThat's required by international law that were violating because of Donald Trump and his rhetoric around the wall so I just think we have to first of all de politicize the issue which is going to be difficult because the president only makes it a political issue and then ah you know appeal to a where we once were not that long ago a couple of sessions that go\nWith a comprehensive bill and then start clearly separating immigrants and refugees absolutely absolutely and

Monday's as mark Wednesday second hour edition congressman mark ... taking your calls for the hour oh Canada has that God has this website he's the co chair of the congressional progressive caucus represents the second district of Wisconsin and you can tweet us ... mark Pocan Stephen in Ferndale New York you are on the air with congressman Tokyo\nCongressmen poll can can you hear me yes I can Steven thank you I'm I'm I guess my question is a pretty short um are just ... what do you think that we can do and and what are your plans personally\nTo lower health care costs in the U.S [noise]\nUh Steven thanks for your question I so I you know I Am a\nStrong advocate of trying to get this country too I'm a single payer\nMedicare for all type system um you know I too many people in the district in my district in other districts that I visit a this is like the number one issue coming up I'm for their economic security if if they don't have health insurance or they don't feel like they're family secure as a family\nAnd ah you know not that long ago if you had a pre existing condition you couldn't get health insurance I called that profit insurance and uh we need to to get to that so along the way I'm going to do everything we can it probably first and foremost we have to shore up\nAll the damage it's happened by President Trump the Republicans to the Affordable CARE Act or but if you have a five thousand or deductible and you're making thirty five thousand dollars a year you\nAnd do that that's not affordable health insurance so we have to work on things like that we have to get this country to look a health wise more like Canada and most of a civilized Europe\nAnd I think that's my goal I think that's the single best way you do that you take away all the overhead you take away the paperwork costs you take away the advertising costs you take away the profit incentives are for insurance companies and you really will lower the cost of healthcare and make it more accessible and that's exactly where we need to move as a country\nAnd use the example thirty five thousand a year thirty three thousand a year is the median income in the United states have to help people make less than that so I mean that's not like we're not talking about small subset of the American populace here are incredible Danielle is sick or or New Mexico you're on the air with cars and poke yeah\nThank you my question is what is going to happen when these refugees hit that border I live here in the courtroom in New Mexico I was just in beer a cruise ship for a vacation and I saw\nLike a young fourteen year old men dressed enclosed like he was from what the Mona he was dead\nIn the side of the road\nAnd unlike the good Samaritan I didn't stop to give him water he was already did I could see\nBut I told the guards at the entrance of the part that I was hiking and so what happened in a better than Democrats planning to do when a when the uh the refugees at the border thank you\nYeah Hi Danielle thanks for the question and you know I understand too um at least from listening to the radio this morning I always ah when I'm driving and I listen to both Fox and MSNBC radio 'cause it's on a and just to see what they're talking about for the day and are you on Fox they're talking about a new caravan from El Salvador right they love the caravan conversation\nI'm for us I mean you know we have to do comprehensive immigration reform short of that we've got to address the issue is issues as they come up by the time that caravan hits that don't forget some people are going to stay in Mexico along the way and won't make it to the border for other reasons\nBut by the time it hits it can be about the time that we're doing a the funding or for the homeland security or and they will I think very likely especially if we take the majority try to use it to find funding for the wall\nSo we're gonna have to address that we're going to need people to be there to help us on the calls a when that time comes but I'm expecting a very robust lame duck periods is being one of the main issues in addition to the wall we've been able to hold back funding with Republicans held up to this point 'cause even most of them privately tell you they know it's ridiculous\nBut I'm a fearful that when this gets here there's going to be a real push so I think in the short term that that we've got to deal with the long term we absolutely have to get the comprehensive immigration reform that also provides for\nPathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans Thirteen million people here need us to address that in a comprehensive way\nHarold in Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress and folk and\nIs it I'm On the air you are Harold you're okay I just want to talk about the single payer or insurance\nI just got a month ago I got back from from a trip to Germany and unfortunately I forgot\nI ran out of a couple of medications\nAnd so it took one to a pharmacy in Germany and got got the medication and this one I got to take for for diabetes and one for the heart so I Do have some problems but anyway so I purchase those as soon

taking your calls and Laura and maple valley Washington You're on the earth congressman poke in\nTown and have that kind of thing so um I like to make a comparison between the time not that common sense ... that we need in America get an ethically and I'm kind of a background cats at a nation that we want to sell arms to\nAn extraordinary to I guess ... what can they can touch Congress\n... interesting point um you know and this is exactly what we're dealing with ah with Saudi Arabia right now right I'm not just the fact that uh they very likely from the very top for a complicit with\nOr not complicit with I ordered the killing of someone who's been a critic uh in the Turkish embassy but uh you know my concern and Ro Khanna and others\nAre concerns have been around the involvement in Yemen and you know every time we're more worried about the arms sales to a country like that I even know uh they're creating the second worst probably humanitarian crisis on the planet outside of Syria in Yemen and we've been involved in some of that so\nYou're right there should be standard so when you're selling weapons it's not just about the the profit or that you're trying to make for the defense contractors which Donald Trump seems to carry about ah this is really looking at who you're selling to and this is our leverage right now with Saudi Arabia my guess is Donald Trump won't use that leverage but hopefully we can find people in Congress in both parties\nTo have that conversation because I've seen more members of Congress vocal on this I have seen the president\nCalling from Newcastle, Wyoming Sunday you're on the air with Congress and poke him\nPerform with all the people being placed with a lot of disasters all the hurricanes if anything blowing bank to ensure that those people I'm not going to be purged technicality haven't developed a role or that they would get conditional ballots the down town or\nA you know a Sunday that's a great question I don't know the answer to that um you know right now especially in Florida where where we got a lot of people who were displaced I Hope that they're doing something to that front I have not seen much on that so I'm Sorry I Can't give you a good answer\nRob in Phoenix, Arizona here on their cars and poke him\nYes Congress ... hey I spoke to you last week or a prior about the Social Security income tax deduction in this point what I was trying to point out is is right now it's a [noise] excuse me a hundred and thirty two dollars\nI think it's like a hundred and Ninety eight I Believe yeah hunter was growing up the well I think one thirty two but regardless of like going up to three per se\nSix point three percent the auction at one thirty to my point was like if you double the cat you wouldn't have the tax we need to go from six point tree down to two or three something if you don't want to get it it would go down to one percent so basically what you could do if you push the limit or\nYou can lower the tax down to like one percent the government would still be making the same amount of money to fulfill via a Social Security requirements\nAnd that would immediately give everyone who makes a hundred and thirty two thousand or a tax break up or you know five percent right off the bat I'm it also since corporations are people you know we should check that tax on to their uh income taxes well ...\nYeah rap so that the differences were right now we have someone longevity problems with the Social Security because of the population so we're actually trying to bring in revenue to it so I think part of the conversation has been about lifting the cap\nAgain rightfully so it's a regressive tax when people who make I think this year one Twain was last year one train I Need this year might be one thirty two I don't pay another dime into the system\nBut we we if we lifted the kept completely you of over Seventy five years of future I into the Social Security fund that is probably the the most ... you know dressing\nA problem we have right now not so much that we're trying to lower that tax for people that you want to make sure the fund is available for people and a lot of us would like to talk about you know I'm expanding it and providing\nAn increase tied to the consumer price index e which addresses with seniors pay twenty five percent of their income on medications and healthcare a rather than the CPI which is you know often focused on things like gasoline and stuff that not all seniors are spending money on so um I don't know if we're looking\nSo much to try to cut the rate of the tax as much as ... program alive which is the most pressing concerns\nYeah congressman we have a minute and a half hour before the end of the hour I'm not quite enough to get another caller in here although there are people with questions about Social Security and healthcare\nI I I Know that you've touched on one of those topics but anyhow what it what do you think we should be looking at in this next week and how do you think that we should be best reacting to these are acts of terrorism that we're experiencing right now as a nation\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know we're left the two weeks from the election um it's going to get wild and wooly in the next two weeks be ready for it\nUh but the best way to deal with that while the willingness as to you know put some time in a supporting candidates of either party that you support a knock on doors make phone calls use your social media talk to your neighbors and friends because of the election is really gonna matter we saw what happened two years ago elections have consequences\nWe need people to be active and um you know we can do it in a respectful way we don't have to think a down to the level that they have to sync too we can be aggressive on the issues uh and still make our point and I think appeal to a broader a number of people that we need to for the election you know\nAnd and are pushing back on the lives out a way to push back on their absolutely\nWell you know the good news is the fact that right yeah we have those when the president says he's going to cut taxes or by ten percent between now and the election you just say to people Congress's even in session like there's not even not even possible like that is just an outright lie there is like zero percent truth that um\nI think those kinds of things are fair to point out factor of ... thanks so much for being with us again this week\nOf course they always great talking with you you can find his Web site at okay that house dot Gov

to the judge ruined but I remember the debate about it\nThat are in ... in California I guess is where it took place um that adultery is actually not against the law there anymore so therefore he could have an NBA with Stormy Daniels because there wasn't against the law couldn't be that the types of harassment\nOr that are being are on the verge of being exposed by the telegraph are are not
