proceed to reveal here's this here's the thing there's nothing in the constitution that prevents them from having a second vote if he were to fail on the first vote as one votes they could reschedule another vote I'm not aware of any Senate\nRule and they break that rule anyway the constitution says president nominates Senate gives advice and consent\nI mean if they got the votes for one of them is that what it was I mean they could just postponed the vote for a day or two or just have another vote I gotta tell you if in right Roy if Manchin said I'm going to vote no I changed my mind and Danes isn't there and it's one night when McConnell will just pull the votes reschedule it for Sunday or Monday\nRoy have a great weekend I posted on social media give them a look and let me know what you think we're justice is served\nImagine what it's like to be active your whole life\nAnd find out you're going blind that's what happened to me I have\nHe's related macular degeneration or AMD as a white mother and grandmother my sinus precious to me what a relief when I found out the treatments for some forms of AMD are available and the research is underway on additional prevention and treatment AMD is the leading cause of vision loss and people fifty five and over\nGenerally the bonuses would be like quarterly based on profit in a or at least the companies that I've worked for where they've given them kind of bone as that was quarterly\nBased on profit and then there's all kinds of calculations of if you are you not meaning you specifically but you being the employees met quotas and this that and here's\nThe calculated bonuses that it appeared from what I was reading that they were talking about the interpretation of it was that their bonuses like every two weeks like what like just like ... or early pay schedule yeah\nNo it's at the store is an employee that gets a bonus or is it only in one lump for the ones that are the my understanding is that we're talking about at least with within the air's says it was a four hour early employees\nYes so so it sounds to me like a warehouse workers there were basically they were referring to warehouse where it was might apply to other workers but most of the warehouse workers\nBut when I mean is do the bonuses apply\nAcross the board to all employees or is it only on the departments to get you know sit there and hold any is facing the bonuses out for hourly employees that's not that doesn't answer that question let me see if I can ask it in a different way what I'm asking is\nWhen they got the bonuses the hourly employees that got them were they given across the board meaning did everybody in a department get the bonus or was it only for the employees that actually did something out of the ordinary that that actually ... above a certain\nWay and the way and again I'm basing it only on the companies that I've worked for where they have given what are often referred to as quarterly bonuses yeah but sometimes was referred to as profit sharing but it wasn't based solely on profit it was based on a bunch of other calculations\nAnd the percentage of profit but it was to everybody it was every body okay and that was a percentage of what you had earned I see in the previous quarter based on this new calculations so the people that made more per hour so the supervisors\nWho were getting you know like one and a half two times what the lowest level people were getting I really they were getting like two and a half three times per cent as much and the ball as because it was based on weight earnings\nFor my my understanding of it was that there were it was basically how efficient you were that during that period of time so like if if you were you have to I mean there was minimum like there was a minimum thresholds but then there was the more efficient you were over that minimum threshold\nYou would get a bonus based on that so what you're saying you think that it was an individual incentive was individualized okay individual incentives sort of like a sales clerk a sales person might get\nA bonus for every is that is what you want to be\n... that they may as long as they're describing doesn't reward the individual right eroded reward everybody for sort of generic target whereas with the individual you're going to get better performance on an index which is better for the company and the performance is what they were after from uh from from what I was under my interpretation of what I was reading right\nBut how are you going to give a warehouse worker a cells bone it they're just putting things\nAnd it's ... it's an official on Fox is not sales bonus in efficiency by ... you get paid if you're the top movie or or whatever right so you're picking and pulling and drive and things around and if you can do it faster than the other ones you get the bonus that kind of thing so there are ... and I\nNever heard of that type of bonus ever go out and I've worked in a lot of their houses\nInto it's interesting um I actually it's kind of surprising that you haven't seen that kind of a bonus you worked\nIn a warehouse yeah they they pay hourly okay cause some\nPlaces will pay by the the pick too so you can like get paid based on your actual performance rather than just you know ... around for a half hour and then doing a little bit of work and getting the same amount of money so Amazon is known to do stuff differently though so it it doesn't really surprise me too much if they were to pay less or a ...\nOf course NATO or the news articles NATO in his article that mentioned that they're getting rid of the bonuses explain exactly you know held the bonuses were determined\nBut either way I details and even though the two types of bonuses you guys are talking about here are different they're both still better than no bonus because you're still incentivizing at some level of performance if the whole team doesn't make you know make the uh the performance school\nThen the whole team doesn't get paid versus the individual doesn't meet their performance will get paid either way if you cut both of those types of bonuses opposite me it was one or the other right you still are just now you're just down the hourly employees\nAnd they have no incentive to be more than an hourly employee which is why hourly employees are the worst way to go because you'll always see\nThe sort of this natural incentive for the employee to do as little as possible right within that hour in order to secure the job in order to secure continued pay ... never go to the amount of work I can do to not get fired yep that's basically that's basically what you're dealing with\nAnd then the only way you get anything better than that is if their employees who seem to value their role better than the other ones right and go above and beyond what the the sort of the bare minimum is\nSo is there more from the story as far as ah you know interesting detail about this what are some of the outrage statements if there are any I don't know if you happen to have is a detailed story with like you know some labor organizer complaining about this this is what I Would predict I actually got when\nI was reading comments and stuff on line now it seems like people were in supportive and saying something to the fact of well if they're still they're still better off without the bonuses\nI Wonder about that because if it holds Amazon or does it really all cost Amazon more would they make this change I doubt it yeah eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight

bureaucrats and the bankers and put it in the hands of the people go to our so again we were just scratching the surface and what it can do go to bitcoin dot com get started there and learn more about it\nNow as we continue here Daryl you had a part of the story about the ...\nWell he's upset because you you had asked the question of you know how are the employees responding and most of the articles don't really say anything about what the response is\nBut there is a very brief brief brief paragraph in a Bloomberg article that says that workers who are already making Fifteen dollars per hour or more\nWill get a one dollar per hour wage increase\nAccording to a couple of people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified\nA I guess for their own protection because they're not authorized to speak to the press on this and a lot of companies will have that ... you know put in some kind of agreement of you don't speak to the press on behalf of the company bought a da da da\nDa and says here that\nSome longtime workers\nHave expressed frustration that their wages\nAre only going to increase in a very small percentage compared to new workers ... or you know like brand new plus those that had been there a relatively short time who are saying hourly pay increases of forty percent right\nIf you are getting paid ten or eleven bucks an hour\nAnd then you go up to fifty or use me Fifteen dollars an hour yup that's where you're forty to fifty per cent pay increase is if you're getting Fifteen dollars an hour and you go up to sixteen 'cause they said it was the one dollar increase for anybody that already was making Fifteen now six point seven six point six percent let's\nThink of somebody that and I don't know what the current starting rate is at Amazon but let's say it very into it hanging on the area hold on but let's say that somebody that works at Amazon for say three or four year\nIs making fourteen dollars an hour right they're only going up to Fifteen dollars an hour correct and it's an insult somebody that got hires or gets hired tomorrow\nAlso make it exists in dollars an hour what the hell did I bust my ass here for the last\nFour years for what I'm getting treated the same way as the guy that walked in or yesterday yeah this is\nOne of the reasons why the minimum wage increase hurts a people and it is a insulting to the person who has ground there a way you know year after year after year climbing their way up through the pay scale in whatever ... a corporation they've got now all of a sudden\nEverything changes and then all the kids that came in you know within the last six months or making the same amount of that you\nMention it when you raise the prices of you know or raise the the wage you also all of the minimum wage also raises the cost of you know purchasing goods from you know everywhere so right so you end up actually not doing it and then the people above you know who are making more money they're going to demand the increase in the wage\nAnd at the end of the day he ended up basically everything just goes up I think you'll demand it but they're not probably going to get it I mean it might not have tossed him a dollar just could say they did something\nHere's the question so well a lot of those people a wind up leaving and frustration\nWithout it where they're going to guess what it was yeah I mean they're still most of them are going to want to leave the job if they like it I mean\nThis could be the straw that they raise the camel's back and then they go somewhere else it could be but again what does the Amazon care if their plan is to replace all these robots\nSell it winds up saving Amazon money\nBecause now we are not given this guy made twenty bucks an hour we're not giving him a bonus anymore or he's not getting stock options anymore right and he just walked out the door so now we're saving a bunch of money and we'll hire semi hiring subdued their Fifteen by you know it's it's actually interesting because it's a low skill\nJobs to begin with so they race that's actually probably in Amazon's advantage because if you're if you're getting your higher paid unskilled workers here I guess what you just get to hire new workers and pay them less that's correct they did that uh when I used to work at\nKmart back in the late Nineteen nineties they had all these older women ... now I Believe I sure am you know same a technique\nYeah there is a guy that we know that works at the Wal Mart hearing king where he said that some of the longtime workers are being offered ...\nCorrect that's exactly what Kmart did they came in with all these older women in their fifties and sixties that had been at Kmart for you know more than a decade or for a long time they were making decent money for a retail job because they were doing good work they worked there for a long time they knew what they were doing\nAnd they offer them a decent severance package to say say goodbye and a lot of them took it and then uh you know they hired some kids\nIt has been disproven but there is that clay so what this would do is for every dollar of welfare Mm let any Walmart employee receives Walmart corporate would be taxed\nTo wind up paying a tax equal to the amount of welfare that their employees were ... they just end up cutting cutting jobs\nPossibly will how would they also determine what\nThe amount of dollars the Wal Mart employees receive that seems like a difficult task\nWell I don't know maybe only employing teenagers\n[laughter] they're less likely to be on welfare they're healthy rising Bernie Sanders argued that employers payday quote living wage tax payers would save a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year on government assistance programs including food stamps Medicaid and public housing\nAfter Amazon you all government Bernie he's been hearing about this now after Amazon announced the\nPay hike Sanders praised the company and its founders tweeting thank you ... you know\nBe those three to death I don't know why they have this after saying Sanders praise the company ah but ... says thank you Senator Sanders we're excited about this and also hope you will enjoy it is bad and then Sanders said\nI Want to give credit where credit's due I Want to congratulate Mr B's those for doing exactly the right thing [laughter]\nI Wonder if he took that back after he found out that ah they cut the benefits and cut the bonuses or whatever [laughter]\nI don't know a Bernie Sanders cares about people's brought on by withdrawing he wants to hashtags fight for Fifteen\nBecause he needs another private jet or something well it's all political right so it's a political football the whole uh minimum wage thing is a a you know an issue for them to pass around and act like they're doing something for somebody when in point of fact\nThe minimum wage as you pointed out earlier it hurts the very people right and it was just like five or six years ago when people were saying\nGod ten dollars\nWasn't only five years ago they were saying that I feel I've been shot chanting for Fifteen Years\nNow I I remember there was the proposal back I think it was a twenty twelve there was the proposal for ten ten may let them away it's ten ten wow I don't\nFeel like or that I feel like Seattle uh put their minimum wage increase in back in like twenty Thirteen which would have been five years ago already and that's one of those things that's teared up so it doesn't go to Fifteen right away yeah yeah well Thirteen fourteen\nSo is a ... I mean these are animal and wages like ... seven twenty five something like that like that general yeah yeah some states have higher one so the\nEconomic policy Institute from twenty fourteen has an article six hundred economists I let her in support of ten ten minimum wage\nBut yeah just sort of seemed to have jumped from ten ten straight to Fifteen why not ... well let's go to a thousand a million dollars an hour and then you know that there's that bought four hour work week screw that nobody has to work more than what I worry year then we can have full employment because everybody will have a job\nAnd then everybody will be a millionaire\nMost everything gets outsourced well you know you mentioned the four hour work week but there\nIs an update on that company that did the test of the four day work week\nSaying probably about a bunch of companies that have done that I Know uh the airline that I worked for which was a subsidiary of delta they had\nSome of the chefs you work for

dressed wheels in the states involved almost two hundred and fifty employees across sixteen officers they worked for days equaling thirty two working hours instead of forty but they were still paid for five days so it's a little different than going ten ten hours or like you were talking about right well\nUh I remember reading about this and the way they're saying they were paid four or five days ... essentially they were a salaried employees I see that you still have X amount of work to do right\nYou have to figure out how to do it in four days four days instead of and you're still getting paid the same icy\nResearchers from Auckland University a technology studied the effects and found employees were turning up on time not leaving early attendance was better and staff took

could balance their work in a home\nCommitments and the founder of the company said he came up with the idea after reading reports that suggested people spent less than three hours of their workday

actually only get three hours worth of work done then hey San step up your game will give you an extra day you don't have to work here is to be working out\nYup he says he's considering making the

up since we mentioned Pittsburgh this one's been\nIn my show prep for a few weeks now it's like one of those stories not really a top of\nMind not really the most important but I was an interesting detail yeah Pittsburgh according to the hill dot com or and this was published the twenty seventh of August so it's about a month old a Pittsburgh will hold the distinction of being the largest city in the United states\nUh within I imagine it's top fifty I mean Pittsburgh's not as not a small rally top twenty maybe a without a daily print newspaper after the city's post because that informed readers it will cut its production schedule from seven days a week to five beginning this weekend\nThe post cars that which launched two hundred and thirty two years ago and is one of the oldest newspapers in the country had originally indicated in June to cut back\nWould eventually be happening while noting the digital edition of the paper will continue\nQuote it's the year two thousand

communications incorporated the company based in Ohio the owes the post ... set on June twenty seventh to trip alive dot com which is also pitched in Pittsburgh sounds like they're competitor\nQuote we'll be publishing a digital newspaper seven days a week and frankly we reach more people via online than through the print publication right and I love the\nPay yeah I remember when you told me that the ... that was stopping seven days right Pittsburgh was not going to have a daily I said\nWhat about this tribute and yourself apparently they've been all digital for several years yeah I and I actually found the rankings of cities based on twenty Seventeen population estimates okay\nAnd Pittsburgh is smaller than I thought a Pittsburgh proper has three hundred and two thousand people sixty fifth largest oh I'm not even top fifty right now they do have a very sizeable metro yeah but the city of Pittsburgh itself is very tidy\nIcy well it still may be you know the canary in the mind it may be a ... of of things to come for the larger markets which do still have daily papers because Pittsburgh isn't the first hour this paper in particular the top posts cars that\nIsn't the first paper to cut back their print schedule I mean obviously we've seen papers go completely digital but then I go to the ... rights but the midpoint is to go from we've seen some go from seven days to three\nRight so you know you get like\nTuesday Thursday and then a weekend edition or something like that\nYou know that way it's still I mean what's the difference if the news is out of date by two days or one day still still out of date you know yesterday's news today is the sort of the byline for for newspapers\nAnd uh the union that represents the hundred and fifty post cars that employees in the newsroom the guild of Pittsburgh quickly lashed out at the news in a tweet\nCalling to cut back quote an insane misguided plan and the beginning of the end well it's definitely the beginning of the yet but I don't know if it's insane or misguided yeah I mean this is a an old business that is trying to hundred and thirty two years old that's trying to stay relevant right and very knowledge ing hey\nWe don't reach as many people with this old pope print publication as we do with this website the website costs us weigh less yeah yep too you know updates uh you don't have the printing

I think yesterday\nThat the Boston Herald is now moving into smaller offices\nOr so a lot of these papers are downsizing they're cutting staff they're moving into a cheaper places I think this I think they're actually moving out of Boston in into a suburb where they can get cheaper rent that's not a bad idea smaller facility yeah I mean you got to do what you got to do but they're like these guys are waking up here are thinking they\nThe problem with being an old business are learning to compete as years do you get comfortable right if you didn't get these newspaper some of them have been around for hundreds of years\nThey are comfortable doing things the way they've always done them because of the way they've always done it as always worked and then all of a sudden the rules start to change and before you know you wake up you've got new competition nibbling at you from the Internet um now apparently New Orleans you got new competition coming into town or your product which I and he was one\nThing that's interesting I I also was reading up on that ah advocate based out of Baton Rouge apparently they're the largest paper in the entire state of Louisiana now that they have New Orleans servicing not only Baton Rouge and New Orleans but also Lafayette\nThe same company just purchased a ah this is new as of earlier this year in April\nA the company that owns the advocate purchased a local free weekly one of those alternative weekly right just snapped it up and the owner says the purchase is in line with his vision of preserving iconic Louisiana brands so they're they're doing it sounds like they're doing great if they got enough money to just go around and buy up\nAll these other operations and expand so that's why I'm more interested in like what did they do how did they change their business you know fundamentally to make it so they're expanding in a time when it seems like everything else is contracting right ... an old media ... voted and everything in a different\nThat's way 'cause that's what I Want to know they're doing something right is it I don't know what what is the thing that has different but it's doing something different yeah that sometimes that's what it is it's just do something with Vernon did say they don't have a pay wall right\nAnd I'm Wondering if that helping them because there are some people that are ... and you know whatever local newspaper\nThere's pay well well I can just pay a dollar a month and read everything on line or I can pay a dollar a week to get the Sunday delivered to my out why why should I pay more\nTo get some things that winds up creating trash right when I can just read it on line for cheaper but do you know anybody who actually buys an online newspaper subscription\nOr I Know a couple of people that are not surprise me if they had a news paper subscription on line for say like uh the New York times or the LA Times or one of the the big huge yard newspapers\nJust because there are certain content that will get published there that doesn't get published elsewhere\nDoes anybody out there are actually pay for these on line newspapers I mean there are people who are doing it the New York times him like a you know however many hundreds of night and I remember\nWe talked not too long ago about how much money they brought in from their online revenue\nYou know I have to wonder if they're not doing something like really obvious for example um there's a there's a huge percentage of the population apparently is using I'd lockers nowadays and I wonder if they are tweaking their ads\nTo get their average ad advertisements through the ad blockers so they have a greater percentage of advertising than anybody else yeah\nAnd there's I Wonder what percentage of them I was eating at ... ... ... it's it's it's something like I don't know something over so there is and I think ... the something insane yeah wow I and and you guys ... you can double check the ... that could be wrong but I Believe that's what it is it something like really really high now\nAnd it's interesting because most of these companies I've noticed or just putting up ... like they're trying to prevent you from ... in the face if you have an ad locker mhm I mean I just add locker but\nWhat's interesting is if your ads are not a noxious and abuses basically to the you were you don't have that problem\nAnd so I have to wonder if me either you simply a in creative getting creative and you know ... basically not being abusive to their you know\nCustomers or veal or maybe we ought to actually go to their website and see the thing to do it differently here\nUm in fact I can compare it so I just found the website for the parent company okay or the patio help any\nOf the advocate it's George's media group and when you click on our team is in the named George not Ga Ga Ga right or the so the word George with an ass out George's oh gosh yeah the\nApparently the order John Georgia's is listed first under our table so it sounds like it's just a small family company and they said is making it work more efficient\nI Love good because it is more efficient I Love a good success story in a down time like this uh it's really interesting where he also sponsor lemonade day Louisiana whereas a hearing keen this little town of twenty three thousand or city [laughter] uh twenty three thousand ends at your house [laughter]\nAnd uh they believe their city but uh this particular town I did an article in the city back in ah twenty Thirteen so now five years ago actually since this article came out\nA titled sentinel locks down Web content as circulation sharply declines according to cause newspapers\nIn order to sell their advertising has to be able to claim certain circulation right\nUh there's or the editor in chief assistant and six copy editors for people from the department are also being let go roughly one hundred workers will remain after the dust settles down from two hundred and forty\nTo one hundred\nHow much of the copy editing work heads to defend employees in Denver and ad sales increasingly it will be handled\nOut of Lowell, Massachusetts where they own the low sun meanwhile what's left of the tabloid team heads south from seaport to brain tree by year's end printing has long been outsourced first to the Boston Globe than to the Providence Journal\nThe company's top Boston area managers would probably say these cuts are about ensuring the Herald long term survival yet another painful downturn in print ad sales is sweeping across the industry and nearly everyone is scrambling to control costs including the globe print circulation is also dwindling as readership moves on line\nTo Harold for example cells only about forty thousand copies the date now and they don't give us a comparison of what they sold in the past but regardless uh yet another cost cutting measure\nAt yet another major newspaper that was in bankruptcy and got snatched up we're going to see this story over and over again\nIf you want to comment You're welcome to join us here in related news this is another one I'd had sitting in the inbox playboy\nStripping down as the New York in their headline down to four issues per year in\n... really Playboy's going to be a quarterly ...\nMaybe you didn't already know I didn't uh but apparently playboy is already at six issues per year so they've already done that either yeah they've already cut back by half\nI honestly couldn't tell you the last time I even looked at a playboy I Would have probably been like\nFive or six years old or something like that but I remember slide and walk around on the school bus we had a you know back when you go to school in school but he was you could slide things under the seats so some do brought a playboy in a and we're a sliding it back and forth on the on the bus and check it out\nI don't remember looking at ... I'm sure I've\nSeen one since then but that's the most memorable time a recording to the story here at the New York post they will become a quarterly magazine in twenty Nineteen\nAnd apparently they're planning to open a club in New York the re entry into the brick and mortar club business is the brainchild of chief executive Ben cone whos trying to re brand the empire founded by Hugh Hefner for the twenty first century and then they go on to brag about their new offices and all that apparently they brought back\nThe nudity I remember seeing if a few years ago the headline I think we talked about Iran freaked out why they got criticized for it and then they dropped it and it's like well wait a minute what are your customers want right now I'm pretty sure that was what they want it not at this article people aren't right into their customers are listening to like\nYou know some lactic wing activists and it's like they're not your customers why are you listening to them\nWell Cooper Hefner the son of the magazine founder announced the move to bring back nudity this is actually an old story from February of twenty Seventeen\nUh that's when they made this announcement they published he says quote I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated but removing it entirely was a mistake he said they published their first non nude issue in March twenty sixteen\nAnd then prior to that had lunch they safe for work playboy now app but as of march twenty Seventeen nudity\nIs back with playboy now apparently it wasn't enough to save them and keep them from going ... six this year right now one more I Wonder how that safer up actually like\nHas it succeed or has it felt like when I hear any more yeah I mean how many people actually the old joke about playboy right like who reads playboy apparently some people do\nBecause there are articles in playboy but I guess there are and they're actually not necessarily that bad um I have actually read the article used the gay land to like yeah I'm a law that says reading playboy I go I mean [laughter]\nNo but seriously they actually did have um like you know people really writing stories and stuff yeah for play by other sort of known for good journalism didn't want to her yeah yeah I'm the journalism wasn't bad it's just you know obviously that's not what attracted you know you're there their audience they build a man right right right\nSo so that those are some updates for you on the latest failures because the magazine industries had the same difficulties we haven't talked about it as much because you know for whatever reason they don't get Harold and when they fail is often but\nYou know the hidden time basically go all digital ... that was one of your little digital ... there was one of 'em one of them did I'm sure wasn't Newsweek it was probably ... you'll have to find out why is it up which what I was OK yeah there was a big there was a big ...\nOne of the big news the publications had had gone completely digital and that was a couple of years back\nUm and there was I remember a story about the printers of these magazines losing out big time and scaling back oh yeah and so like there are fewer and fewer actual printing a houses or manufacturing facilities to actually print these magazines that\nSo the whole industry as a whole is is contracting and if you're working in that industry\nMan it was luck Newsweek or you can twenty twelve stories from orders after seven eight nine years in ... get\nNewsweek goes digital only and they're still there I mean they haven't gone out of business and so I I've actually known that the printing industry um some of them have actually gone out of business and I'm Talking about the ... yeah yeah yeah um I don't have enough business coming yeah right right to sustain them so they're consolidating and\nSelling and yeah I um I Know a magazine twenty six hundred um the ... the reporter hacker quarterly and they had a problem where they were promising or you know what perjure and they took the money and like three ... and I guess the way it works is\nSomehow they get the money they get the money back\nOr something like I guess the the money comes in through the sue them like ... ... yeah\nAnyway so they they were like um three months behind and basically they the publisher took or the the printer I guess yeah took their money and so they didn't have money to actually operate wow to come out with the next issue and they had to find another printer and yeah\nUm I guess I guess the way it worked to something to the fact of um I guess the the printer like distributed distributed to the magazine and collected the money for an exam are really the money back [laughter]\nUm I go to the magazines and so they did is they basically so everybody has their way out printing yeah as they were going to a business they took all the money from all of their exit scale everybody who was yeah printing a with them so the big news\nFor time they're no longer part of Time Warner split them off I didn't even know what our media even though it was part of the winter\nTime was hitting in a

I don't believe that when I think yeah Robert ... and ... and they said you have to remove the side and she said I'm not going to remove decide\nOr else we're gonna XYZ and she's like oh just take it down or something yeah you're saying if you take it but I'm not taking it down [noise]\nOr if you want to remove you remove it the story is pretty fresh it was up day to just three hours to go on Star Telegram so I'm interested in hearing the the homeowners a you know the sign owners here is a Stanford what\nIs her explanation because all of this article here from Star Telegram says his sons say\nWell who the hell is that [laughter] who's saying she was told to remove the center of be confiscated city officials against St police said she asked them to take the sun either way the signs gone and Miller posted again on Facebook that he's happy with the result\nHe said quote the of offended bureaucrats I'm Glad that I called out this offensive campaign sign and employees that hundreds of others did so it was well it's vulgar and does it matter and just plain wrong doesn't matter and it had no place to someone's yard visible from the streets\nAre private property whatever size you want as long as it according to what the Texas code which I have pulled up\nThere's not more than thirty six feet of signs\nIn they are not that big it's not more well combined nasty she does have other side but still she don't have more than thirty six feet aside I see a dicey lottery sides are more than eight foot tall none of those signs are eliminated a lot of those have any moving element\nCorrect I see three signs here for science maybe of like the standard yard sign size right and then this larger signed with the uh the iconography with the elephant with the Trump going up a skirt maybe is about the size of three yard signs combine\nRight well in with I I thought about the same height I've found something from and I realized that this is outdated ah from two thousand eight\nFrom a group called the international municipal Lawyers Association that had a conference in Las Vegas Nevada in two thousand eight and at that time\nThey put out something called science wars the first amendment and political science and isn't the first time these sorts of things that I Know a on page nine\nThey talk about science on private property ... which is what this was on private property\nAnd again this is designed for municipal lawyers city counselors or bureaucrats that and I'm a hoop published this I'm Still in her national municipal Lawyers Association OK city attorneys yes yeah OK\nFor municipal attorney here's what you can and can't do about things on private property\nOn private property you cannot prohibit all temporary sides\nIn a content neutral matter\nKey words their content neutral\nYou can limit the size of yard signs both individually and by total square foot you can\nPlay is it reasonable restrictions on the shape heights spacing condition and composition of signs you can place a reasonable restrictions on the location of sides especially if it interferes with public safety\nYou may be able to place a reasonable restrictions on the looming nation of temporary science you might be able and again this is from two thousand eight and things have changed since then\nYou might be able to play some reasonable limitations on the duration of temporary sign post thing that is not tied to election dates and you might be able to limit the number of temporary size per lot to one per political candidate and issue on the ballot okay\nBut you said things have changed since two thousand eight wasn't there some Supreme Court decision there was that did basically throughout divine Gilbert\nIt didn't completely one of the dissenting judges that I forget who it was I'm thinking it was Sonia Sotomayor\nSaid that the a a logic you used to buy the majority could be years to invalidate every sign code in this country I'm interested in hearing a little more about that if you if you have a summary of what that the case was involving because you were told me that you believe that it could indeed do that\nIf somebody were to actually

doing a little digging already talked about sign ordinances a woman in Texas a little town in Texas called Hamilton in the middle of nowhere ... up by Waco\nShe got in some hot water with police where they confiscated her son cops are saying she told them to take the sign which seems highly unlikely given that she actually spent time creating it or hand\nWrite I I think most likely what happened is they said either you take it down or we take it and she says I'm not taking it down I guess that means you're taking it and they're like All right you said we're taking it yeah\nIs a clear violation intimidation of this person if that's how it went and we don't have the story from the the woman at this point did right but it's pretty much a breaking news story um but it was\nMe if there's something from the uh Texas in eight or Texas ACLU and the next couple of days I sure hope filing suit against the power of Hamilton\nFor violating basically every rice ... beach writes because political speech and this is the thing that changed with read the town of Gilbert, Arizona okay\nIs that the various types of sign ordinances were considered to be content restrictions\nAnd\nThe Supreme Court basically said you can't have a air ordinance based on restricting conduct\nWeight whether they were saying that signage size restrictions were also content restrictions 'cause there's plenty of size restrict them\nNot not the size ... the actual content of the side so in this particular case the town of Gilbert, Arizona placed restrictions more heavily on the duration of display of temporary signs\nFor events to where the town's said you can't put up a sign more than twelve hours before the event begins and they must be down at least two hours after the event in ... there was a church that did not have its own building\nAnd so they changed locations every week right so they would you know like ... between different places that they could rent for a Sunday and so every Saturday or friday I forget exactly when they were actually putting the signs up\nBut they were putting them up definitely more than twelve hours prior to the start of the church service and\nThe towns that you can't do that are or net says that it can't be up for more than twelve hours before your church service storage which basically says if you've got church that starts at ten o'clock on Sunday Morning you can't tell anybody via sign age\nPrior ten pm Saturday Night ... where the church is going to be so they went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court\nEssentially said that limiting me as a type of sign based solely on the information on the side is a contact the base restriction I see so what I mentioned about political signs\nIs still fairly accurate as far as uh besides restrictions are legit diverse corrections can be as long as they don't wind up saying\nNo more than this size for this type of side and this size for this other so as long as it's across the board all sides meet vis right then that the content neutral restriction but\nIf they say political science can be this size but other signs can be this size\nThat say content based restriction\nIn this case um she was in this case they're just saying somebody found this offensive right and he had to move it that is a content based restriction you can't do that well they did it\nWell yes you're legally government had like you are not allowed legally does things as they do whatever it is they want to do and then the only way that it\nStops temporarily is if like you said the ACLU or some attorneys willing to take this case take this all the way maybe to the Supreme Court in order to get the same damn results that had been because this isn't the first time some you know a trigger happy cop or whatever some ... ... jobs come along and stolen assigned from somebody acts\nIs also the state where the attorney general's ah Ken Paxton no relation to Roger ... who's been on this show several times a he is continuing the prosecution of a high school girls\nWho did not stand up during the ... of the recitation of slavery I mean the pledge of allegiance and\nThere's a state law Texas apparently that says that every one must stab to unless the parents say that uh it's okay for you to not stand or you've got some kind of injury or disease or illness that prevents you from standing\nWell this girl's parents never signed a statement saying she's not standing up she just didn't do it\nAnd she shouldn't have to shut and after not but the attorney general is continuing the prosecutor said even though there is a lot of federal court precedent including the Supreme Court right that you cannot force students to stand up and say the recitation of flavor it because", "year":
