talking about the DEA expanding their program it started in two thousand and eight they're going to be adding\nLicense plate reading devices to those you know those lines they've got on the side of the road those animated signs of flashing signs\nYou what your speed is is you're going by those signs it those may already have secret license plate readers in them\nAnd it would be very interesting because I Know I've seen one in uh where you live mark I've seen it in that town you know I won't say where but ah I've seen it it would be interesting to put in a freedom of Information Act if to to for anybody where you see one of these signs in use\nTo put it in a freedom of Information Act request where you live to the police department requesting weather up there partnered up with the DEA\nDid this sign come from the da ... been retrofitted by the da da da di da ... or any of the signs that you're utilizing Mr police department person or does this have a license plate scanner in it that would seem like a legitimate freedom of Information Act request\nAnd could go at least a little ways towards reassuring people or informing them but they are indeed being spied upon\nThe story here from cues the courts dot com reporting that some of these cameras\nCan capture what they call contextual photos which includes shots of the driver and passengers\nCompanies like Palin here technologies which was co founded by controversial venture capitalists Peter steel in two thousand three are incorporating facial recognition technology into license plate readers software officers can access vigilance intelligence led policing package on their mobile phones\nThat there's a mobile app to allow the police\nTo take a look at who's passing by their little signage device\nLaw professor Andrew Ferguson former public defender and author of twenty seven teams out like a book the rise of big data policing surveillance race in the future of law enforcement said the DEA quote finds itself at the intersection of new technologies scandals\nAh and because they maintain both domestic and international jurisdiction and dust can argue the need to use surveillance tools that would not be acceptable in a purely local law enforcement's\nUse it further for example most other domestic law enforcement agencies couldn't claim any right to no information from secret NSA wiretaps but because of the DEA can claim that they're tracking in for International Drug traffickers and does need to know information obtained outside the states they can use invasive techniques domestically\nIn addition to the da ... largely worked under the radar as our national approach to large scale drug prosecutions has not changed from administrative into administration the DEA has been funded and with federal funds comes playing around with new surveillance technologies\nJay Stanley senior analyst with the ACLU speech privacy and technology project so of course he thinks it's wrong for the government to arbitrarily collect such a broad swath of data in the first place holding onto it for future analysis only makes things worse he says\nOver law enforcement community at large argues that none of this data's being used to spy on everyday Americans\nWhat's the problem guys come on you trust us where officer friendly well then you learn in school\nSo are they like you know everyday American you drive past these points after that there are alleging they're wrong\nJoes yeah clone says well hold on I ... it's it's really important to point out that the national Security Agency when asked if they were spying on Americans multiple times during the Edward Snowden situation and several times before that several data lakes that before that was shown to be ... ...\nEvery set out to the way like you they would say something and then it would get shown as the law they say something more it'd be the law are saying the DEA would lie to people yes I'm I'm the needs to be really pointed out these people are like ...\nWhen they say that they're not taking this data and creating a giant database about Americans movements right\nIf anyone else would you do at that\nRight I mean it's their job is to investigate\nEverybody's committed a crime everybody listening to me right now is a felon whether they believe it or not they don't have to believe me they could just do be don't worry you talk to police enough you'll you'll find out that you committed a felony felony and then you'll be off to jail um so\nWhen you consider that everybody's a felon than police are investigating everybody they are legitimately so if they not only\nLegally yeah well I mean the legitimate as sort of a sudden a synonym for legal isn't it\nAbsolutely NATO okay okay well if you're you presume that any investing it most investigations are legitimate I get where you're coming from but really what they're hired to do is to investigate everybody because everybody has a felon\nSo yes they're lying or they're fools you pick\nThe former NYPD detective shows you a clinic commented saying we don't know when somebody's going to commit a crime we don't know when somebody's going to run over somebody and take off so that data should be there forever we never know\nLet me just going to eat it has and they were like you can't you're\nDefaulted on what I've never not paid this whole and they're like oh well you have this ticket from twenty Thirteen or whatever and I'm like so they never why don't they didn't even send it to you know because it wasn't me they just pulled somebody with the same name was like oh that must be\nThey eventually straightened it out but how they are not good at math\nSo a little bit more here from the story Cabrini Chang professor of law and ethics of Boston University's ... school of business told courts quote we as a society you have to think long and hard about the consequences\nI don't think anyone would begrudge law enforcement help and doing their jobs we all want them to do their jobs really really well she says but what are we willing to give up\nUnquote and you know if law enforcement were just enforcing violent crimes it would seem to be not as offensive\nBut we all know that government isn't like that government isn't this you know fantasy creature that only goes out there and does the right thing that only goes out there and targets the right person that even if they were enforcing just violent crimes there's been plenty of innocent people who've been targeted and locked up in that kind of enforcement as well so\nIt's hard to really give them a an inch but of course as we've seen they've taken a mild because people have given inches\nThey've accepted government tagging of their car\nThat was decades ago when that came out I don't know how when did tags first a first hit the streets it was it a hundred years ago uh you know it has to be close to that do they have tags when it was driven carriages I honestly I don't know um but if you want to come and You're welcome to join us let's go to the phones\nTo finally got bad slave on the line here he's calling from New Hampshire listening to L. R. and none of them go ...\nI had her a venue for the call I just want to say that the amount of government required to do what they're doing with regard just license plates but of course\nDoing it in any way more areas than license plate sure and about ... and of\nCourse that really requires not only a identifying\nOr the uh\nYou know the car and the ... and the play but it has to identify the person sitting in it and and and they're you know a ... there was never meant to be a a\nA you know a jurisdiction that that that reach out\nThrough technology to actually you know impugn people and sanctions that I'm for things that\nAre just kind of creative out of the you know the reality of the ... of of the ... do a police state that we love them\nI just if it's freaking me out that people are sitting here looking at this stuff I mean I've been watching this grow on you know\nOr you know\nFive decades and decades\nAnd and I you know and and the slow I mean the the amount of people involved in and in\nKeeping track of of other people just just bizarre and em\nAli raises your worst increase in the right it's the worst thing that that people could could ever put up with and yet people think it's all well I mean I guess\nIf I'm Wondering what other people think about all this I mean it would be interesting to get a public opinion poll and see you know yeah tracked me everywhere\nI had a conversation is a bad guy had a conversation with somebody today really where um my wife happened to be around and they were just told us talking about paranoia this person works today I'm I'm In a mental health facility and uh you know basically\nI said something the effect of but the NFC is watching you it's not paranoia if it's true\nI mean if they had to it it's more of a conspiracy theory to think that they're lying\nShe and my wife had a good chuckle about how crazy I Would never walk just ... well I mean they don't really understand people they just laugh\nIs was it like an uncomfortable laughter no no link you crazy ... well I mean it's it's funny because her husband is a crazy sounding like a crazy guy because look the government is watching you well they are watching you and crazy people say the government is watching them\nLike there's there's two things are true crazy people believe that the government is watching them\nMore large corporations or whomever some nefarious large organization is watching them and some nefarious large organization as watching you\nSo both of these statements are true one is a psychotic\nAnd ... and that you may think that they've got these ah\nAh you know black SUVs following you around or black helicopters flying after you or whatever the helicopters are usually pretty easy to detect but they're not flying helicopters after you you are not worth it right however they are grabbing your medical data and if you don't get a great chance they can get right they had they they've we know they're grabbing your better data\nAnd if you presume they're not grabbing your actual data\nThat I mean we we I think they they why would they not do that oh they have laws they don't care about their laws they showed it over and over again they believe that they're above their own laws that slave other comments go ahead\nYeah I you know like\nI just watched the video that was married to buy a\nLark and rose rarely am I'm ... and it was a video of a A N over driver you know recording\nYou know 'cause he's got the dash cam everything recording a a stop\nAnd and the the cop is made of there was no reason for this by

done a study that they want to just go on my toe is a little over a driver customers are picking them up\nAnd and you know that this cop pulled him over\nAnd then you know he was just saying that

Ian here Melanie and mark speaking of crypto currency is we're talking about that with a banker right now we can continue to discuss\nA pledge of allegiance or didn't into the Amazon topic or whatever you want to talk of your butt bitcoin dot coms great place to go to learn the basics if you are hearing us discuss ripple you know what the heck\nIs that uh well it all kind of started from bitcoin way back in two thousand nine in fact we're coming up\nOn a list is isn't it like ten years this month or somewhere around now that ... she released the white paper or something there was some other thing that happened before\nOr the actual release of bitcoin and two thousand nine and that's coming up around now it's not I don't know if not we've already passed it um but it's been about ten years now since bitcoin was released and it is changing ... before\nBitcoin I Believe there was some kind of a you know idea of transferring value and things like that bitcoin really kicked ripple off\nA bitcoin dot com is where you can go to learn more about the one that started it all I don't know if I've heard the company ripple existed I didn't know that they actually had a like a working crypto currency product a I don't I don't know that\nThey had the coin necessarily but the coin would have been something I'm inside their system anyway save it\nOr say that first dot com is a site that bitcoin dot com want you to know about is a place you can go to save big time on your purchases and Amazon ah I Do it all the time whenever I Need to buy something through Amazon I go to save it per se dot com\nAnd I usually say at least twenty percent on the thing that I'm looking to buy in fact we just open up the quaint embassy here in Keene New Hampshire and it's the the first one in North the north eastern United States or the second one in\nUnited States and basically every single thing that's in that bitcoin embassy as far as like the tables chairs the you know the screen that gets put that all came from say the ... we say twenty nine percent on most of those items there was one thing I needed fast and I only put that for twenty percent but\nMan you can name your price discount overt save it first dot com and now the dotcom want you to know that\nYou can deposit bitcoin cash into your account at say the purse Sudanese either bitcoin BTC or bitcoin cash PCH through save a ... big time on your Amazon purchases save eighty per se dot com if you don't have the cash or the other big point that you can't say a big time\nYou know you'd have to pay full full Amazon prices do you really want to do that\nIt's not going to say the first dot com today\nAs we continue with your calls aunt us a libertarian banker is still with us here on the discord on her call in line rooms you were telling us that are the ripple people have come out with some sort of\nProduct some kind of solution or for banks this has been something they'd been touting ah for a long time as their goal and you're saying it's actually available or it's going to soon be available what's the status on this\nSo it's it's called ... and it's available today um but real quick a river was founded in twenty twelve and then twenty third actually changed their name to ...\nI was twenty two actually called I think open calling okay with that and showing twice while when they can anyway [noise] um\nSo so the point I wanted to make all the stars of but yet it's called a ... it's a it's a interbank a current as a country that allows banks to transfer currency internationally\nOr to make transfers internationally as very little cost so I when I was on a on a bike or actually looked up the average price of an international outcry wire try so this is just send an international wanna say sixty bucks\nWell okay I suffered a nine dollar okay it's a it's a fifty bucks to send in international why not now that does not include the incoming\nFees as well as the on the other end add a lot of people don't know that there especially with your bank with a smaller bank um they actually used several intermediary banks and that wire right right so a small bank may send it to a bank in New York that then transfer to a bank in\nA in ... red within transfers it to a small town and in Spain this\nCuts out at all that middleman ... basically you're just going from one bank to the ripple ex rapid thing to another bank\nExactly and so they're just facility and that transfer and like I said there's gotta be some kind of a state exchange rate guaranteed that I'm sure happens know that you know that that would be very important to banks I Would I Would assume so there's not a change from when it leaves the U.S too when it arrives\nAt work in a bank and we don't need to say which one but ah I don't think it's a mega corporate bank if I recall correctly cause you visited here and you know we've talked about that but\nUm is there any kind of action as far as ripples coming to put a pitch you guys are or they focusing on chase or they focusing on bank of America or are they focusing on the big banks\nWell according to the article here I I mean there's been no talk of that any company I was I've worked with but according to the article here and there um [noise]\nI was just down here I think there were about um I mean there were dozens of banks according to this article that had already signed on now a lot of them and it had already said that they were not going to be big banks that signed on a quarter of this article\nUh so it's it's gonna be a lot of the smaller banks more nice sort of banks the bank than tend there there you go a Spanish and that's a big bang yes I spent absolutely big in the U.S\nI think they've got every ... I'm Sorry my policy they have not signed on but they have their own ... block change based products that uh\nNow he's going to be a possible competitor to rebel because I mean obviously ripple is focusing on banks but what if banks just come up with their own thing and they're like well we had to\nGo one pay FX as a proud of the name here and I'll I'll do research on that may be caught in the\nInterest in what about a stellar lumens which is another top ten crypto currency right now that from what I remember hearing was\nFounded by one of the founders of of ripple or more than\nWhat it basically do the same thing that they already do the ripple was doing\nSo I mean obviously this is a competitive market and that's what we want and and money which has never been there we've never had competition yeah international my transfer I mean yeah each bank charges a wire and you put it all runs through the same government system that that transparent transfer the money for\nThey don't change their their way of doing business very often 'cause well their federally regulated and there's a lot of controls on what they can and can't do and\nThey're sitting pretty basically as far as they don't have a whole lot of competition\nCrypto currency brings competition to the world banking and that's why a lot of the banks are upset about it like Che Spanx Jamie diamond Jews the c._e._o. over there has been on the attack\nAgainst crypto currency over the last few years other old old school banker types have been very hostile towards crypto currency is\nI mean what is your speculation here I mean you know what it's like being in these border board meetings and banks are you really think that this is something a libertarian banker that banks are actually going to get excited about\n[noise] honestly I think I think tank banks don't even think about it right now to be honest with you I think this is the cutting edge it so I'm off the radar of so many banks that it's not even really talked about ... except in the more progressive for thanking sort of\nA little how they're going to be that ripple can come into a board room and say hey we've got this new X. rapid product\nAnd of course the first questions going to be great where can I send this a ripple to work and I use this X. rapid oh All right now is that one bank in Hong Kong there's one bank in South Africa ah we've got five more banks say they're going to come on board I mean that's not really valuable\nWell obviously it needs to build from from scratch I mean you took free talk live from one station up to what a hundred and almost two hundred that you've got sure but\nThat's a one way every system yeah I was with free time live we're just trying to sell you know putting pitch radio stations aren't taking the show we don't have to have another station on the other end that they have to agree with something to like with banks they there's going to be a destination right so these banks want to send money internationally\nBut if they don't want to send money to the one bank in Hong Kong that might be picking this up I mean I'm just speculating I don't know how many banks are going to have it launched maybe they'll have hundreds of them but it's got to be a tough pitch right to work\nIn Europe I guess my point was was that it doesn't it's not an overnight success it's always something that takes time and as you build and and get more countries in central bank on board with this transaction system then more and more you know more demand happens is that it\nIs it a central bank that they have to get on board\nOr are we as a member of banks that and member banks but obviously central banks have to be on board to prove it from a regular\nOr personal active on ... let me as an artist and allowed\nThere's certainly an amount of ah crypto currency transactions that are going on and what they call the ribbons marketplace\nOr people remittances women's rights of people in one country are saying I Want to help mom and dad back home and the money's going all the time from rich countries the poor countries\nBecause somebody managed to get in and is working hard and trying to sports but in those cases using Western Union using money Graham so there's there's there's the main Britain's marketplace but now crypto are creeping into the ribbons market people find out little by little word of mouth gets around here a man you can send money back to the people at home and\nIt does or does if there's a way to get out that's the trick though because if you can send it to somebody in another country but they can't do anything with it then it's worth\nIf I could jacket report has already been I'm competing with watch and union money Graham with a couple of products that call according to this article here really is mercury FX and actually I don't know how to say that one but ah there's a couple of other pain that companies that they've helped develop\nCrypto products or um that compete with Russian you money grab so they've already I think I think pretty much conquered that market and our on to bigger things with this with this X. rapid product and so this is not for small transactions with\nYou know or you know Jose is sending money to his family and Guatemala it's it's this is for big transactions between banks settlement with purchase of you know a bonds and security is another you know trade of all sort of debt assets you know that's what they're buying what the script it's\nIt's banking it's huge banking transactions there's a lot smaller transactions so you know I think they've already pretty much I feel like you know put the um needles into that market enough no answer that smaller market is what I'm\nSaying yeah I mean I I Wish them the best I don't I'm not interested in buying ripple personally but I Do hope they have success because I Would love to see\nBanks become faster and banks become more competitive and and have prices drop and you know give me the opportunity to buy something that's not a wire transfer or some ... to move money\nSo I Know I've talked about all the positives of it here is the one thing I wanted to point out that I think is probably a negative part of how ripple works is there are currently a hundred hundred billion tokens ... out there of April and what was the company actually owned sixty percent of those tokens\nBut a fifty five billion according to what I've read online\nAre actually in this article fifty five billion of them are still in escrow and can be released a overtime or end of the marketplace to you know\nI ... and ... when they play the ... so you work with only gets worse Thirteen percent right now but imagine what as a company controlling sixty percent of a currency can do so I think that's a human is certainly a cigarette out\nI Wonder if uh their competitors are doing something similar is still or lumens working that way or are they are they all ... in the marketplace uh I don't know it's interesting and right now according to clean market cap the ripple is actually nipping at the toes of the number two crypt which is a theory I'm\nA Syrian within twenty three billion dollar market cap twenty three point five billion\nAnd ex are the ripple where they twenty two point seven billion so they are within a billion dollars of one another very very close of course neither of them are anywhere near the market cap of bitcoin which currently has a hundred and Thirteen point nine so bitcoin BTC will almost a hundred and fourteen billion\nAnd rebel has tremendous moves in the last two weeks I'm you know they've been they've been shot up more than Seventy percent of the day because\nOf the speculation of this product right here right now I see yeah absolutely that's what this article or talking\nAbout it in so banker you'll have to let us know when they come knocking on the door there at your local a bank where you are an employee and see if uh you know see what their pitches like it'd be interesting to hear you know what they're doing thank you for the call tonight appreciate hearing from it because if they could you know if if if ripple could make it so\nSomebody who joined this ripple system doesn't have to worry about who the other partners are if they can somehow make it so well if you join our system\nThen even if a bank isn't a ripple partner right if they haven't joined the program yet right on the other end will we have somebody in that country who will send a domestic wire transfer to the bank\nSo 'cause right now the idea is that this ripple thing is going to help banks internationally send money to one another but if you know on the other end if some bank in Hong\nKong that you want to send to hasn't signed on with ripple if people can make it so people can make it so they can still end up transmitting money to that bank on the other end that would be a big deal to cut out the international wire transfer aspect and then just simply domestic one on the other end you could still at the very least lower costs I don't know if that's what they're doing but\nI Would certainly be

she'd get up a a a one and a half and have a seizure gee we're all down and a half percent right yet who not want to have a seizure of the stairs [laughter] right well so we um\nWe ... we um got her out of school\nAnd this I don't even think it was a month and a half and the school said no you can't teach her send her back to school\nAnd I'm like this is my greatest earlier in the sense\nThat as a home school parent this is my greatest fear is that somehow the the government schools once they get there once they get there the tentacles into you that they latch on they don't want to let go now my son's never been in the government school that makes it easier 'cause then they don't necessarily know exists right so if you know if\nIf you go and you take a dollar from somebody they want that dollar back\nWhether they got it legitimately or not they want that dollar however each people means greater funding for those governments great if you get a dollar that your own and they've never had the national that dollar then well you know this is a whole different story and they've never had my son so they don't see dollar signs around him quite as much\nBut that doesn't help our call oh it certainly doesn't just ready to swim\nAnd I grew up I um I went to a school and have we'll call them ...

I said this is stupid this is ridiculous why should I be sitting here so they're forcing their daughter reached my kid just as good as you yeah\nSo there for saying your daughter to go to their school and at the same time telling you you can't come talk to them\nKnow all that was a different school\nOkay moved since that okay\nI thought that they thought you said this is ... you\nKnow not the state not the state the school system ... kicked you out when we moved to the other one is the same it's the same geographical county ... but that that particular place that we were living doesn't is almost like a private school they don't\nThey don't play well with others so to say now I Know why because they do they don't play well with others\nSometimes you don't want anyone to one spot in Mississippi to a different spot in Mississippi to try to change schools\nWell no we lived in a place in one town we moved from that town\nOn to another one because we actually physically moved in with um the other with the family that I saw\nSo it was still coincidence you didn't move from one point to another to try to avoid the school system in one place versus the other you just happened to most people\nDon't you just went luckily he didn't have that problem\nBut you are going to school groups or other people in the areas at home schooled to see what they how they dealt with\nIn a no I didn't because I didn't\nHave enough time I didn't um I\nI what's your status today as long as your daughter at this government school what what are you what do you what's going on right on how\nWell she is at a school she is at school but we she has an elevator passes she can take the elevator she doesn't have to walk up the stairs and she has a few other concessions that they made\nYou know the typical um stuff they do for handicapped people and um and that's about all they did they didn't ... I mean when it comes to things and I say to you know\nLike we were talking one day about math class and I was saying how how did how how is that possible I said that wasn't the way it was when I was in school right said well that's how they do the math and I said now doesn't change now Zach said today as it was twenty you\nRight right it's a ... that it of itself is crazy I may have amassed I may have an ... an idea on how to ...\n... yeah I I have a feeling that's the only thing that can be used the it's the new map\nGo ahead ... yeah I may have an idea on how to handle this so there's the best I can tell no I'm real law that parents can't live in one state and the child couldn't be a resident of another\nAnd if you could figure out some way shape or form that your children are residents of some place that has a great deal of home school freedom let's say Connecticut\nUm and then they are just simply traveling with you while you live in um they're visiting or whatever you know these are all just in terms of rights and at that point then Mississippi doesn't have any rights to your girls um and you know they're just Connecticut home school kids\nYeah you still got to figure out a way to get him out of the system but it's like getting somebody out of a prison he thinks a Olympus for your call tonight I appreciate hearing from you I Do like Melanie suggestion of getting in touch with local home school groups there in Mississippi and see\nWhat other parents have done in these circumstances 'cause it's likely you're not the first person who's been threatened by these government grants more coming up production\nHappier prefer much shiny or don't care foster has really know what it was a lot\nShe is a hundred and five pounds of shiny moved happy dog for life the shedding staff itching and stopped\nSince two thousand and one we've helped more than a quarter million dogs get over the nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers Brazilians and that the health\nEverything we tried sail except that died of come to dynamite proud and now it's like a duck and how can you gotta pay the how can how can I make a three fatty acids slack scene think failed to digest that vital that are cooked out of regular dog kind of fight is Tricia dying to fight for life\nI don't know about your dog it's scratch bank or something like crazy come to ... for help\nEight five nine four to eight thousand eight five nine four to eight one thousand and I'll take\nYour property in your family are precious protect them with blank motion activated H.

is considering a plan to open as many as three thousand new Amazon Go cashier lists stores in the next few years according to people familiar with the matter\nAnd aggressive and costly expansion that we're threatened convenience chains like seven eleven\nQuick service sandwich shops like subway up an Arab read as well as mom and pop pizzerias and taco trucks wait a second\nCashier lists correct sandwich shop\nCashier list stores that sell a variety of food items I have not seen a cashier lists sandwich shop before in one hand I think of the new idea the coin that's\nWhat is that by a laundromat\nNo acquainted I Believe that the terminology this is where you would go in these they'd have tables and chairs and somebody would maybe go around the white the tables but they would sell you your food I'm Out of pay machine non yeah\nAnd you know as you ate at ate the food whatever it might be even they restock that stuff it's like an automatic or something like that you oughta maybe that's a term that I'm thinking of I'm I'm not exactly sure what I've heard different terms but um have you been to one of those places no no I mean these things are from like liver and ensure their old yeah [laughter]\nUm I Can't imagine this working\nWell you may recall marketing if you're on the show and we talked about it or twenty sixteen and they're going to get into it here in a moment but they have they've already tested this okay good so it already works and the question is can they roll it out nationwide a chief executive\nOfficer as I get the choice to choose between a a I'm going to a subway and watching somebody make my sandwich versus just going getting something out of a you know some little refrigerator someplace I can tell you I already have that option I can go to seven eleven and get a slightly cheaper sandwich and I do not do it\nYou may not but somebody out there is probably very much interested in just grabbing and going\nYou know you don't you don't want to stand there for ten minutes you don't wait in line sometimes some some ways not slow about making a sandwich when he started but if you're waiting in line behind five people and it's it's a it's not not pleasant ah that's why I actually used with with subway and they're not an advertiser or anything like that but they've got the Internet or\nAnd I'll order on the Internet and then it usually speeds things up for me because then I can just walk and be like you are to pay for that that is mine and they hand it to me I'll be ... and then I'll eat yeah um so it's a lot faster that way but if you're behind five people and you gotta wait\nThat's what twenty ... twenty minutes maybe depending on you know Fifteen minutes depending how fast they're ... sees eliminating mealtime lug gems in busy city says the best way for Amazon to reinvent the brick and mortar shopping experience where most spending still occurs but he's still experimenting with the best format\nThe convenience store that sells sells fresh prepared foods as well as a limited grocery selection similar to seven eleven franchise or a place to simply pick up a quick bite to eat for people in a rush similar to UK based chain threats or excuse me credit Bangor one of the people said\nMan gr a a Amazon spokesperson declined to comment the company unveiled its first cashier lists store near its headquarters in Seattle in twenty sixteen and has since announced to additional sites in Seattle and one in Chicago\nToo of the new stores offer only a limited selection of salads sandwiches and snacks showing that Amazon is experimenting with a concept simply as Neal on the run option\nTo other stores including the original Amazon Go is what they're calling it also have a small selection of groceries making it more akin to a convenience store\nSo if you've heard of this concept of the long tale how is it I've heard of it but at least elsewhere yeah so when you think about um certain industries retail that kind of thing ... there's one retailer to retailers are small segment of retailers that makes most of the money and as you get a Wal Mart Walmart\nAmazon now when you look at Walmart an Amazon you look at a doodle you look at Facebook\nIt's not that they're a profitable company with profitable segments it's that they're a profitable company that really has one or two or three or four or five really profitable products\nAnd I think that uh Amazon's making a mistake here I think that they're going to find that they you know maybe they can afford the mistake but I think that you know just because it's Amazon doesn't mean it's going to be successful no doubt on fails all the time of course\nIn the street with apple right like Apple's had some spectacular failures over the years but they've got some real successes as well so what makes you think this isn't gonna work\nIt just doesn't seem like it makes any sense to me on the idea of going into you know the cashier with stuff and yeah I just don't think it's gonna fly\nOkay well the way it works and and we when we first talked about this a couple of years ago we explained it at that time but um this is how it works shoppers use a smartphone app so they're Amazon apt to enter the store one now I gotta get 'em up my phone to walk in the store that's great\nYes that's right or to do that\nNo I I get this isn't for everybody mark but then again you're not exactly a millennial working in a big city are you know\nLook you can if it's convenient you guys have their phone and their hands all the time they're on their way to work there on their break or whatever they're on their phone so for them pulling up an app as they walk into a store ain't nothing no big deal they walk into the store they scanned their phones at a

only make the United states rich in security on peer but also enable the U.S navy to be so powerful that America dominates the globe\nSo it I I never really realized that it it's you know it's it's a kind of a country\n... Ito variation on DNA is destiny is you know that that ah you know if you're born comp attendant for particular areas if you're born very very athletic you have an edge an athlete in athletics if you're born very very smart you have an edge in academics if you're born\nYou know it temper mentally or whatever it may be I mean there's all these other things as well that we've talked about in many times but\nGeography is destiny and it's kind of the same thing you know it's it's it's the the the the the ... the tools the the the gifts or whatever their country is born with but it ultimately when you get right down to it ... what we're talking about here's infrastructure\nAnd it seems to me that the Internet is the most important new infrastructure it's the new river\nRight it's a new way to transport things to order things on line and they show up at your house\nIt's the it's the new feels\nRight you know and in countries that have large areas of of a formidable arable land or you can go out and buy food from your neighbors you can grow food well here you can order food right so widely available\nI don't think I'm straining this metaphor too much but you know if you think so let me know give me give me a call on this um\nI think this is just a fascinating concept and we're now ties back into Trump and and the Republicans in the Democrats is that\nIf the Internet is the new infrastructure that is going to rival mountains and rivers and and large tracts of ah you know a rich farmland if the Internet is that new kind of fourth or fifth characteristic of a country\nThat allows them to prosper\nWhy then are we turning\nOur Internet here in the United states over to about five giant transactional corporations you know Comcast eighty ... and whatnot uh why are we why are we protecting these ... these companies\nWith laws\nThat forbidden ...\nWell I actually don't forbid them from doing this that allows them to prevent other Internet service providers from offering Internet over their copper\nThey own the copper infrastructure but they don't\nBut they you know if they have asserted that they own the data going through it\nNow in France and South Korea and Japan in the way most European countries\nIf say for example Comcast to use the example I mean you know I don't know that they're operating in those countries but if they were operating in France\nAnd and you got your Internet firm Comcast\nYou could say well you know I really don't like Comcast Internet\nService at a particular I don't like the fact that they're reading my emails and tracking everything I Do so I'm going to go with the acme secure Internet service I'm going to have them as my Internet service or his broader because they don't track me and they provide better security\nWhere they're faster or they're cheaper I mean there's all kinds of different ways it in a service providers can compete\nAnd do compete which is why typically you know high speed Internet and I'm Talking high high speed a hundred mess up and down high speed Internet in Europe as you know twenty to fifty bucks a month depending on where you live here in the United states is fifty to a hundred dollars on\nThese companies are getting mind boggling Lee Rich I mean Comcast made so much money in this business that they were able to buy NBC\nI mean just breathtakingly rich\nAT and T. by and CNN I mean it's just it's\nWow how'd you get all that money oh because we're essentially allowing these monopolies\nAnd if this is our new infrastructure if these are our our rivers and fields and then and planes and if that's what this is\nWe are shooting ourselves in the foot hugely number one by killing a net neutrality so that these companies not only can lock down you know can lock us into this to their Internet services which they can do before you know before the\nDeath of ...\nBut also by allowing them to extract from us all this information without our um you know those he asked a consent anyway\nAnd then sell that information or market that information or use that information to market things to us\nYou know everybody understands that Facebook is Mark Zuckerberg he became a a hyper billionaire\nBased on his ability to know everything about everybody so that advertisers could say you know I only want women between the ages of twenty five and thirty five who live in a in a house where it's Seventy Seventy two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a suburban area in the state of Ohio right and and uh they can say okay here you go\nPretty soon Comcast will be able to do the same thing at all the other Internet service providers\nHere in the United states\nAnd you know which is going to make them even richer but what does it do to us as a country it makes it harder for start ups and get into the Internet particularly if you have to pay extra fees they have high speed transmission it it makes all of us a little dumber\nI mean and then on top of that you've got the algorithms you know Chris Hedges was you're talking about this yesterday the Google algorithm that has said that alter net and a truth dig in and these other progressive news sites\nWill not be spiders there they're not going to track articles that show up on these sites and so these sites traffic is just collapsing and when you're looking for good information that might have a progressive ... to it you won't find it on Google\nAnd many of the other services basically use Google as their front it so you're not going to find it on them either\nAlthough there's really no consequential competition\nSo what does this mean for the United states it seems to me that in the interests of monopoly and ... and the short term profits\nThese companies are buying off legislators particularly the Republican Party but I'm sure that they own a a you know their own little portfolio Democrats or they wouldn't have been able to get a lot you know away with this this long\nThese politicians having sold out to these Internet service providers are now destroying essentially\nOr that a walking up I mean it's as if to say okay the ... one of the reasons Germany has so prosperous is because they have lots and lots of fertile farmland and they've got the Rhine River running right through the middle of the country\nOr one of one company or a five giant companies came along and said we now own all the farmland and we now on the river and anybody who does anything on either one has to do it through us\nHow would that and say that had been done three hundred years ago [noise]\nHow would that have crippled Germany it would have devastated [noise]\nAnd that's what we're doing to the Internet here in the United states\nI find this just pressing\nAnd the fact that there is no discussion about this in any of the corporate media which I'm In my in large and increasingly are holding by Internet service providing companies [noise]\nMakes us and even more dramatic disaster in my

much of his language was what Brock Obama had negotiated for the TPP anyway and uh\nHe's just rebranding and that's when he does he have been you know somebody has an office building and he goes to them and he says hey give me five percent are ten percent and you can put the Trump name on it well that's exactly what he just did with NAFTA and and also you know I Want to make bragging points as they got rid of the investor state to dispute resolution tribunals\nUm turns out that at least I get to the NBA NBC News was correct this morning when Canada said yeah will participate they one of

is your hour and a lot of people want to talk to and Gary in Toronto, Canada and Gary are on the air with congressman poking\nHey I'm thanks for taking my call I guess I wasn't expecting to speak to them but I just wanted to make a journal comment cooked a weapon function I'm a ethical hacker for my company and observing the political system in the United states right now I noticed that the\nSystem is compromised and no matter what you do unless you do a complete lush you're not going to get rid of it\nFor example this person who's nominated I'm being written off as somebody who's a full actually quite an intelligent person I'm dangerous or at least so in some cases\nI'd just like Citizens United was a rout run by Robert Kennedy um he districts will do the same two other legislation\nThat has been settled and and make it so that you have the Citizens United effective you fall on my lead on that\nYeah it was Anthony Kennedy yeah on the Supreme Court but yeah absolutely and and your congressman or but Polk has thoughts on that that's an interesting a metaphor you got to flush yeah ...\nYeah Garry I mean I I hear what you're saying and I think actually what you're saying are saying from Toronto is what I'm hearing often in the district you know people sometimes get really discouraged or you know I've been doing this uh in local state and federal government now for close to Thirty years and uh yeah I I Know the system can work and there is a pendulum swings but when you have\nThings waited like Citizens United or you have things waited like how they're behaving with the Supreme Court nomination it makes people very very discourage the problem is one of their main strategies is discouraged you to the point that you don't care enough to vote because they know the people agree with\nThe progressive side of issues in this country a they have the money we have the people on the issues but if they can somehow dissuade people make them want to think that everything stinks\nA they don't get out they win so there is a real mythology to what they do it in the methodology to what they do and this is a very specific tactic that they put out there um we just have to make sure people understand just the opposite\nWe change the faces of some of these people who don't like what they're doing the Congress and we can really change the way that our government runs\nMarcia in Inglewood Florida you're on the air with congressman poke him\nI think Tom and Hi congressman good to talk to you again Hi Marsha I'm I have a question about um you know there you can count on\nOne hand in five minutes how many times Kavanaugh has literally light that's perjury under a that's a criminal offense and I'm I'm trying to figure out why the Democratic party doesn't bring\nCharges against him and they are they not allowed to bring charges against in state court\nOr why aren't they doing anything about the perjury\nYeah and I would add Bill Clinton was ... was a impeached for perjury and was disbarred he lost his law license for perjury yeah I was in\nSome of this on the most recent you know perjury is around like you know what the yearbook sudden things I you know people would argue whether or not their materials are strong enough that you could get to that level\nI Would argue with people have kind of forgot about 'em because of the very serious allegations by Dr Ford or that we're forgetting that he probably committed perjury for or maybe five times\nIn some previous testimony that I actually I think is more substantial right that he lied bay previously when he was before the Senate for confirmation according to center a former senator Russ Feingold from Wisconsin so\nUm I I think what people have been saying and I think this is probably the most relevant to offer Marcia\nIs that you know I'm we're going to everything we can to stop this nomination for a lot of very valid reasons but should he get through and should we win the majority we can do hearings on this and we can really get to the bottom of this and you know there is a process to impeach I'm not saying it's easy\nBut uh we can certainly do things that we need\nTo if they decide to force a vote\nYeah and this guy is a very interesting time\nTiresome our focus is with us taking your calls the Tuesday edition of the days was mark he's on the road

where he we just did not get to find out almost anything about his record of service and when he was actually doing during that time\nDuring the time he worked for ... yeah I'm Sorry\nHear your call call call waiting kept blocking what you were saying outside or painting or so the Bush\nCongressman your thoughts yeah even John I I think what we're what's happening right now is what's capturing the public's attention and they may not be exactly enthralled by or what happened when he worked under George W Bush because\nNot everyone follows politics as closely as we all do but what they really understand is a when a woman makes a very credible accusation and is really a dismissed\nThe way she's been Dr Ford has been dismissed and then the good old boy a ah I like beer network kicks in I I think that's what's capturing people's attention and saying you know let's have that proper F. B. invite a investigation why wouldn't you want to have it right and this is something that people can relate to very easily and feel\nVery emotionally a boat and I think that's why that just is what's getting most of the attention um yeah I also think that you know his lying in the previous testimony four or five times\nIs a significant but right now I think where the public that is on this moment and Dr Ford's testimony and the other women to I'm a ... now say testimonies but accusations\nAnd what that means moving forward so that's just what's captured the public's interest right now\nNancy and listen to a teen TNN Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress and Tokyo\nYeah I'm One thing I'm worried about listening to Michael Lewis interview which was ... his book should be very very good his articles in Vanity Fair we're absolutely frightening [noise] but I think we're in a really great situation if\nTrump doing something off the wall like you know parents wherever that would really upset China they would cut us off I mean other than you know the\nStuff to make our missiles and everything but like everything you need in the hospital including our drug are from China is there something without appearing to social less you know that the government can do to put this in reverse [noise]\n[noise] yeah well I think Nancy and when it comes to China you know this is all very educated Donald Trump talks a real tough game\nA but don't forget you know when he became president that's when he started getting some of the trademarks for his family businesses right with China and if you really want to address the in my opinion one of the very biggest problems that we have in relation to trade with China its currency manipulation China is a a manipulator of their currency and you can have the best\nBut as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide super ... by human and has harness the power of nutrient rich beads and created a super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own\nCar philosophy of human and us to develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon a superb eats daily supports your cardiovascular health and your blood pressure levels giving you natural energy without the need of a quick caffeine kicker a sugar high we're talking real healthy natural energy\nCall eight hundred and five six eight Ninety eight and he I or go to ... beats dot com and find out how you can get a free thirty eight supply of super ... with free shipping with your first purchase that they had five six eight nine ... nine or Tom's beats dot com\nFeel a one plus one equals boom effect of super ... called eight hundred and five six eight ... nine or go to Tom's beats\nDot com today [noise] kind of something larger poke and taking your calls at ... here\nOn the on the on the days with mark Tuesday edition and Russ in Portland, Oregon here on the air with congressman poking\nYeah cosmic okay and I was just wondering if you heard about the Nineteen eighty five drunken bar brawl in New haven where Brett Kavanaugh\nStarted at by throwing ice another bar patron got into a fight and then I Love everything crushed deadly the guy who ran for governor here in Oregon or several years ago and almost ... almost ... are a legendary\nDemocratic governor John Kasich harbor godly picked up a broker he brokered bar glass and flushed the broken glass of fire to the head of the ... he's a adversary and there was blood all over the place the cops recall there was a police report and those\nKind of drunk and behavior flies in the face in my opinion of what he told the Senate Judiciary committee about his ah he really didn't have any problem with alcohol I think you perjured himself went in and they have bad and um anyway right\nYeah I did I did hear that story I Do concur I mean there's been so many of his roommates and and and others who said a very different story so it does appear that he wasn't truthful or with\nThe Senate but you know something else you bring up that really stood out to me was\nYou know this is a guy who um shows are extraordinary privilege and was shocked that anyone would say no to him or questioned him and his aggressive belligerent behavior based on that uh again just reinforced um his privileged status that he thinks he's oh\nBut in South somehow he's entitled to the seat rather than this is a job interview for the seat and I just I also found that to be pretty extraordinary\n[noise] truck in Missoula, Montana you're wrong with Congress and poking [noise]\nHey congressman a check and you hear me yes\nI stand on if we're looking into caring for women um why are we looking into releasing all the um the cover up of all the Congress men that have been paid off or\nAbusing women ... Ellis then or Cory Booker their accusers I'm Sorry can you say it again\nHe's a he's a suggestion that Keith Ellison ... it was just you know the guy trying to get the same here Keith Ellison by the way the charges against him were just disproven yesterday\nUm and I don't know anything about Cory Booker\nYeah as you know lots of um ... sort of talking point yeah things are male black\nDemocrat and you know yeah yeah it's it's a that's that's awful stuff yeah ... ... or or Oso California here on the air with Congress would poke him\nOh thank you first time a long time and I wanted to ask congressman anyway there's judge appointment off until the next election Republicans\nI'm by the rules they're going by no uh that's the problem if they have a Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski a no they'll have the votes lined up the question is you know is this going to be um a thorough real FBI investigation which everyone's asked for or is this going to be some kind of a\nAbbreviated or more narrow one which then didn't resolve the problem at all or were you have to find that out and hopefully we will this week\n[noise] Gordon full listening to a serious accent and Jasper, Oregon you're on the air congressman folk him\nUh Hi I'm a man and then congressman\nMy question is a camera you hold the Republican a committee to air they vote for Kevin on knowing he's birds are doing so\nIs there any kind of penalty for them outside of handing them out of office\nYeah not really I don't believe so other than a obviously the you know their constituents could say you didn't do a thorough job you didn't do what you were elected to therefore we're not going to keep you in office that maybe your best friend or set\nIs Patti in Fort Lauderdale is her radio you're on the air with cars and poke at\nHome I got him out quickly as canonize telling the truth why he's wearing on foreign foreign destination ... or liable\nMargaret agent any yeah petty interesting um the point to put out there you're right I can I just to me and again I I look at things from a very simple upper mid west perspective if she didn't want the FBI investigation to clear his name uh that alone didn't pass the smell test right like there's something more to it\nAnd the fact that this only happened because Jeff Flake or you know said I'm not going to vote unless you do this or this wasn't asked where by Kevin ... who should have been the person asking for it to clear his name and to me that the biggest problem I see with his story\nWell even Clarence Thomas was all in favor of an FBI investigation or at least the said so you know I mean hey you raised an object to it so Congress and we have about thirty forty seconds later left or what should we be looking for this week\nUh you know we are all about cabinet as far as what you're looking for I think the other thing maybe just to spend a little tension no watches you know Rod Rosenstein was supposed to go to meet with the president last Thursday during the cabinet hearing that got delayed but you know that's still out there and at some point ah that can be done while people are paying attention to the Kevin I'm hearing so\nKeep pay attention to that as well um because that would certainly trigger response around the country\nDo you think Trump initially did that as a way of diverting attention from the cabin I hearing and then when he realized that it wasn't possible he gave up\n[noise] potentially but again who knows if this guy thought like normal people do you could predict it's a little\nHarder yeah there is that is true although I think we're starting to see some trends emerging [noise] you know the con artist and the media manipulator and everything\n... thanks so much for for doing this hour

I like more President Trump says if there is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh lied to Congress that would be disqualified for his nomination to the Supreme\nAnd uh my listeners I had been asking this question for for the weeks maybe a month or so now since this has become more and more uh especially here a few double what if we conclude if we can conclude and and you have and and Kathleen Jamieson has and others have\nThat Donald Trump is president Mike Pence is vice president\nMany of the members of the house and Senate only hold their seats because of the hotels with those two um the ... to people being appointed to the Supreme Court Gorsuch and now Kevin that all of this was the consequences of Russian interference in our election\nIf we if we assume that that's true what do we deal with that\n[noise] well I think that that's a really good question I think that it it's listen uh from my point of view all of this is going to come out all of the repercussions of this are the most likely thing is that is going to happen I think it's a really good question because I think we have to look at us with serious you know it is not a positive thing\nJust generally speaking for our country for their president to go to prison but if it if that's one option or the other option is that China and India and Russia are going to say well now we can't afford to knock off ourselves with every American presidential elections\nThat that option as the best option you ... so I I think the most likely scenario is this past year it was really serious leader ... away because otherwise it's open season uh and I think but I also can basic knowledge that that's not a good thing you know this is not what we want as a nation is to be\nYou know having our leaders be charged with crimes but in a row of our nation you have to do this\nOr having our leaders being ... by other countries governments uh you know we're we have even worse and and there's different different levels of this I mean in the Citizens United dissent Justice John Paul Stevens\nA pointed out that under the under the logic of Citizens United Tokyo Rose would have been afforded the first amendment protection to broadcast directly into the United states her propaganda during World War two and ... and uh if there's like if you look at the spectrum\nOf foreign governments trying to influence us elections you had you know Saudi Arabia and Saudi Aramco three largely in the business community influence in American politics and decisions for decades you have a Israel principally through a pack a day you know influencing politics\nOn a regular basis in the United states supporting candidates and things like that I'm ... I'm I'm sure that the list of countries that\nYou know explicitly overtly we all know about influence our elections is it you know as as got to run to ten to Fifteen countries\nUm what [noise]\nWhat can we learn you know if we don't have a ... you know you're talking about sending Trump to jail I'm I I think that's pretty unlikely but who knows but you know for that or impeachment or those solutions to those wishes get those pounds um although maybe we can teach both\nIs there is there some call to action that is like okay let's pass laws or ... you know\nI mean like like you know LA Stevens pointing out the Citizens United just ripped open this door for any foreign country to come in and do whatever they want the United states legally um is there any way it is their end to the end of your knowledge are there any attempts by the legislators to to change our laws\nYeah so I think that that's a great question I I think that there's there's really two approaches the\nFact that you can't really just address citizens jak directly because she does uphold Seventy six Supreme Court case Buckley ... or so you'd have to actually go further back and overturn Buckley ...\nAnd I'd be I'd be at the top of the list for that that was Louis Paul's thing that was the first step in the ...\nA hundred percent so I I'm I'm all for that I think there's an easier way though and I think that there was a way that you don't have to go to the constitution and this is just sort of a personal idea it might have not heard anybody's justice but that you a tax political spending at a Ninety nine percent right and I do to the sales tax so then it gets passed on to the person spending it\nUh and you would drive massive ... or you could say any contribution over five thousand dollars is one thing that's knocked ever questioned as the government's ability to tax\nI mean the entire purpose of the Philadelphia Convention was so they could level tax write um\nWouldn't they wouldn't a starting point being and just and then he ducked ability of political contributions or are they are they not adaptable either you know I've never tried to I\nI I don't know but I don't think I think that if they I personally don't think they are if they were you would do some amounted to curb it but you could taxes at the highest rate you want to uh and and at that point if you want it taxing the Ninety nine percent you can get rid of\nThat's a fascinating idea um it'd be a comment that I Believe I heard you make on Bill Maher show was about a Trump and putting\nA sitting down when they met in Helsinki uh basically that this was a second you all to the the meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill or where they carved up the world I mean the particularly North Africa and the middle east\nUh can you riff on that from a\nWell I I think that one of the difference there is I think that uh when when Roosevelt installing a ... I think that there was a little bit more of a ... as equals probably one of the interesting thing is is that it was I've been knocked Roosevelt during that conference bugging it uh and so I think\nThat that that is perhaps that analogy I I don't know if I Would certainly can hurt your because I think that\nUm by by strong suspicion is is that at this point a hoot and has so much over Trump that there is not an evenly how hand in any capacity um that that sort of the seats the Cold War we're kind of percolate I go to the circus or with any off in a way I don't think that Trump could afford to to push\n'em and all of a sudden there was bad but it was a ... a bit so I I ... and and I think at this point that\nTrump is especially once you wanted to he became even more a compromised because the real leverage that food and has now is his knowledge of Trump's evolved into thousands exchange\nRight and and there are ... and we have about a minute and a half year until we are going to head heartbreaking my apologies\nBut ah we're totally jak Brian are getting a active measures of the movie star to kind of competing narratives about that one is that Trump has been basically a Russian asset a you know that he's being blackmailed essentially a or owned and the other is that the Trump is just a businessman eager to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and that's why he's trying to keep this relationship open\nWhat are your thoughts what is your what is your research tell you\nI think those are not mutually exclusive I mean our research is that this goes back to the eighties and like any relationship it develops slowly a and for very practical reasons over time\nUh I I think that this is more of a relationship that began as sort of this is a sketchy guy who is comfortable on during your money in the eighties than in the nineties into thousands a guy who was does business was falling apart and he needed the Russians and then it became after ten years of that just a ... a relationship work that was actually serving\nUm and so I don't think that it I don't think anybody came in a room and said hey we're going to blackmail you now I think that they allowed him to know that they're good friends with once you sit on this information so long as he was a good friend yeah uh and so I think it was an all the above approach I I don't think that you need one of the threat than\nFrankly there's evidence for all of these so I think that the evidence shows and it would make sense that this was all the above as opposed to just one threat\nIs there enough I I mentioned two scenarios us or a third or fourth\nYeah I think the third and the most likely I think is that the Russian mafia which is a branch of the Russian government has had a huge position within the Trump Organization Richard out or\nNot and that there's open that there are the reason that he got out of that the reason he has a a business we sort of do you tell us route so ah and I think\nThat knowing that of course I Know what the story of how that goes the more because you know when they uh\nWhen the phone records and obviously the contract was standing and that was a really\nFascinating the movie is active measures the documentary conspiracy hiding in plain sight active measures dot com is a website Jack Ryan is the director and co writer thanking jak great talking with you that\nThis is the Tom are from around the back of more of the news and the day and your calls right after this\nWhat should we do if our president is our president because of a foreign\nCompelling ... on the air and maybe he's toned down time then maybe you\nFeel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nOr the actual executives are cashing out\nThe SEC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading and justice casinos aren't built on winters neither is the stock market is called the welts transfer and you and I are the ones that risk socks are high was a high downside gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever the strategy by low sell high\nIf you want to make insider moves a hedge against the volatile market call my friends that idea and trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an ID I'm precious metals expert and learn the smart money strategies and gold and silver asked for their free investment guy which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven asset call one AAA\nOwned goal that one triple A.
