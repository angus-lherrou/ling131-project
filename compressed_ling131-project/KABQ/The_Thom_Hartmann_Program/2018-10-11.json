sixty five hundred and it'll eventually about where it was last year yeah\nYeah so it it's kind of interesting that that part of it seems to remain relatively stable I think that's our new normal for the last couple of months yeah yeah\nI'm In really I mean it's almost been throughout this whole year that you really ... it has yeah I Would say it's range between five and eight thousand a year but again I'm busy as we come to these conferences and and talk to people really involved in the industry I think\nThe overwhelming consensus is is the prices and the important thing the important thing is the development where this thing's going and what it can do for people fried block chain in bitcoin in and and other digital assets are really about the opportunities that technology can present to us as\nAnd what I'm into that is what we were talking with a ... about last night and I imagine we're going to see him here a little bit and we'll pull over he's a comedian a libertarian comedian um and he's going to be here performing from what I understand but um he was he was the one who said last night that it's been his favorite year encrypted\nThat quote it just nails the foreign and despite the fact that um the price is down right\nAnd and he kind of encapsulate what you would just pointed out which is that you know the reason he's in this and the reason why a lot of us are libertarians are into crypto isn't because all you can make money well you could write in many people have\nBut it's because the money's better because of the potential for that money to basically undermined the status quo of money and empower the individual in a way that\nPrevious generations of money have not been able to do and in fact were important fact designed to distance\nUh the individual because of the currency right wing government print out money they are just empowering you because they're literally taking value from whatever if you've got savings and they print out more money they just devalued what you have in savings right\nEvery bill you have every dollar you own is worth less today than it was yesterday and you know it\nThis is why I think a lot of libertarians you know first of all jumped on to the idea of golden and on astronomy uh but the problem is is I Can't really walk around with all my savings and gold and why I wouldn't be able to walk anywhere right ... and it's difficult to spend in not easily divisible are those are\nOther features of good money that a crypto currency is help solve and if they're programmed correctly which and there certainly are some out there than they can featured the scarcity\nA which is another essential part of good money right so\nA crypto currency meets all of the requirements for not only money but good money right and it's money that again in powers people because it puts the people in charge of their currency and and it's hard to really express\nHow big of a paradigm shift that is right now because you know people look at ... and they say oh that goes up and down in price well some people have made money and you can just sort of on the cursory level say oh that's the thing it's money people are trading at okay\nA but it means so much more to be able to put people in charge of their money and and we were explaining or some crypto to you were doing a great job yesterday of actually we got you got the bartender\nOr here at the hotel right number one seed crypto for tips and then the waitress at the restaurant we were at last night the restaurant we were at takes crypto currency right here in downtown port Smith and now the waitress that we had\nA got her first crypto wallet and you know we're just kind of explaining this ah to folks and it's it's interesting of course seeing seeing their reactions um and you know it's I don't know where the hell I was going with that it's ... it's bright and early ... here we are literally here ah you know before ... am for those that don't know\nA free talk live does recorded shows whenever we're live in and on location so we're actually here live and we're recording it live\nA but in order to make it so that we can we can bring guest speakers in and talk to folks and and just kind of do a better show correct uh we we record the ... the shows here\nBut uh I don't know it was it was going to be some kind of a general comment about 'cause they're currently empowering people\nI I think it was just really interesting that both people were more or less familiar once we explained that there's going to be a whole bunch of people around this weekend yeah uh that won't be middle weekend thank you I feel like a wait and Wednesday it's up there right now I think it's because I had a beer to last night so it feels like a weekend\nWell it it does because you know it's a conference and in conferences are normally held on on weekends but this one's different and uh and I suspect us because it's hard as hell to get a hotel a yes on a weekend during leaf beeping season here but yeah I mean you were you were explaining this these folks and it's like hey if you get a crypto while it set up this weekend\n... ... over the next two days now where you're going to run it you're going to be very very happy at the end of these two days yeah is if you're the bartender in a hotel where they're having a crypto conference everybody's got like almost everybody's got crypto on their phone Brian they're gonna want if they know you can take crypto for a tip\nThey're going to want a tipping and they're probably going to tipping better yeah because you know instead of a dollar for a drink you might get a five dollar tip or something like that you know it was nuts last night I mean we\nHold it hold that thought we can

the former presidents of the free state project\nA you know just a roving ambassador so a view what were you on for like a couple of years years how long it was just two years as president and I'm Still on the board okay um and so you stepped down to pursue other\nInterests yes coming like that [noise] including burning man of burning man which I just got back from yeah\nThis is a fascinating thing I've yeah I've been interested in burning man for a for a long time but I've never actually been out there\nIt's it's definitely a a strange cultural phenomenon it's been going on for a long time I'm much like the free state project I'm the desk now has been founded many many a time I'm not a on on Bernie manned as being quote over ... doubts yet sold out and also over um\nBut uh yeah it's going strong or Seventy plus thousand people at the third largest city in in Nevada for the week yeah [laughter]\nUm but I find it really fascinating and um the thing you know the thing that really keeps keeps drawing me back to it as a volunteer with an organization they're called the rangers and the black rock rangers and it's an all volunteer\nA participant community mediator peace keeper deer go waiting non coercive help bringing organization okay the department of the of the organization\nAnd trying to help keep the peace but it was about how bringing help to people who need it and often that you know pointing out where the nearest port at Johns are also we can also slum in medical fire\nLaw enforcement you know when that's actually necessary because the tuition is exceeded what we can do right as regular people\nBut I always think it's a you know it's really interesting to see how a large community like that\nSelf organized ... I'm In a way to try and get help to the people who need it um you know in a timely fashion right arm and most of the time it's non course if there are few and there there are a few situations where we do have to report it to law enforcement like if there's an assault or um or domestic violence situation\nThere Seventy thousand people in a place there's a chance there's somebody is going to get violent especially with with the environment they're being as as harsh as it is you know there's it's hot during the day after I hold at night at ... the you know a lot of people are doing a lot of drugs you know that can take a toll even on an otherwise\nYou know harmonious relationship it can get a little stressful I'm over time\nAnd I I find it interesting anytime anything like burning man or you know talk of a libertarian society comes up people immediately say well this will never work for you because you don't have ... which is provided by the state\nUm but in your case I mean this sounds like like people trying to be good neighbors trying to look out for each other um\nAnd doing it voluntarily I mean that should be the model a there are\nMany aspects of burning man which I think we as libertarians can look to as a model for how to do things and a lot of that is around um when I called rule to uh you know we have the rule one courses don't hurt people and don't take their stuff and enroll too is you know don't be a jerk gray and\nOther libertarians are a lot of libertarians don't understand that\nThey don't understand that and and you can even take that kind of a step further and say don't just don't be a jerk but like how people take a second to help people out and what that does is that ... in a lot of cases the need for having any kind of either state\nUh organized you know law enforcement or even any kind of organized welfare program right if we can just come together as a community members as neighbors\nAre people who um you know go to church together or you know ... whatever your your definition of community as and burning man it's just one big community right\nUm then we we can all get along a lot more easily and it really makes it harder for people to say oh well look like this is a you know these people aren't getting help they need so obviously we've got a tax every one and and have a welfare program right we can we can talk all kinds of different things about libertarianism but when it comes down to is\nThere's a lot of power in a good word and a lot of power and a good turn and if we do those little things than uh you just suddenly see the need for other um other solutions that society likes to turn to go away\nYou don't need it right and there are some things about Bernie men that aren't particularly ... Lee libertarian there's the whole gift at ... I was going to bring back into the outline what what that is yeah the little the donor so I'm well first of all the only thing that you can actually buy at Bernie man that that's being sold the ticket official hey there's the ticket um\nAnd then there's up to what a few hundred bucks several hundred it's about four hundred or a little over four hundred Nevada recently passed a an event tax for live events\nLarge than fifty thousand which applies to groaning math well Bernie man and a couple of conventions eat three or something like that right no because those are all those are those are different those aren't handled it it's just ... the the electric days are I Would\nReally just do like ... and\nUm it's a pretty shameless you know yeah I have a new grab a state but\nSo you can buy ice ... you know sort of a health and safety thing right yeah like during the day came right up over a hundred degrees and\nPeople need to keep their food you know cold sort of the oil and medicines and stuff like that you can buy coffee because let's face it caffeine is you know a ... they're the ones that well it's a state approved drug and if people are going to\nSomehow um but other than that um everything is is what's called the gift economy so if I have something that I think you might enjoy I can offer it to you mhm with no expectation of you know anything in return on just doing it\nWhich is it it's seems like a kind of economy thing right like uh the the idea is just give everything away and you know and it'll come back to you and there's some sort of universal truth to that\nBut does this really work out because it seems like they want\nThis to happen on a larger scale they want the gift economy to become more than just a you know a week and a black rock desert or were you also see it at a rainbow gatherings for it right\nWell there there was a couple of different directions to go in that one and courses yeah you know everybody always finishes a week of Bernie Madoff had gosh I Wish that we could just do this all year long and then you look at how much it takes and ... resources in order to get out there on because\nYou had to bring everything ready to bring all your ... and you got to pack it all out and travel expenses cetera and then it and then at the end of the year they do a survey and they always ask you know how much did you spend while you were in the state of Nevada and non funds fuel and lodging all that\nThere's sort of trying to make the case to the local community there like hey I Know it's a drag to have Seventy thousand people show up in your backyard\nUm you know all the driving over your your front lawn huge economic reduce the norm is economic a boon to that whole region's economy you know it's a it's outside of Reno nevada you know friend not a whole lot else going on up there yeah and when you talk to ... to have your outside of Vegas or ... yeah you know I just outside\nI'm so so that's one aspect of it the other aspect and I think this is you know maybe something that\nWe can also you know sort of philosophically consider is that there's more than just um you know specific tokens or dollars or whatever you want to call it that get exchanged in any kind of interaction with each other right and you and and\nYou need a little bit with the black mirror episode about the reputation rankings right where we get that with love that one you know with what we used to be with Yelp or or ... or or ... the whole reputation economy right where it's not just the money that you're paying its ... year behaving in that in that economic transaction right that's actually\nA pretty big part now of what we think about and what we look at as economic actors and so it's important to\nConduct yourself right in a certain you know a certain way\nSo we'll go to ... get better treatment overall exactly so I might I might gift something to you out at Bernie man but I'm I'm also you know it's that sort of what goes around comes around right I'm In the community of people who understand that there there shouldn't be there should be no spectators I everybody should be participating\nEverybody should be pulling their own weight\nAnd that when it comes time to it you know if I'm Still going on in the middle of the hot summer you know hot button of the day and somebody walks up and says hey this is the ice cold you know a lot to say that I you know just made them handing out I'm like awesome things that actually hit the spot\nSo um and that's I think part of what we're stumbling up again in this whole effort to promote decentralized ... um you know both from it sort of technological ... standpoint but also from the community are sociological standpoint is how do we\nCreate this decentralized society that we want to the ... um what are the pieces that we need what are the alternative social institutions that we need in order to make sure that when we make a decision about who we are going to interact with you know from an economic standpoint [noise]\nUm you know whether it's safe to do that whether I can trust somebody to do that and you know you look at them in the corner crypto currency part of the magic of that right is I don't have to trust you like you transfer it I can see that it's been transferred it goes into the immutable ledger all the all the accounting happens for that\nAwesome but there are other economic interactions we have where we need a little bit higher level of ... not just about transferring currency and providing a good there's actually like an ongoing ongoing relationship there right\nNow so I I think about that a lot I don't think we as a society have a lot of the answers yet I think we're you know people would look at ... the rating system whatever\nYeah that's a good start but it out to be a lot richer and a lot more integrated into how we do things as a society\nFor sonics yeah to some extent we are still kind of learning and now we're always going to be learning about interacting with each other and and improving on that\nUh you know I Do find myself wondering about that the gift economy and it gives it seems more like a fantasy right it seems more like a kind of a left wing fantasy that oh well all these rich or communists you know put their money together like in a rainbow gathering a which I've never been to but I've I've known who have gone to these things I've heard the stories\nAre where there's all this food just being given away it's like oh well you that's very nice of you to buy all that food but is this really you know our resources really going to be allocated correctly where there's no prices on things right is what the sustainability couldn't possibly expand beyond a week right like\nI I doubt that it it really could hum and all of a all of the you know price than resource allocation activity that the free market you know does the well happen you know\nIn Reno the day before you know that in the car and drive out there and then on the way back you know when you have to pay five dollars a bag for your trash yeah um so yeah it is a little bit of a of a bubble where those\nThat the free market is really only just either I'm pre allocated or delayed by those few days so interesting I was yeah I don't I don't know how you would scale that really anything longer than a week or so is burning man at the deterioration is basically long enough before collapses [laughter]\nPeople I mean I mean this is this is a long time topic of discussion is how did you hear any man all year and the answer is if you can't ... at least not well then it wouldn't be ... it right on right now what's the point\nOh well they're they're trying to do this thing where they they are pushing down to the regional events in fact we just had firefly which is in early July ... or early June\nWhere is that it's a it's usually in Vermont relative like on a New England in that one yeah it's a New England um regional burning man event cool um and that's for a long weekend and I am actually made it there yet but burning man as a as a ...\nOrganization or as a movement is trying to push down so that all the people who can't afford to get out to the harsh environment or the bike rack desert yeah every year 'cause it is it's\nDaunting is daunting I've looked at and it's like oh my God just the amount of water you've got a pack out is insane right what is it a gallon a day for one person\nOr something like that and like that depending on how you do it yeah\nUm so so so everybody who can't do that there's all these I think that's up to there is some sixty some odd regional events around the world um throughout the year and Tom including in places like Africa and there's mid burn in Israel um and uh Australia has got a couple of 'em so\nThere's a lot of different opportunities to experience that same sort of culture and at the event culture and the burning man culture\nI'm a little bit closer to home and I I really do think that for a lot of libertarians who like again you know we've talked about it sounds like a bunch of communist out in the desert\nHold that thought can you stick or another segment 'cause I Know that there's a libertarian community forming within burning man so we'll talk about that come up here on free talk live from the free state block chain digital assets conference the\nSecond one in Portsmouth New Hampshire\nLet's talk comfort let's talk about\nDown home values fade and the usa blue jays\nLike you more as a kid I\nOh\n\nYou're in the way they\nVoted

[laughter] some people are organized showers they either getting watery trucking in water or they um you know you you can get like a ... hour kind of situation going on but\nNow that the water trucks aren't giving that away that's for damn sure right so they're not buying the water trucks outside they're sending men are they giving away the showers to evoke\nWell so people there's there's a whole gift there's like a dark runners camp where they basically do host communal open and shower situation there but you're right\nThere are water truck and there was also you know a RV service trucks to come and pump out your RV life and so there are little bits of capitalism happening sort of along the way yeah I guess the question is is is all that are enough as it satisfactory or\nBecause you're sort of working without the normal incentives that we have in society [noise]\nUm well do you all need to get mad when it comes to were just talking about basically water and then yeah but for those basic things and and those are vendors who have to get you know a vendor license from the event and a lot of it is regulated by the by the state of Nevada\nUm so uh there's plenty of that you know all those sort of needs are met all the rest of it you know a lot of it is just putting your hand up and saying hey I Need a rat or that and somebody's got one you know like oh I Need a drill cause I'm putting together this structure the camp across the Street's gonna have one and they're going to want it to you it's not a big deal\nGotcha so what's the point of the libertarian group that is a you formed so I think partly to um you know uh for those of us who who go and enjoy it for whatever reason that we do to have a a smaller enclave within the community of like minded individuals who can get together and either\nCelebrate the libertarian aspects of the event or commiserate about the lack of of\nOf stay why five which is a seems to be a perennial problem for a year in the middle of nowhere really in the middle of nowhere like ... years not only not wife I bet you can't really even get a a cell phone signal that slowly changing their your slowly getting a little bit better than our cell service but you know if you wanted to buy something with bitcoin know it'd be it'd be pretty tricky\nSo will the burners recognize that the free market is slowly bringing them why fi service to burning man I mean that's the question right\nYeah and then of course there's all the you know the ... being a you know social media happening where Paris Hilton comes with her you know iPhone which is provided by the free market and snapping pictures and posting them on a gram of service that yeah it's paid for with advertising and\nDone a lot of these uh Paris Hilton types like flying on a helicopter basically like ... come in for a little while and then leave\nThey don't do helicopters because of the hospital mostly it's fixed wing aircraft but there are people that do fly in and fly out um and there's a lot lot of critique around now there's a whole discussion in a community about I'm a I'm about these camps where basically you come in and you pay in some cases you know thousands of dollars and you've got your\nRV set up for the week it's stocked with water and food and right um you know everything's paid for and um the they just shut out and you know is that in the spirit of Bernie man or not and they're trying to sort of\nManaged that over time so that it doesn't just explode into a you know only the wealthy can go and can afford to go and all that so that's an interesting ah you know trends to to be watching how does a community that has these ideal\nYou know try to promulgate them through culture rather than just making homes rules that you know and how long have you allow your heroes they're\nRight and a lot of the heroes of that of that community are the Silicon Valley um you know elite sure who come and they spend literally millions of dollars to put together these big sound camps are these make art pieces\nAre incredible which are incredible um and they're giving that as a gift to the community um\nThat's one of the real attractions of burning man is going to actually see not just the burning man aspect but the demand burning but all the other art installations that they have what are example\nThere was a seven forty seven out on the plight of this year how that was basically converted into a ... you know at night clubs like you know you go up and you're dancing inside of a seven forty seven and go get eight but the logistics of getting a seven forty seven out there and that and then back because remember to leave no trace event\nRight you know so you got all be cleaned up by the end of the week and the TSA I mean did they check everybody getting out on a sunny and all that is that the did you want to say the camp ... organized that whole around you know they're the volunteers but they had that were ... you know doing basically making sure not too many people got on at once they were wearing these sort of like\nBe dazzled blue TSA alight uniform uh that's on the nice\nYea editors and even if it's of course speaking of these things is just you know doesn't do them justice you've got to the very least see some photos and videos of these installations but they're still probably nothing like actually being there to experience that\nAnd thanks for sharing at least a little bit of what has to be at burning man with us ... Philip former president of the free state project good to see and I'm sure we'll see it at the very least that to an archipelago yeah like right All right good to talk to you indeed we get more free ... coming up here on day number one at the free state block chain\nDigital assets conference here in Portsmouth New Hampshire there's more coming up\nAnd walk around the block Harry\nHow\nHow do you get three you can get tickets are great for how the scanner\nI'm shiny count I Would really recommend\nPeople starting puppies or they get into what I Would\nThink if they're getting their vitamins my my ... probably not going to have a problem with the\nVitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out most commercial dark foods dying to fight for life this is Lucas Arabic can be look authentic inviting you and your pets to diner by\nFive an hour [noise]\nWhat's more profitable running your business or doing bookkeeping doing your business of course but you want to keep your book so that you can maximize your tax savings right what if I told you that there's a person that's a book keeper accountant and law school graduate that's also a hardcore libertarian\nMy name is Melanie Johnson and I hate to state I Will aggressively help you to minimize your tax exposure and to maximize profits all well staying within the law\nMelanie is your best choice for your taxes and bookkeeping needs tax free talk live dot com and check out our website tax free chocolate dot com\nDot com wants you to know about David ... dot com since launching into doesn't\nFourteen over two hundred thousand users have saved an average of Fifteen Percent combined for a million dollars using bitcoin or BTC and now you can use bitcoin cash PCH to find your account you can save between five to thirty three percent on things you're going to buy any way when you shop using save it per se dot com at items to your cart\nFund your account select your disc out and save save at ... dot com\nSave eighty per se dot com\nFine and is free talk live well into free you got ... that can survive for fifty free\nCell [noise]\nAll right yeah like what is you to get five hundred thousand a day or\nSomething like that and other yeah where where where we're on a path like the technology is working it's getting better every day like I'm very happy with the progress that we've made but I wouldn't say that I'm satisfied with where we\nAre satisfied with participation people are actually getting involved they're excited about it it didn't fail yet\nYet I still like last week I think um that we had more than thirty thousand unique up people and it's also tough to track that precise there are some people might turn off track which case we don't know I so ah I ah but yeah at least thirty thousand people use that I worked ...\nYou've got a nice looking G.

you're listening to talk live out in the live there for three that age if the five four fifty three\nNew Hampshire ... one of the day flushing\nDigital assets conference the second year of a wonderful event\nIt's a it's intimate it's fun it's a good crowd and people coming in from all across the country so far um I imagine there's gonna be some international folks here just a it's it's still early yet we haven't had a chance to really do much of anything besides barely had breakfast yeah there's a there's a little bit a little bit of breakfast\nAnd ah it's great being here in Fort Smith 'cause it's the other crypto capital of of New Hampshire and its effect arguably the crypto capital of New Hampshire I think they have more crypto accepting businesses here in Portsmouth\nThan even we do out in Keene\nAnd ah so ah oh by the way I Want to make sure you know that free chocolate has brought you buy bitcoin dot com so if you are new to crypto currency you're hearing us talk about\nUh things here today and tomorrow we always tried our best\nTo bring whatever discussion we're having down to a level that the average person can at least grass or have some understanding of of what we're talking about 'cause couldn't do can get so deep it can get so technical and so it's really important for us to try to remember\nYou know you're out there listening you probably aren't an expert in crypto currency him odds are you're not so we want to make sure this understandable or for you and that's what they do over bitcoin dot com is they've got the bitcoin academy which can help you understand crypto currency the basics learn the basics the not too late you know we're still in the first decade of this stuff\nSo I get on board go to the point dot com start learning and then you go to the news site and get the latest news headlines and what's going on in the world is a big ... crypto currency sold their over at the coin dot com or we've got Jeremy ... with us here are from the library which is a exciting\nDe centralized media\nProtocol where people are sharing space on their hard drives for instance and sharing a videos and you you mentioned that it's sort of got the seeding aspect of like a bit torrent but it's much more than that there's also others who\nAre are just hosting huge amounts of uh of content used there's over five hundred thousand um mostly videos\nOr on the system is it also audio what are the some of the other ... you\nSee as as a as a political doesn't care right right right I used to distribute a cat file oh really oh you'd asked me being an excel spreadsheet you're there aren't a huge not not many people are distributing ... to network of it it can distribute Avon okay it's\nIt's it's it's I think I I think I could probably safely say that like over Ninety percent of them are videos like videos of ... uh as it continues to grow I Do expect we'll see more of other types and there definitely are albums we're musicians you publish or stuff on ... and so on but the the interface is definitely very much set up for a video\nYeah and this was a lot of what I was most impressed the first time I saw it was I'm like well this looks just like yeah I mean it has a very you to feel to it it it looks like a lot of um sites that you you go to on a regular basis so it's the user interface I thought was really important you guys get\n... yeah it is and I thank you for that I mean something I'd say a lot of our company is that I'm watching is uh how NATO why are so right right you shouldn't use a product or service because block\nRight you should use the service because it has some that are probably at work better right does the answer you know I think it's great I'm sure your audience is they enter and if people want to get into the tech side of it like we can go to we have a website I'll be a wide attack\nWhich can tell you all about the attack and how it works but for an end user like I Want my mind you ought to use the software you shouldn't need to do anything about ... to ... and so that's definitely what we're aiming for the\nGood so rich Chris you had a question about incentives in library yeah\nUm and this is one of those things that that happens in real life and it happens in businesses happens our personal lives we do things because we are incentivized to do things and\nI this is just my ignorance about the library system um what are the incentives for me to participate what are the incentives for me to put up content or to share my hard drive or whatever\nThat's a great question so it depends on what I'm looking at a depends on what your role or how you are participating so if you're a creator the incentive to to to do it is to um\nMake money off of your content for simply to have more people see it or to publish it in a way where you're not reliant on a company that can change the rules on you at any time or to hide out beyond the rights to separate that from the creator side from the end user side the incentive is\nOne just like finding good stopped binding interesting stuff finding it'd be a technology again that maybe as a little bit more aligned with what\nThe way that you think this stuff should work like maybe you don't like that you're spending all this information to Facebook and Google and bigger companies and ... you could like for those reasons\nUm there is also a reason to um participate which is like it's just kind of like a good thing to do right at the same way that this is why we could be a works this is why traffic works right people are are nice revenue injects um and there is also in a there is technically speaking market aspect to the data\nSo you could maybe earn money for contributing to the space and been with but I Want to be clear\nBut in reality in so many people do choose to host for free like if you tried like most likely you won't burn very much I could write on many people are participating at the free level but there is an aspect where if content got super scarcer content was disappearing than those incentives might become a large enough right so we do want the network to have this sort of like\nUm what else sometimes called like an anti fragile property where like as things start disappearing there's more incentives for other people to pick them up to host them in to put this but\nI was just thinking of Alex Jones data\nAnd a guy had up there are so um it is not well we we did reach out to them or we didn't get an answer but where your work setting everything right like I'm personally not a huge Alex Jones fan but I think that what happened to him was absolutely ridiculous I I thought it was actually the anymore yeah yeah\nAnd we watched that closely here are on free talk live um because you know if it can happen Alex Jones it can happen to anybody else right and and we've seen a lot of people get the carpet pulled out from under them in on these websites and then poof your videos are gone you didn't have\nThree successive acts of outrageous tyranny well anyway the point is that this guy is a professor of engineering at\nMassachusetts Institute of technology that this this is terrible way to somebody to tell the truth about what's happening and to find some way for us to protect ourselves from this oppressive government\nAnd his name was Edward Harwood and he established the Americans to for economic research to do that and over the course of the decades it's been around the eighty five years it's had this big focus on free enterprise very human liberation but mostly on found money\nAnd we're still around and we've got you know uh I think like a hundred and Seventy acres in western Massachusetts wow they'll they'll during the thing of doing the research and\nAnd now the president said was bringing my old friend who's a like a solid and our co capitalist I'm going to say and uh we're bringing in more research isn't doing really cool stuff every day\nNow you're based out of Atlanta and this is an organization in Massachusetts are you flying back and forth a lot er yeah I got a lot of back and forth and so you're up in our neighborhood a lot\nGetting to know the northeast better which is a big country there's some like my ancestors are from this area of the country but they laugh\nBasically an Eighteen thirty when when Texas look it up and there's an advertise advertisement all over New England or like\nYour life life kind of socks a cold or so so come to Texas and you can be free\nAnd you might get rich and people were like yeah OK has gotten I laughed so coming back here is a little bit like reaching into my deep ... genetic passed and trying to understand what my actual ancestors were doing for a couple of hundred years here which is where they lived\nUh in Massachusetts mostly and um\nAnd I think things have probably changed a lot around here I mean this must have to say my impression doing but\nIt's less free than the south and\nI'm a fan of particular about western Massachusetts is less than the east coast of freedom there's there's a presumption of control and the culture and and the two sons west Massachusetts on the ... I mean there's just like everything is controlled like fat issues ... says oh yeah\n... ... ... people like you get a viral me was like oh plastic bags are destroying their and then the bushes like well this band them\nThat sounds like you know or like here's a turtle was so strong as knows well that's the worst thing ever lose banned them a ... or so\nWe just saw one of those papers draws last night they've got 'em here at the hotel I was looking at I'm like that's one of those papers straw I saw those when I was down in D. C. recently and I almost grabbed one and then I was like wait this is just gonna like wind up turning in to do the uh in in the water hack words you know the more government you have\nThe more you just turn back history and that's that's happened in the shower in the hotel and I'm staying at us but that it can be like they never would have put up such a crappy show in Nineteen forty or this is the worst I've ever had and now we just take it for granted that it's just going to trickle out and\nSo I I Want us to want to add something to what you pointed out about Massachusetts and you made it made a statement about New England I think it's important for our listeners to understand New Hampshire is not meant to say this\nIs my second point is that the ... the beauty of Portsmouth yeah which is I think how you pronounce it ripe Portsmouth I think so rather than a cordless mouse yeah OK Portsmouth is that you get all the beauty and glory of New England culture without the politics of Massachusetts I mean\nThis is so far this is my favorite town of ... and the whole of New England because\nUm there's a feel of freedom and they put a decompression and friendliness that come with freedom\nBut also you get all the beautiful new things on architecture and the charm of those the side and el ... and ... and one of the food so you get all the best of New England live out the worse than I like writing right here so I I feel it I Know that\nWhen you have like one day I notice All right I mean as soon as you come into New Hampshire or you can take off your seatbelt if you want to you know you can take your helmet off if you're a motorcycle rider I mean there's the choices people have and it's like what you're saying the other day\nFreedom is the ability to say no you are and in New Hampshire youth has more abilities to make a choice a than you do just a few miles south in Massachusetts the yeah the distinction is drastic ah between\nThe ... I mean I've got a good intuition about politics and but I'm In western Massachusetts I just feel like it's like I'm about to get in trouble [laughter] for everything that I Do you know just walking along a man you have you with reading from it you know it's like that it's like there's a central plan that runs well\nYou do and you don't help carbon dioxide in carbon dioxide is a pollutant or something\nYeah well it's but even even in like driving along the parking lot\nIn the parking lot in a at a grocery store in the ... you know sometimes you see a play them but you know that you're not supposed to go that direction of the parking I'd be like whatever 'cause I'm just driving over here\nAnd do you do that Massachusetts You're going to get done out like people will announce he'll you know whereas in Georgia people like just park where everyone however you want as long as you get it done and we're good so it's it's a different culture but he by I'd I'd I think New Hampshire\nHas more of that culture that I used to in Georgia you know the the gumption that you're free you know that you you can be engaged in spontaneous action that we don't need a central plan running or life I mean that seems to be New Hampshire you wouldn't think state line that make that much difference but it just it seems to\nThink that does us if you've got a gun in New Hampshire and you accidently cross that state line in Massachusetts ... even if you were completely legal in New Hampshire you are now you know in felony territory I think just because of the arbitrary political designation\nI don't know what what kind of a sudden it's like you could speculate along tend to like what's interesting amassed his New Hampshire has something to do with the elite power the Yankee culture in Massachusetts just got really\nHe's paid ... and the guy converted to kind of a socialist ideology or something I'm not sure but the ruling class still exist or you can just see limits everywhere but how much of the rural areas but certainly in Boston and and I don't know you have to say in the ... it's pretty about\nThe uh do do the Berkshires have their own Burke shares local\nWhat do you have to kind of a left the local ... you know I'm all about that a fact I had a conversation with somebody recently about that I wrote a big article about the up to ... we keep trying to invent some money the not the dollar you know we keep going at it\nThere's a problem with those are based on the dollar the Berkshires or go to the dollar and they're very much like the the old ... an hour\nYeah yeah yeah yeah it was like a labor base current through current law I Love it I made a slow to hundreds of thousands of these things all over the world that that's great but\nAnd this is why we love ... throughout your chance to have a universal um means of exchange and ended up count and store values sometimes I'm a\nNice thing about crypto as far as local currencies is concerned even though bitcoin is really international ultimately has occurred currency\nIt also has a very local feel to it like when you go into downtown Portsmouth which you should do at some point and go eat at a place where you can pay with crypto currency like oh really did last night multiple restaurant downtown wears down town we're in it\nAll kinds of words were just walk around here you walk around here we're gonna continue to stick with us we're done more with Jeffrey Tucker ...\nFolks this is very important information what's to be said about CBD\nAre CBD is made from hemp and has point zero zero three T.

a device so mean like people people are just being ... each other because of you know the difference of opinions about cabin on ... and now you've got the left in this country like\nWorse than mark

things that are going to bring us together to get pass all this crap and I think ... it's like the perfect\nWay to develop human community because people like money that's for sure but it's and it's a it's a tool of peace you know and it really is that by passes for a while we touched on this earlier in the shows\nHow you know bitcoin you mentioned the tool of peace when you're taking money out of the hands of the government and you're taking it out of the hands of the bank and you create basically an inflation proof\nA system that benefits the average individual instead um that keeps money in the hands of the people and it's money that the government can't just reaching ... which is what they can do with inflation that's ... that's the\nCritical thing cause you to carry an ownership and therefore dignity of human being\nAnd therefore freedom you know there are all connected\nAnd we've needed this just to be reminded that the world can be a beautiful wonderful place and because of the best symbol\nAnd tool for making that possible right now I Can't think of anything else the comparison so well when did the Atlanta because it was the opened its doors are not even a year ago so it was last January and and it and it came about because because of you know it's like ... because I\nI just got back from Tel Aviv where they have a Tel Aviv that Clinton but they\nA few of them around the globe yeah yeah\nYeah there's er an am and Montreal I think yeah much wrote but I think that will close though that wasn't closed I think a Paris is that still open I'm not sure there were other\nThere are a couple of other ones are in the United states that weren't calling themselves embassies there was one in Manhattan for years which\nWas called the ... center yeah yeah I like the word embassy because the idea of the embassy as it's not subject to the laws of the country and ... so you go into the embassy and and it's like a safe they're going to stay safe about Julian ... yeah yeah yeah it's a sanctuary for free thought and\nUh it's where you go to get away from a basically a lot of the nation states apply a number of things so and of course the laws of nations they do apply and the kind of busy but nonetheless it shows are aspirations you know we can say that\nThey want to re I liked I liked the term empathy and I enjoyed being at the television but the and finding my people\nYou know and we can all talk and and be friends that I developed really intense friendships there you know\nUh just over a technology wouldn't technology with capable of creating human going into Tibet it actually can most importantly and it it helps you de politicized and get out of the political as partisan battles of our time\nAnd and actually embrace something that about human ... and dignity and and and finally value in each other and and I wanted a place is a co working space but it's also I think most importantly a place for ...\nThe engagement you know for attracting people people come from all over the doors are open people getting anytime oh it's always ... yeah yeah\nFive days but then you are by special appointment on Saturday and Sunday but then the the the the real central events is a Wednesday night we were we call it a ... a cocktail party\nI saw a picture of this on ah your social media\nSo it goes on every week and there's always a different crowd

started the Web site we started the ... the Web but the Web page and we got Facebook groups of course Facebook doesn't go anywhere any more than a useless and Twitter you gotta have a follow it's we've got to have big shots are free to that helped us somewhat because our biggest or\nHelp has been meet up dot com actually I agree yeah use it to so and I wouldn't have expected that but we uh you know I needed to promote the of the cocktail parties I uh went to a moderation is better to put it up on a meet up\nAnd meet up we'll promote your stuff for you basically they find people with similar

I don't know I said let's do men and then it just became a thing we kept growing so wait you just happen to go to this what brought you to an end to end the fed rally in the first a lot of um\nHead scratching uh I'm In I Would buy train I'm a real estate agent so uh I got in like a four oh five\nAnd I just wide right before the crash right yeah and it was just like people moving money hand over like it was just insane the amount of money being moved around a hundred and six percent loans and all this stuff and it just had me like\nI don't buy the way I didn't pay attention to politics or anything like before that but it was just like when I was all this plus I smoke a lot and I'm a I Love marijuana yeah so ... able to look at like the uh the laws and the way that all that stuff is structured right I'm Tommy Chong the documentary about Tommy Chong ... or ... or whatever it was or whatever it was called\nLike it's just a really ugly story what happened to him and a lot of things like that where they tore down his his bomb making yeah true yeah to heck with it but it was in the American drug war so I like to watch all these documentaries or whatever but\nYeah so that just kind of got me looking at government and laws and all that stuff and then before you know what I was like sort of put your eggs in any basket just in my opinion especially back then and it's kinda tough to change it now is like\nBlaming the bartender at this point like these ... were trashed drunk stop pouring alcohol glasses just let them go and like you know so my at my attitude then was just like let's look at the Federal Reserve and you know I didn't care about presidents or any of that with our\nLike turn you on to that because I mean the average you wouldn't say the average person would be like oh yeah let's check into the Federal Reserve see why there's you know screwing\nYou follow the money all the time or you follow the money and then they'd be like look it's still it's so silly how obvious and slap in your face that is at the very top says better reserved note yet the bridge from what's in front of a lot of them I don't know\nLike it's a dollar oh yeah yeah I Know what that is right um so that's kinda got me at least looking at it definitely the Ron Paul campus because I looked at like maybe I should pay attention to politics on both sides and everybody and like all the way down to like Mike rebel and all these people I didn't know\nSo it didn't make a difference to me whether it was on which side of the aisle they were on what color you know sure Jay were wearing but it was like a I just want to listen to what everybody was saying when Ron Paul started talking about the drug war run and then the whole uh they're they're real famous thing about him like saying wait hold on we're borrowing money from China to give all this\nAnd you just walk through this whole thing to give it away\nAnd it's to maybe go wait a second so from there I just started looking at that point yeah ...\nI was like so we can argue all day about uh\nTaxes or abortion or like just pick a pick a topic or whatever but I think it all boils down to the ...\nYeah like anybody can have these ideas that they want to these collective groups can come along and say hey we're the Democratic committee or where the you know new Honda Civic committee and we decided that everybody's going to drive Honda Civic since like cute but once they start getting funding for it and guns behind and everything's would well this is and if you'd anymore you know they're not allowed hold on not cute and cuddly so\nYou got the money freedom aspect that's what kind of brought you into drugs and celebrate marijuana you a good thing to do great things together right marijuana and cash\n'em and uh and so that obviously lead you into the world is crypto currency at some point because well the fed wasn't ending I think you mentioned this last night like you know right up to having these rallies and they didn't go away I'm so instead why don't we just out compete them with better money\nWe so uh I guess [noise] give marijuana credit one night so we didn't want to end the fed rally we did a second in the fed rally where we marched to the vet and all of a sudden this one night it's just got like this you know some smoke and you're like oh this is really the great idea so I said let's start from the fed and march away from it\nAnd this was before we were already trading and sober yeah like what private Lee and stuff like that so um [noise] let's start at the vet turned our backs on it and that was the theme of the march all the time talking about going to go and we would scream at all like the gold shops and like a two year when we walked by whatever so um [noise]\nAll of a sudden and we started trading in silver but all of a sudden this bitcoin came out we're like okay what's driving right like I you know I have a bit about this like I have a shirt that I bought\nFor twenty dollars in debt coin one bitcoin was ten dollars [laughter] thirty dollars work and my thought in my bag or write to me as like how to be comfortable it's often\nAnd it's got like the liberty bell and the bitcoin logo and everything like that but um\nWe weren't thinking about it as an investment we were just like let's give it a shot and ... you know I'm I from what can I talk about this all the time it's like put on a bunch of due to just lived in New Hampshire I wanted to pick off ... ... paper coffee what their smartphones and then look shut the whole financial world like you know so um\nJak you were running very long but quickly what was your reaction to Donald Trump's ... opinion piece in USA Today which is the Washington Post ... every single thing and it\nWas a lie about health care [laughter] yeah I don't understand how the\nUSA Today justifies running an ad that is entirely made up\nI mean everything and I was on true and I don't understand if you're a journalistic organization I don't care if it's the president of the world if you're a journalistic organization you have a responsibility to do basic fact checking and you can't just run an op ed like that I mean it was all baloney and and somebody who's worked in health care for a really long time\nIt's it's an embarrassment to USA Today I think the editor and explaining to do as to why they're willing to put that in into their newspaper\nAn embarrassment to a paper that has different colors for different sects why yeah I mean a thing as basic as they are that that was the basic yep bucket alive yep\nAnd I didn't know the president of the world was a thing but if it is yeah you should be that in mind now it's too much responsibility I got so I got so cyclists [laughter] me too that are in the world that

off back in Nineteen\nFifty where Woodrow Wilson becomes the first us presidents who attend the world series game this weekend Nineteen fifty the Cleveland Browns played Pittsburgh for the first time and beat the Steelers thirty Seventeen why\nThis weekend Nineteen fifty six Don Larsen of the New York Yankees pitches a person no hitter in the history of the world series even better it was a perfect game\nTo this day no other pitcher has had a no hitter in the world series this week in Nineteen fifty seven the Brooklyn Dodgers announcer moved to Los Angeles Los Angeles agreed to build the team a new stadium something the Brooklyn wouldn't agree to the Dodgers played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles memorial coliseum\nBefore opening Dodger Stadium on April tenth Nineteen sixty two and this week in Nineteen eighty nine\nHerschel walkers traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Minnesota Vikings for five players and six draft pick this is regarded as the best trade in NFL history\nWell for the cowboys Walker had no success and Minnesota while the cowboys build their team up with players like Emmett Smith\nRussell Marilyn Kevin Smith and Darren Woodson at your heart radio weakens gorge time capsule\nDid you see every I director Chris Wray said Wednesday the bureau's background destination into Brett Kavanaugh was limited in scope a really good at it so that when they started a camel Harris did you see her she needs that she's a bad ... you know what I'm saying yeah she pardon my angry nah I see I think I said we all see to all our time\nYet [noise] cable you were a delight foreign ...\nYes I follow her data entry shots of espresso well she can tell it to someone else I get an average this weekend gonna have to sell your Bolden\nWalking now this is a long yeah go\nGet a call not right now see it tomorrow in the seventies show\n[noise]\nAims Thirteen fifty ... is available everywhere he wants to listen on our free I honestly\nThink Lloyd Mayer soundly scandal I'm Mike Moen letting lived here\nFor sunny Florida morning ships white and the terrible destruction caused by hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach Florida where Scott belt will rode out the storm\nThey spend four hours a day asking people for money\nRobert ah Michael shoals and wrote a great piece about this for the Daily Beast you know the some time ago I think it was a few years ago a few years ago\nOr the median net worth is nine hundred thousand dollars in about a third of them are lawyers\nNow that it doesn't even begin to resemble the American public the American populace\nSo what if we simply put the name\nBut the names of registered voters but of all Americans over the age of say twenty five\nInto a a into a computer\nThat had a random you know they had the ability to do a genuine random thing\nAnd I pulled out four hundred and thirty five people and said okay here's your here's your legislators\nYou know as your random sample gets larger you tend to get closer and closer to a sample that actually mirrors the population\nIt's it's called the law large numbers\nBy the way this is how ancient\nDid it\nThe policy was six thousand people\nDrawn by at they actually had a a machine that ah that\nGot the number and you know got the names out in a way they couldn't be corrupted which is kinda cool\nSo if we did this number one you'd have a legislature that was fifty fifty men and women\nNumber two they be low at less wealthy less educated and fewer white people\nNumber three the members would not be beholden to any special interests\nAnd only a few of them would be lawyers oh and you'd have a lot more young people\nIs sort of ... and\nA system you know basically you know picking our legislators the same way we pick our juries\nIs that an idea we should consider\nIt it it's a you know it's it's kind of interesting as it's almost it's almost kind of cool but you know on the one hand on the other hand really I think you could build a strong case that the biggest problem that we have with our political system right now\nIs is money you know the big cancer and our political system is is money from the coast and and these other billionaires and and they have just corrupted our political process\nI mean ... is this totally crazy I mean this is you know keep it on the Athenians democracy is what we patterned our democracy after it's wide juries are the way they are\nAnd this is how they did it this is how the ancient Greeks to either you know I don't know I I think it might\nBe something you don't be fascinating to see a state tried those but you know this would require legislators to say you know we're going to give up our own power which is\nPretty unlikely self any I wanted to share that with you the Supreme Court are we now know or what is happening on the Supreme Court as a consequence of Brett Kavanaugh being out there there is\nA had Merrick Garland been on the court ah everybody all you know all the observers of this are are pretty sure this ruling would not have happened\nBut a Tuesday of this week the first day of the first session of the Supreme Court the Brett Kavanaugh was on the court\nStruck down\nA lower court ruling that had struck down a Republican law in North Dakota that made it nearly impossible for tens of thousands of Native Americans to vote in North Dakota\nIn North Dakota because of the way mail delivery is handled and because of the way you know it's it's a it's sovereign land versus versus a private land and and you know is a part of the United states is a sovereign nation all this kind of stuff for the for those reasons principally\nAnd because there's so much poverty but you know mostly actually it has to do with it being a reservation most people who live on the reservation in North Dakota any way don't have a street address they have a post office box\nAnd you know we're talking about\nSeventy thousand North Dakota ins\nTwenty percent of the turnout in a presidential election\nTwenty percent of the voters\nHave a post office box is their address\nSo the Republicans passed a law saying that if you want to vote\nYou must have ID\nThat has a a an actual physical address on it and not a post office box\nIt was just a very straightforward way of knocking Seventy thousand Native Americans off the voting rolls\nAnd a lower court said you know this is racist\nCrap all I mean you can't do this\nAnd the Supreme Court in a split decision again had Merrick Garland been on the court he would have struck this doubt I mean we we know this from his his record on the DC circuit\nBut Brett Kavanaugh was like oh this is cool\nAnd so we're the one vote majority they ... they uh they blocked the lower court order that was blocking this law and they put this Republican law into effect so we are now we have seen now the first bit\nOf Brett Kavanaugh doing his thing and it's obscene\nIs in my opinion this is just absolutely obscene\nWe have this massive a hurricane hurricane Michael that just hit the Gulf Coast it's now heading up through the Carolinas and Georgia and all that stuff are heading up toward a D.C in the New York and\nIn the past one of the things a lot of us don't think about other people out of the prisoners in the past now prisons are probably not you know they're they're not built like trailer parks they're not going to blow away uh although apparently at least one prison has lost part of it's rough\nBut the power goes down\nNear yeah they've got emergency generators cause prisons are so electrified you know all the the the gates locks and things so but and they they plan for hurricanes obviously 'cause this is hurricane country\nBut you know it's still not a good thing or a good time and there was an effort in fact there was a phone banking ever yesterday to a or a couple of days ago to to get them to um to move the prisoners which they didn't do we've been looking uh looking around\nAnd he was looking around this morning for any reports of any injuries or anything like that we haven't found any but if you know of anything that has to do with this issue\nMe yesterday at some links you know I actually am a pick this up on the other side of the break I yesterday\nThere was this op ed [noise]\nThat was published in the name of Donald Trump apparently it was just a White House press release\nThat an editor USA Today so

Michael ... man his website Michael\nMan with two ends M. A. N. N. dot net a doctor man welcome back to the program\nSo the BCC in response to a to a query this wasn't their normal five your report this was in response to an inquiry from the from some of these island nations that are\nAre looking at the possibility of extinction essentially you know vanishing are under the waters I ask them you know is this is this a you know goal of keeping temperatures below uh what were the two degrees was the original to Celsius\nEven lower target here right of what rights fired up\nRight so they said you know what the consequences be if we if we lower the goal and this whole new bunch of research in the last couple of years came out and it's got a head exploding tell us what to summarize it for us was\nSure well there are a lot of reasons to believe that uh two degrees Celsius warming of the planet as a whole lot worse than one and a half degrees Celsius\nWhich is a whole lot worse than the one degree Celsius we've already warmed and the uh the issue here really has to do for example with how close are we to the collapse of substantial parts of the um the the major ice sheets the west Antarctic ice sheet the Greenland ice sheet um if those\nIce sheets continue to lose ice as they have been doing\nThat it may be in the too late for many of these low lying island nations the amount of sea level rise that will see\nOver the next several decades will literally submerged somebody's island so they have reason to be worried about\nAny additional warming and whereas two degrees Celsius warming is the target that has largely been adopted I'm uh in in these discussions are for defining dangerous interference with the climate pretty low lying island nations you know one and a half degrees Celsius is catastrophic\nFor many of the regions that are suffering a unprecedented drought and heat waves and wild fires we've already warmed a dangerous amount and so it's really a question of how far down this dangerous highway are we willing to go\nYeah [laughter] and and uh [noise] and how far are we willing to go apparently\nWell in the absence of any you know a mitigation in it you know if we pursue business as usual burning of fossil fuels in one of the planet by four to five Celsius that's seven and nine Fahrenheit by the end of the century\nThen we will see a truly devastating climate change it ... the the summer the devastating summer of twenty Eighteen with wildfires and floods and this super storms we've seen this fall most recently my namesake Michael\nDevastating burn the the strongest storm ever to a landfall uh the U.S coastline this late in the season\nUm you know that's that we will that will be partially the course and we'll see see far more devastating um extreme weather events hurricanes massive sea level rise and flooding\nUm that's a world that we certainly don't want to live and we don't want our children and grandchildren to live in um if we\nYou know curtail are burning a fossil fuels dramatically in the years ahead we can still avoid warming the planet more than two degrees Celsius and we certainly don't want to warm it any more than that uh the Paris Agreement I'm basically\nGet the half way from that four to five Celsius seven and nine Fahrenheit warming are down to the two degrees Celsius warming that pretty much everybody agrees we want to keep warming below a the Paris Agreement commitments get us about halfway there that means we still have work to do\nWell this this this report is essentially calling for a massive reduction within the next ten to twelve years I'm ... can you can you give us the the the specifics that they're calling for in terms of productions and\nYou know as having an established that it'll be a disaster if we don't do this I mean we've got several Republicans who have come out and said uh literally have made fun of it I mean you know the the three members to Republican members of Congress in the last twenty four hours of one of them made the comment ah you know it would take all the money in the world to do this which is a B. S.\nUm you know another made a similar comment um\nWhat what specifically are they saying we have to do and we have to start doing right now\nYeah of course than it is a disingenuous talking point to say it will cut it cost us dearly to act because the reality as it would cost us dearly tend not to\nGet on it already is I mean look at hurricane market\nWell absolutely and and the devastating extreme weather events a wild fires and drought floods that we've seen summer I'm already the the cost of inaction is so much greater than the cost of actually taking action and so that is a disingenuous talking points in in its predictable the forces of denial or out in force trying to distract\nThe public and policymakers in the in the wake of this devastating new PC say report and here's the irony Tom\nI'm this report is overly conservative as the BCC reports over a always are and in terms of the budget of carbon how much carbon\nDo we have left that we can burn and still avoid

to\nSay what a day what a what an enormous amount of stuff going on Tony in Huntsville, Alabama hey Tony what's on your mind\nHi Tom how you doing I'm well I was trying to catch the beginning of your rent which I hate missing it because I Love the show and I always catch the beginning of your rent\nI'm not really sure what the definition of it ...\nIt it's basically it's how juries work is you know sitting juries are work by ... it's you take a large pool of of citizens the largest possible pool and you randomly select people from it and you get a representative slice of the larger population\nOkay let me ask you this fish may be a little off topic but I'm I think you kinda fits in\nLet's say\nYou had a budget felons or inmates were guys like me who don't have representation but pay taxes ... and they wanted to get a carton and they volunteered themselves to the city local municipal governments\n... as a way to get a parking and get their voting rights back would you say that that would be about the same as a public official ...\nEyes somebody just working volunteering don't give us some reduced rate show where basically paying back because remember it's X Y Z versus the people for\nShow we're paying the people back by representing the people and an addict addict or do I get up and somebody staffer\nYou're ... you're in Alabama you're in Huntsville, Alabama Alabama and one of a few states it's a minority of states it's bits in principle the old south\nWhere if you committed a felony and you have served your time you've veer off parole or probation you're now you know back in society as a full member of society and most of the states the United states you are right to vote is restored\nIn Alabama in Florida in a few other southern states that right has gone for the rest of your life\nThat is wrong in my opinion so you know how I rather than trying to figure out a way for ex ex felons to work their way back to ... voting rights and being fully you know full members of society we need to change those laws\nAnd so I Would say you know rather than than you know arguing should we should we allow felons to their acts fell on the you know use voluntary service as a way of earning their citizenship I Would say they already earned their citizenship the back by serving their time\nAbsolutely and working for absolutely free in the prison system weed out everything from the administrative work to run to the kitchen is running out of the captains runner which me not at all of these major paperwork and you don't reaping all the filing except for his signature and it was the only thing I didn't have the power to do\nBut when you have that kind of experience\nThey take it all from you when you get out because you can't get a job but the whole point is we have no representation at all\nAnd we're tens of thousands of people\nYou're right you're right and then about\nYeah you're absolutely right and and and the further south to go on them in America the higher those those numbers get\nTony thanks for the call I you know this is something we all we all need to commit ourselves to and ah you know to to ending fell into disenfranchisement I haven't in Grand Rapids Michigan mostly on a Ninety five point three of them one of our Pacifica affiliates there hey I've and what's up\nHigh I'm I was just wondering what you thought of a whether the profit motive of capitalism which survive global warming or not\nWell as the motives of capitalism is that is causing global warming and unfortunate but that's\nWhat I was thinking and do we need to start talking about alternatives as to capitalism right now because it doesn't seem to be working\nYeah I think that that that conversation as one we've been having for a long long time and the uh well I certainly we've been having a big way since the Eighteen sixties when Carl Marx published dust copy tall or ...\nAh and then mark singles you know the communist manifesto a few years later that does\nThat and that conversation kind of went sideways with the Soviet Union and and a mile a who took the idea of communism this this really neat idea of everybody kind of you know it was ... idea right I mean you know his his Mary band every I had the common person Judas was the one who is in charge of the common first that's communism\nAnd and uh and turn it into a national thing but it didn't work and I I think that the communism works really really well in small communities where everybody knows each other\nBecause it does require a certain kind of honor system peace to it but when it's possible for people to be anonymous communism starts to break down\nNow the question of capitalism is can capitalism be used to to undo or to to undo the damage of capitalism I mean that was the whole idea\nOf cap and trade and cap and trade actually successfully work to stop sulfur dioxide emissions and it was George Herbert Walker Bush has got that legislation passed a cap and trade of sulfur dioxide and you know we couldn't do that\nBecause you cap and trade I in fact several European nations already done this with carbon dioxide [noise] um I think a carbon tax that much more straightforward way to do it [noise] but I don't I don't think capitalism going away any days as soon as much as I Would like to\n[noise] you're listening to Tom [noise]\nThink about the amount of time you spend every day in your office chair for most of us it's over two thousand hours in here so if you're spending all that time in the wrong chair is it any wonder you're having back problems

the storms damage was catastrophic\nThis one went very quickly but er it's tremendous destruction the areas where to as the past that it it shows as a incredible the kinds of destruction we've not seen destruction like that in a long time\nAnd for the last four months raising a million and a half dollars which was our kickoff amount to hire and executive director we want to have a staff on the outside to work with the progressive caucus members and the progressive groups around the country to really connect all those great ideas and all the energy and the progressive movement\nWith progressive and Congress where we can actually actualize the change so we're going to have a couple of policy people a couple of outreach people working with the national progressive groups communications staff\nAnd executive director development director fulltime fellows going and some of the key members offices because if we take the majority we have Thirteen members of our clock is poised to be committee chairs and thirty poised to be subcommittee chairs which means we're in a position to govern in many ways\nA lot of hand uh we're also trying to diversify the staff we've got a whole bunch of goals but the good news is this has become a reality ah this is kind of taking the old democratic steady group that existed\nPre Newt Gingrich he got rid of it I'm giving it a a redo for twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen and we're going to be ready to hit the ground running in January with is that we can actually actualize\nProgressive policy change so we're really proud to announce it from ... from Seattle and I have been leading the effort and uh we're we're very excited about the possibility that it's going to have\nThat spectacular is there any call for action to ah you know average citizens motors uh you know are are you reached out to the public for fundraising or is this just a hay heads up\nI I think it's a heads up because at this point we literally are hiring the executive director we wanted to show how serious we were by having pre funding for a year in the bank before we even put the position out\nSo we're hiring up right now hopefully being in place by January we will do grassroots fundraising down the road at this point it's been from foundations a unions and some individuals who've written some very fairly decent size checks\nAre but we're going to be opening it up a probably in the next several months as we get the staff hired but uh we're just very excited to let people know that the progressives are ready to hit the ground running in January a so it should be a good session\nThat his spectacular so let's pick up some phone calls here are Emily in Bullhead city Arizona you're on the air with Congress and mark Pocan Emily\nHigh a I had an interesting take on this a article that came out in the u._s._a. today [noise] and to me\nThey put it out the same time that the early voting started to catch all these people going to vote or his owning\nA ticket to get them to just vote ... straight Republican that makes sense congressman here yeah\nYeah I mean I Am so we have rolling voting dates in a few states but you're right that there was a math that kind of hit right now\nI think this is a a bigger strategy for them that they're they're desperate when you look at the campaigns they're running through Paul Ryan superPAC almost none of them are on the issues they're not talking really about healthcare they're not talking about good paying jobs are infrastructure they're not talking about\nThe culture of corruption in Washington they talk about personal attacks in going after people's families and the rest they may have had when they were Eighteen or Twenty years old and I think you know this is something where they're they're trying to get into the policy arena\nTo put something to scare people but unfortunately people are already scared that they're going to lose their health care and that's why Seventy percent of the people supporting a Medicare for all concept so I think they're way behind this is kind of\nTrying to to give them some ability to talk about health care in\nA very obviously manipulated way since fifty two percent of Republicans also supported Medicare for all and that Reuters poll they know they're in trouble a and they're trying to put out deceit and lies but I don't think they're going to succeed and I think we just have to be\nWilling to stand up and explain this and then show that the American people really support this issue but uh there's no question a lot of what they've done timing lies with ads in general especially these really nasty negative ads\nHave been in in coinciding with early voting\nTo bend in South orange New Jersey or on the earth congressman mark Pocan\nCongressmen I was just wondering what your thoughts were about ... becoming the next speaker of the house should the Democrats take over\nHis so Barbara Lee is not running for speaker Beverly is running for caucus chair of the way our structure is um we have a a few spots at the kind of the head of the clock is as far as um if we get the majority ...\nYou're talking to the Democratic caucus not the ...\nRight yeah no democratic caucus as a whole correct so that when we were driving in ours\nYeah system majority leader a whip position and then we have a caucus chair and assistant caucus chair I'm Barbara Lee ran two years ago for cock his chair lost by a\nCouple of votes as it goes for votes and she's running for that again as caucus chair right now we also have some other progressive caucus members who are very active running a including David Sicily from Rhode Island running for assistant majority leader and Katherine Clark from Massachusetts is running for assistant\nCock his chair so a Barbara Lee is definitely running for one of the leadership spots as are some other progressive or we're excited to get more progressive into leadership uh but she's not running for speaker and I don't think she has any intention to even if it would open up I think you know she's really very focused on being our caucus chair organizing\nOkay congressman mark is with

Ross in hickory hills Illinois you're on the earth Carson okay\nHi yes let's talk to you Tom and Mr broke and I was watching the stock market defy called you they have the c._e._o. I'm there between bom bah maturity\nAnd these tax cuts within five years we are going to be over a trillion dollars dot com not budgets and their own course Donald Trump's blaming the fed said they raise them right and Obama for not paying bills when you guys get the house are you guys ready to tackle this debt because I'll tell you what\nThis is they say inflation is rising and we're going to be in a recession if we don't get a hold of this what do you guys say about that you\nKnow this is so often what happens Democrats get in and we fix the mess that's been created by the Republicans the problem is this time they really created a mess with that tax bill nearly two trillion dollars of additional debt in days after they passed it Paul Ryan said um\nWe're gonna have to do something the debts increase where you have to go after entitlements which is what they mean when they say Social Security and Medicare so you know uh we need to be there just to make sure that someone doesn't do it in the very wrong way\nBut we have to go back after those big tax cuts for the wealthy and we have to make sure that we're protecting the programs that people actually a plan on in in count on that you've paid into your entire life like Social Security and Medicare so I I think you'll see Democrats very active on this but boy you know it always seems like we clean up the mess\nThat the Republicans crate while they're and government yet their rhetoric doesn't match their actions\nYou know the Democrats are going to clean up the mess rather than doing it like Clinton did by cutting welfare right I Would much rather see rolling back the rain all the way back to the Reagan tax cuts that America was working really really well before Reagan but you know Reagan's tax cuts and uh I think there's any chance lesser\nWhat we offer a lot of those ideas in our annual progressive caucus budget the people's budget or we have a new classification for people who are even higher income levels as well as going back to some of the previous rates so you know we're hopefully going to be as we will be advocating for that uh as things move forward I think you know for us time the big question is do we have the Senate\nAh 'cause we don't we're not going to have the White House and uh you know how what's the majority and the house a lot of that is going to determine how aggressive we can be a we're certainly going to talk about it but the reality is where the votes will be will depend on where the Senate's at and how big of a margin and having a house\nThere you go ... to Texas you're on the earth ... okay\nHi guys hey Rick uh well we need to change the messaging on the way Medicare is explain to everybody right now Medicaid is what I'm On the handicap and really really poor people and Medicare is for elderly people retired people\nWhat we're not getting out is the fact that ... what we will have will be for everybody from the very first born to people on their desk that you will cover everybody there will be no more out of pocket if done right\nYou will be covered and we're missing the point fingers are getting the crap scared album that oh God my Medicare will be gone no we want it will be enhanced it will be much better ... Canada has gone we've got to work on the ... and I ...\nI think one thing when we say Medicare for all we say the for all part right so we are saying it's for every single person so to exactly to your point that's why we're trying to keep it simple and talking about it in that way but also I think you know Donald Trump just put this out there that somehow you're going to lose your Medicare\nGame

camera and he was one ... one of those taking your calls for the hour\nIs the co chair of the congressional ... outside God and a gym in merit island Florida year on the air with congressman poking\nI understood it hum my big\nDeal is or not getting the information on what actually Medicare for all of your parents systems are I think we need to focus more on the individual cost Republicans and conservatives talk about this program\nThere they condense a public editor free free free all we want to freeze out\nOr not actually educating them that it's a program that everybody will pay just oh it's free will be three fifty a month or a hundred miles five thousand a year whatever the cost will be well not getting out across that\nI think the biggest drawback on I'm getting that after\n... gym so a couple of things one first by I respectfully disagree just a little bit that I think many people do understand what we're talking about with Medicare for all which is why\nAgain fifty two percent of Republicans and overall Seventy percent of people or support in a poll that was just taken four or five weeks ago by writers so I I I think that you know while they're trying to put misinformation out there and now a lot of people already fundamentally understand the current system isn't working for everyone it certainly didn't work\nWhen when you had a pre existing condition and you couldn't get healthcare I think once we get to the next session should we take the majority and we actually are positioned to pass the bill\nWhich were not able to do right now under Paul Ryan and the Republican majority oh you're going to have an educational process and what have conversations with people and you'll see that activity really increased um and hopefully then we can increase the support even beyond what it's at right now but\nI you know there there are clearly pushing back because they're nervous about this a lot of their money special interests don't want to go down this direction and it's gonna affect their profits\nA but this is one where the people are just tired of having fights over health care they just want to make sure that their loved ones are covered when they're sick and they don't have to lose insurance because they have a pre existing condition\nRobin Bainbridge Island Washington listening KFC are you're on the air with congressman poke him\nYeah you're on the era\nGreat thanks to both of you for the great work you're doing a regarding forming a larger audience or have a question really for both of you but especially for Mark I'm\nSure you do a good job of detecting a conservative reactionary trolling are usually very obvious\nUh who portions that doesn't always work as with the Russians to bomb the last election cycle and\nI worked in the area of developing algorithms for various purposes\nIs the government actively tempting to develop all your the rich can be tacked\n\nIllegitimate include not just in our elections are just efforts to change policy at all different levels\nPolitical trolling basically\nYeah yeah I mean when it comes to elections there's a lot that the federal government's not doing right now that it shouldn't be doing now we've got plenty of warnings we know two years ago that direct influence that happened we know from bringing\nFacebook and other social media platforms to Congress how it can be misused and why we need to do more to make sure there's not that undue influence from outside characters are trying to influence our elections and yet you've seen nothing come out of the Trump Administration using nothing that comes out of the Republicans in Congress to address this\nSo I think there's much more that needs to happen um let's hope in the coming weeks that we don't have the same problems in twenty sixteen because we have been more cognizant and to many in many ways those platforms have been more cognizant of watching and in policing themselves\nBut there's a whole lot from voting machine security to online social media to uh other advertising options that we\nHave to be more vigilant about hopefully something we can do if we take the majority\nWe have a minute and a half to the end of

in the sea there Rick Nolan is stepping down to an open seat\nA it's a seat that Trump won and there's a ton of money from Paul Ryan superPAC that is funded largely by shell the NATO said here's what they're using and I think it's effective\nThere is one donor from Minnesota to that pack that gave two hundred and fifty dollars and they're spending millions against this guy so this isn't about voters and Minnesota are ever someone lives this is about really rich people like Sheldon Adelson trying to get even richer and the Republicans are more than glad to do that for him and I think you're right the more we expose that the more they'll understand\nThose are just lies and not about a local value [noise] cocker ... thanks so much for being with us today\nOf course think he'd time as

critical supplies correspondent Brian to us\nAre created by a teacher\nI'm Wondering why would be feasible workable plan to get the foundation all the other big money out of our government that she got shut down the entire government could they do that or is\nYeah some other way no there isn't\nThere is a way to do it uh it you know number one I ... I like what the last caller said to congressman poke in what congressman folk instead backed him which is that here in Oregon when Jeff Merkley was being attacked by the Koch brothers front groups he can't he ran ads with you know\nIt just calling them out he made the Koch brothers a campaign issue I think that the Democrats should absolutely be doing this nationwide right now in every single race and I don't know why they're afraid to do it on they need to get out there and they need to turn the coke and make the Koch brothers radioactive but not just the Koch brothers ate all send them home you know the whole crowd\nA number one but number two how do we get money out of politics money was inserted into politics in Nineteen Seventy six and a big way remember back in Nineteen oh seven during the Teddy Roosevelt administration they passed the Tillman act which said that it's a felony for a corporation to give money to any candidate for federal office\nUm fast forward in Nineteen Seventy six that get struck down by a a decision called ... versus ... a and and then ah another one two years later a first national bank versus ... there was actually authored by Lewis Powell that decision\nAnd Dan in both cases the first Buckley having to do with billionaires\nA first national bank having to do with corporations in both cases what the Supreme Court ruled was that money is a protected by the first amendment as if it were free speech\nBecause corporations don't have a mouth and 'cause billionaires are just individual people they can't talk so loud that millions of people can hear them so their money can work as their speech I take that as a total nonsense a total BS um argument but it is a law the land out because the Supreme Court said so\nSo what we need to do is change the composition of the Supreme Court if\n... if a if the Supreme Court had not had the the uh the presidency of George W. Bush in two thousand we would right now I have a seven to two liberal advantage on the Supreme Court and said we've got a five to four conservative advantage so what we need to do if we get control and this is your ear scenario Terry and by the way thank you for calling um the what we need to do is\nIs pass either a simple majority of Congress can pass legislation that changes the number of members of the Supreme Court\nSo once we've got the ... the White House the Senate and the house I realize it's going to be a while though I might be twenty twenty twenty and might be another two years might be even six years who knows but one we've got those three things\nPassed that law take the Supreme Court from nine to eleven or nine to Thirteen\nHave that Democratic president put for new two or four new justices on the court and have in the meantime started Janine up a case that was like the Buckley case that the Supreme Court can use to reverse Buckley in reverse Citizens United in her first first national bank versus bloody and reverse McCutcheon and just reverse the whole damn thing\nAnd that will get us back to the way we were from Seventeen eighty nine when the constitution was ratified until Nineteen Seventy six and when when five justices on the Supreme Court blew everything up and turned us from a democracy into an oligarchy\nRoy in Greensboro North Carolina\nTo um uh JFK hero take what's up\nOf severe the climate crisis oh by the way of adjusting Rosario remarks were right um they are just white trash they should on it for a bunch of crybaby so\nBut I'm I'm really concerned about the climate crisis and I don't think the western wildfires are being recognized as a huge factor in this year's weather disruptions here Piedmont North Carolina every day\nTen to Fifteen degrees above average misery heat index even higher it's like a hundred degrees everyday into October\nWell this is this is why hurricane Michael went so far so fast it's because of the Gulf waters are averaging eighty three degrees right now for and hide\nAnd ethically in October this October Fifteen at this time of year uh they're Seventy Seventy one Seventy three degrees so there are ten degrees warmer than normal that's when jak hurricane Michael I shouldn't have surprised anybody forget my interruption right keep on going\nNo quite us right on our uh Chesapeake Bay I went there this summer in August\nThey're losing a lot of the salinity the crabs oysters are somewhat disappearing because of all the rain we've had in the rain you all have an ad out west there um and I think it's because of these fires are putting the heat\nArticulates carbon into the atmosphere\nAnd I have a I have an idea to fight it I Would really be interested in your opinion\nYou know are gargantuan military ...\nLast year uh all the funding went\nTo fighting wildfires and there was no prevention this past winter Trump should have seen that Congress should have seen uh [noise] I say we just a rotating\nAre gargantuan military one company or inspired by the time for prevention this year\nClearing the dead on their brush may be\nClear and the trees planting new trees that are more\nSuitable or something or you know something\nReally well Franklin Roosevelt confined to the same problem really we had the dust bowl and what's going on and literally the tops of the Midwest was being blown into the east coast out to the Atlantic\nAnd and uh what he did is he created this thing called the civilian conservation corps the C C C and he hired a couple of literally a couple of million American out of work men and and bend built camps all over the all over the country for them to work from ... and live in\nAnd they planted millions of trees a month\nAnd as they re forested ... a lot of it was just along roadsides hedge rose things like that property borders\nUm but what it did was it broke up the wins and and I and stabilize the soil and helped capture moisture in a way that stopped the dust bowl FDR ended the dust bowl and this is one of the stories of the FDR knows ration that almost nobody knows\nFDR ended the dust bowl apply those with the C C C with a giant and government program that was really just designed to put people back to work but it ended the dust bowl\nSo yeah it could be done and it doesn't need to be the military can be done the same way that the Roosevelt did that said though one of the big and and and I'm Glad you said replacing the trees with species that are more appropriate 'cause one of the big problems that they have in California and pretty much everywhere else right now is that trees can't move\nUnder attack domestically so we definitely I thank you Emily thank you so much and thank you for serving your country in the
