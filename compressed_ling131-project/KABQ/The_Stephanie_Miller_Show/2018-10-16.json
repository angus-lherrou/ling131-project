I Believe ... who's higher among going\nOkay that's not something that you've been able to get around to yet\nHow long we've been on the ball\nWell you know whenever you start is when you start with saving for retirement what do you have available to you like are you working somewhere that they offer a four one K. or equivalent retirement plan\nThat plan do they offer any employer match\nI Would have to look for those cook I'm sure they're\nOK so that is where you get started\nAs you throw yourself into that employer plan and if you if you haven't ever say before I hate to ask a lady this kind of give me an approximate age there that you are\nI'm I'm In my\nFifties All right so it means that\nIf you can afford to you're going to need to save a a really significant amount of your salary and the four one K. but you can't start there because it would be a shock to your wallet if you went from not saving for retirement all of a sudden saving a huge amount\nUh-huh so I'd like for you to to do this in a modified series a baby steps reading I Would start\nBy putting it on your employer plan up to what you need to do pick up the employer match\nAnd in many places the work that would mean you're gonna have to start saving six percent of your pay\nAnd then pick up the employer match and that six percent it's going to be a shock from zero normally I talked about stepping up what you're saving every six months in your case I Would go to the six percent\nAnd wait a year and then one year from when you start causing money into the retirement plan at work go to seven percent\nOf all and then every six months after that go up another ... percent oh before you know it in your case in like two years' time you'll be saving a dime of every dollar you may plus picking up all the employer match\nOh well thank you\nOh mommy I got one other thing to tell you okay when they hand you\nThat retirement plan get at your place of work or they tell you where to go look on the line there's going to be a confusing array of choices to invest in an\nPeople just shut down and don't go any further because it just is so confusing so do the easiest thing of all and that's picked the target retirement fund choice in the plan\nWhere you pick a year closest to when you're thinking you're going to retire and all the money you contribute plus the employer contribute should go right into that [noise]\nAnd if you get into the process and you get confused Patricia\nPlease call me back and we'll walk it through and talk it through [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show

leadership and the oval office now we have just complete lack of morality of any kind yeah right\nRight okay oh okay yes ah Chris Van Hollen let's talk about uh he's talking about Trump or in Saudi Arabia\nWhich shameful that the president of the United states would allow himself to be used as the mouth piece or for the Saudi regimes cover a story here\n[noise] um yeah that that ... a Christian home went on to say\nAnd for the president United States to participate in what clearly is pay Saudi effort it cover up in white washed or is is really um undermining the credibility United States has so many ways\n... here's the thing like we said this every week right did not conspiratorial it's just you get to the point you would not put anything past oh yeah mhm this president or this administration and its like David Frum is that how far does this go I mean\nI Wonder if that were involved in this I mean he was banned in Saudi Arabia for criticizing Trump the mortar yeah ... anti obviously increasingly criticized the king\nAnd you just go we obviously had the intelligence that we could have warned him at least yeah the only thing worse than that I mean it's and here's Trump actively lying for them when his his thing is oh he's not a citizen will ah shouldn't matter they even bother to get their lives straight right he went was wrote killers yesterday right and okay Chris Van Hollen again\nTalking about a CIA\nCIA said with respect to the and again this was in the public reporting\nWith respect to the ... the killing that there is no way the crown prince would not know whether the king new I don't know but there is no way that the crown prince who was taking the reins of day to day our government is Saudi Arabia or was not either hatching this plot certainly aware of this ...\nYes he is Travis is just handed me another Trump telling them directly opposed by things that are on videotape this one for the record\nInterest in Saudi Arabia or Russia for that matter any suggestion that I have is just more\nFake news which there isn't any well I mean he's still just feeding Lester Holt interview so I mean\nHe's on tape saying how much money he gets from Saudi Arabia and how that how much how many of his uh places yeah condos vi yeah yeah it doesn't matter and some ... interestingly if we saw his what's the word I'm looking for sure yeah\nRight okay we've

lesser stalls are I I heard somebody who has been unwilling to sit down with Bob Mueller or who has continued to obstruct and I think tamper with witnesses in the way that is kind of dangles pardons out there in the weather has talked about the investigation wildfires have deliberative\nHow she can wind this thing up by just sitting down with Bob Mueller it's clear about what he wants to see if\nThat was a scary thing to me and Leslie stall interviews he was repeatedly obviously pressed on whether he was going to mhm shut down the ... and it's a\nLegitimate ... do you believe in you know the ...\nI mean any kind of does he works for us yeah exactly a small one more we do\nIt's clear that whether it was his NBC or interview with western ... you know essentially admitted to why he fired
