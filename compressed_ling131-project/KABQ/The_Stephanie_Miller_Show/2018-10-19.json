lessons and I haven't gotten that over the years she and other foreign made and the last year and the other Clinton my high school teaching job and how to run this business so kind\nOf really you are such an accomplished individual at making people into great swimmers that you're able to give up your what had been your career just to concentrate on that\nYes and I love that it's such a great rewarding service provider painful and now that I can only work preventing drowning person at a time\nOh so you're special emphasis is on preschoolers\nAll of it we have from they all went out for help take care and if I Try apple lines down to four month old babies that are taking lessons with us satellites run to the phones and water and a lot of other things to that\nQuestion Roger relations you Jennifer because then that is the kind of story I Love you said you haven't invented anything yes you have we been wanting you invented a successful business out of thin air that you're providing a service and you're making money doing it\nWell here's my question I have a ten year old daughter and you know just like my swimming lots of kind of started because as a parent I found there were no lessons around in our area\nAnd so I found I found that need in our community anger on business out of that and that was the same planet in the long and the guy when it gets gradually were the kind of fall on his side of our time\nThat when my ten year old daughter and son the struggles that I see myself and their parents going through\nWith this new age they're in there and\nI now have to like ... on my heart and new cash and wanting to try to help parents and I don't want to get too much into that and that and I tell them is is it's not so much that I might need capital help right now I hear you talk about like angel investors and things like that and I've watched the TV shows that you can go on to try to get\nInvestments in your mishaps idea which has an editor usually car and gadgets and that you're trying to sell not a service that I'm thinking of\nBut now it's more like an online type of thing that we tie in with Facebook and Instagram and having a different things that our children are so involved in these days that I'll never that I don't have that technical now now it's like I just had this great idea and I had an ounce around to different people that have all said\nOh you could start a nonprofit with that and make a website and even you know the national campaigns like the light lost her kid and then ah\nYou know the real power of an idea like that is to do it as a business not as a non profit\nBecause that's where the opportunity allies is that it can ah more and feed on itself over time is you help parents who are worried that their kids or may not be paying enough attention their kids are ending up in harm's way\nBecause what parents get busy in their lives get will be sitting there with a tablet or a laptop\nOr even a smartphone and a parent

just taken the sleep\nWith your swimming business and it seems to me you're energies really need to be devoted to focusing on growing that business\nWhere I Am too I I'm a workaholic I Love to work on

nations has agreed to help\nMeanwhile the caravan is working its way into President Trump's campaign talk\nThe president's hit on a new mid term election themed believing that his desire to stop migrants tried to get into the United states is a hit with voters throwing the Supreme Court nominee battle and Mr Trump tells a Montana rally\nI Know a lot of cabinet all the caravan law and order

we are talking about this yesterday or the day before we are out just standing in technical intelligence yeah I mean let me tell you if we didn't\nHave a copy of that than we certainly had a description of it from first to your sources yeah a ... well before it got into the media were that good but Mike Pompeo Donald Trump they've got this little game going on there you know or and they are providing cover for the Saudi Government\nAnd now once Pompeo came back and reported this stuff is real\nYou know all the reporting you've been seeing from the CIA ... for the last two weeks it's real only than Donald Trump says okay well we'll see if we can do with it you know what's gonna happen nothing they are going to allow them to investigate\n... deep disappointment knock them oh no what did it was at a company with thoughts and prayers but yeah yeah yeah and it's great yeah they've cut off or intelligence right he they they canceled a meeting to share intelligence of the Senate of course because he said it's not a pretty picture you know Saudi Arabia\nStephanie ... this little this deliberate piece of performance art keeps unraveling because sources keep undermining the position was reporting yesterday they paint late for him they played for him right when he was out there the actual audio of the murder and the torture taking place of the show\nYeah yes knock him I Know you've got stronger stomach having been\nIn the intelligence business but ah yeah this is horrifying I mean it's just the more details that come out I mean not only about\n... you know being tortured with the you know defected basically while he was alive for seven minutes then beheaded ... you know the detail yesterday was that he was sedated at a certain point so that he could still be conscious drought but not scream\nI'm sure that they should uh you know I ran the terrorism hostage survival school yeah uh for four years of this uh dated him and the first moments just to get them complying but aware\nAnd ah then at that point they wanted him to suffer it and they ended it most likely ended it with a ritual is the ceremonial beheading which is what they do but none of this is not sanctioned by the crown\nPrince it cannot happen all of those aircraft that flew there were from the royal flight yeah okay that's like the air force one stable all the people who were there were the equivalent of his immediate Secret Service detail you know they had the guy um\nYou know that one guy is the key ... he's the Saudi Keith Schiller to Saudi\nKeith show are only more importantly he would be the equivalent of the supervisor of the oval office security and uh and special forces pilots and then this guy was a famous\nFamous forensic pathologist in Saudi Arabia who is known for his for processing the dead who were killed at mecca\nDuring stampede Z and and you know in in incidents where people die by the hundreds sometimes during the ...\nAnd this guy created a mobile forensics laboratory a multi million dollar mobile forensics laboratory in mecca there's documentaries showing this ban yeah discuss how he has bought forensic science back there he's on the plane with these special forces and oil guard guys\nAnd he's in the room with bones saw yeah\nAs you do when you go to a a interrogation\nI'm Scott working our friends waited Trump is complicit in assassination think about that he's helping the Saudis cover up the assassination of a U.S resident resident ... he's known 'cause you know he was dead since the story broke lied to the world about Trump is the biggest threat to our national security um because someone else wrote that Malcolm is like\nWhat is this open the door to now what next because they ... obviously the world knows you can a buy off Donald Trump that he has you know no moral core of any kind\nOf I've been saying that for for a long time that the Saudis when he went to his trip to Saudi Arabia uh up until this point us presidents were immune\nImmune to their charms over there\nAnd they're ... the way that they do business is they offer you cut they offer you a deal or they offer you a straight up Dr I had that happened to me or Iraq\nYeah it was standard practice you got ten percent kicked back to you on any deal and when I didn't do that in Iraq people were dumbfounded they couldn't understand me yeah you know because I'm an American\nDonald Trump is a player he came into that casino ready to take whatever kickbacks they offered ready to take whatever sweetheart deals facilitate Asian of of Jared Kushner's a debt all

All right I'm All right so uh for non you were saying\nAbout uh uh uh what do you call it that we were talking about smaller well first of all your take on Rosen steam and the comments he made because we're all nervous right you know ... yeah basically with defending the investigation but you're like is he fired right after the you know the midterms in ... what was your take on all that\nWell look I mean I think the fact that Rosenstein still has a job is a is a tremendous thing for this country I'm shocked that he's still there yeah I thought they were going to use the um the leak if you will of the time stories the pretext to get rid of him\nFundamentally I think Trump knows what's going on you saw Don McGahn out also the general gas today yesterday was his last day on the gig yeah after we learned hundreds of ours was the term\nOf cooperation Manafort was reported a couple of days ago yeah he's had dozens of hours with the special counsel's office something is clearly rumbling something is clearly cooking and as I said earlier I think those indictments or an ice and the question is how quickly Stephanie after the election\nDo does the report come out and does it start to leak into the into the mainstream yeah because\nIf I got nervous than than two months even if there's a huge blue wave like that a couple of month period before we actually take power right\nOh yeah we missed you can happen in that period of time but I suspect Fernandez right I think there there's one piece of this puzzle which we we all spoken and written about several times in this room\nBut what I call the bridge has not yet been completely uh done a five and that's the bridge between wiki leaks and the Trump campaign which is essentially the Russians and the Trump chemical\nThat is that why that's where men if they're talking to Manafort about is his connection to stone in about\n... can I just I just know more and you know ... you know it's a joke over in Mohler scheme that every morning they pick up the phone and they go get me Roger Stone they have all the break out at the laughter is like yeah they're going to get that guy is going to be fun [laughter]\nCooking some active

Malcolm has learned in the work he's done overseas\nWhat these governments that are trying to flip a system you're more than anything is a popular peaceful uprising national mobilization\nAnd that's why we're talking in only asking you were not asking you to put the uniform on and go put your life on the line where blue where an American flag and just be out there shows that there is safety in numbers and there are millions tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of us Stephanie that don't want this to happen and if you if\nYou have a history yeah and if you don't have enough to motivate you the fat that pollutant is right now openly taunting us than America's done America American influence is over\nI show him exactly what Malcolm says in his book this is what putting his

Eighteen days I think it's a team a little bit less in Eighteen days for the most important election in our history\nAnd inspired by my friend over here ... we're simply calling for people to recognize that Donald Trump is on the ballot yes on one side but so it was American democracy\nAnd if American democracy doesn't win it may not come back and\nMalcolm you know people always say well are you guys over the top are you guys just trying to scare people into action and I say is the son of Cuban exiles people who came from a place that literally lost their country\nI don't want this to happen to my country our beloved country which is why we're calling on everybody to march for democracy Seventy two hours before the election where blue\nPeaceful national mobilization of physical presence and wave your American flag and make sure you do everything in your power to get everybody to the polls\nI Love it oh you have to do is we're blue you know you don't want to march just where ... go to Wal Mart\nRight and and and show your patriotism we're going to have it's a color revolution you're calling for yeah and if they see it here's the beautiful part and psychological warfare if the right wing sort of have\nAnyone who wears blue by default is in the more that's right right you are in the national protests but if everyone starts wearing blue in the media starts figuring out that there is something going on while you're doing voter registration you're wearing blue\nThe visual represent the Blu ray him don't we want to mention of a blue wave excellent losing on there you go\nThat we can we can envision it um we were just talking Malcolm left our ...\nIs really extraordinary not just the amount of corruption but the amount of lying we just never seen anything like this all of that I ever if I Eric Trump's on TV like I mean their their entire business model is been lying to investors um\nThis was the story someone was talking about Saudi crown prince bragged that Jared Kushner gave him CIA intelligence about other Saudi saying here are your enemies days before the corruption clack crap down which led to torture in death\nSo this ... thing didn't come out of nowhere you know the other thing is we're finding out he's talking to the what is what's his name Mr Bones saw NBS it'd be a ... probably what's happening right first of all he sets up a back channel to the Russians now he's talking so and there was Hillary Clinton's private email server he's talking to Saudi prince\nTrying to figure out this cover up on on WhatsApp\nYou could do and what ... is giving Jerry pushing the recommendations like you might want this person has a friend Vladimir poop you might want Kim Jong ...\nFirst you have any friends that are Russian or Saudi Arabian\nOr

emphasize that she said why do they lie all the time all they do is what I did not know what they're doing\nThe answer's yes this is a play out of the autocrats play book is called post truth yeah they want to keep everybody in the state of suspended confusion the gas lighting of America this is all by design and they will pick moments where they will actually tell the truth and then like consecutively for another eighty instances in a row\nThis is by design this is why we're pleading with everybody who came here is not understand this is not a joke\nThis is not again this is a deliberate takeover a post coup environment that we're living in and the question is are we the people the last line of defense willing to take our country back 'cause it's right now gone\nYeah when

yeah they've done this in Europe\nYeah [noise] oh okay so but you had tweeted early on bigger story U.S intelligence has special flash communications reporting network designed to inform the president of critical intelligence within five minutes of recognition\nOr a Trump has been lying to us about because she'll be since day one and he still is usually from memory yesterday oh well I don't know that it looks maybe\nUsually five minutes a maximum of ten minutes from the moment of recognition yeah show on the day that ... a disappeared in that embassy that would not have been that level of reporting but the moment\nThat the Turks came out and said that he was killed or we would have used our own intelligence in that flash traffic would have gone straight to the president was out stop yeah it it must be put before the president and brief that was the first day it's been two weeks now yeah\nHe really much has been like\nThe way I've been pointing out just about the Saudi arms deal on top of it is not a hundred and ten billion dollar deal right now it stands at fourteen point five billion\nA while he is personally ... millions of dollars in Saudi business where am I reading from um he's exaggerated by seven hundred percent the value of us weapons sale to Saudi Arabia and he\nSaid a hundred and ten billion with the military the biggest ordering these three of the world like\nEverything's what he has to lie about everything and everything in reality only fourteen point five million a weapon sales have been approved by the Trump Administration\nOr in a ... this is a case where conflicts of interest can kill said Walter shop the autocrats in the world are watching what the United States doesn't ask next to nothing happens what's next in American citizen gets murder broad dissidents in exile get killed on American soil\nYes and that happened a lot under Moammar Gadhafi he would send out hit teams to murder his dissidents overseas and I think the Saudis just thought hey we can do that now\nDonald Trump is not going to do anything Donald Trump themselves set this the other day\nI Believe he's the Saudis citizen\nNo I Believe he's a permanent us resident bumped Virginia yeah who works in washing Washington Post reporter yeah we used to build an American citizens by the way we dispatch we dispatch cheer one special operations people to rescue people of that status for a moment will allow him to be murdered\nYeah when they first asked me because I don't believe as us citizens like it doesn't matter that is a guy just got killed with the bones offers I okay I just did okay I can act Max Boot ... former lifelong Republican and of course I'm Talking about this\nIt's going to be a long wait if they're looking for a serious investigation I mean asking the Saudis to investigate to market shoulders burger\nIs kind of like asking Donald Trump junior to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign on the Russians the only way you're going to get a fair and impartial investigation as to how it'd be drawn from the outside I mean the Saudis are not going to implicate their crown prince who's in charge of the entire state\nWhich by the way he went on to say that someone after\nI got to look for somebody to take the fall and it's very disturbing when the Washington Post is reporting that the Trump Administration seems to be colluding with the Saudis and trying to come up with a cover story for this murder instead of trying to go to the truth\nSo that's the latest theory right knock them is that they're going to try to pin this on I forget his name but there's name is colonel\nIn the major general McClellan sorry\nAll right and so they're going to say that he could have border he's high up enough he could have ordered this without the print knowing ...\nYeah he's deputy he's deputy commander of Saudi intelligence uh he was the person who reportedly had proposed the uh the away teams that tiger teams which we're supposed to track down dissidents against the regime particularly ...\nThat according to the Washington Post which reported U.S intelligence found that information out and none of that could have been done without the crown prince is personal authorization again they were using aircraft from the royal flight that is like the air force one last week when you said a lot of that stuff\nThat you tweeted about a picture of this guy you said he's the Saudi keeps Schiller reason or the camera images show him at you know\nWe have to cram prints I mean almost got to find out I think\nMy that's my ... and she is the guy who goes around with him he appears to be the supervisor of the crown prince is personal security detail yeah he stands in the uh\nThe advantage images at the in Turkey is what I'm saying\nWell yeah and yeah I don't know where he's the leader of this this is ... yeah um which tells you it's personal\nWe talked about this whole family I mean how disgusting this reporting on Jared Kushner urging the president stick by the Saudi prince whose is bud and he said a cushion or argue that the outrage over a show these disappearance unless they keep calling it a

there's lots on every issue now on Saudi Arabia we were talking about as well but\nThis this whole ... it just shows you the story but at some point in twenty sixteen the FBI received this unverified Russian intelligence describing before to the emails from Loretta Lynch to a member of the Clinton team in which she promised she go easy on Clinton\nOf course it was they knew it was junk was fake that you know she would write no such thing but so I'm just reading this book never never let's call me has reportedly told aids he uh he uh\nHe would let that disinformation shape his decision to sideline rent Lynch fearing in part the conservatives will create if you're if the alleged emails became public uh and so that's why he\nWithin her guy that was ...\nLike lots of destroyed democracy yet we have an entire section that's called meta narrative framing right where they push you to a decision they have made for you yeah\nOne analyst said it was a Russian forgery ... major decisions in the Justice Department on Russian disinformation because of the optics of it\nThe Russians targeted the FBI hoping they'd act on it and then he went ahead and did it so even this thing eleven days
