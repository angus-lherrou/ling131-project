call it extreme say something that's really high on our list of priorities are we recently we carry a mortgage on it or we put a hundred thousand down to carry a mortgage or one thirty seven\nBoth of our cars are paid off my wife faith so four one K. and we both have rough IRA she funds for a little more regularly than\nI Do but we've got about two hundred thousand dollars city and I guess we pay off their mortgage or put that money on the market I guess I'm well off\nYou know since you are an extreme savory you're already doing all the things you are you have all that cash setting live your life debt free\nPay it off you know usually when I get questions from people bill about\nYou know accelerating paying off a mortgage they're trying to get it done\nIt's making a choice not to invest or not to use retirement accounts or whatever and the only the only goal was paying off the mortgage and that is false economics in your case you're doing all that stuff and you still have a mountain of excess cash\nPay off that mortgage I don't even care if the interest rate is low I guess\nThat was our concern because we're just ride around three percent interest and that's almost like free money\nAnd I love that except the money you have sitting idle you're earning less than one percent on it they're earning hero got it\nYeah so you're paying a multi point spread so the answer to you is different than when I'd normally given this case because you're already doing so many things on the positive side of the ledger and then the beauty is what's your mortgage per month that's about twelve hundred dollars\nSo that's twelve hundred dollars every month you can make sure you from this point forward you're fully funding Iraq your dollar cost averaging into it so you're not worried

I blame the press for some of this too rudely but but somebody talking just mentioned some Republican du da da da da da and it's like wait a minute make sure you the APA obviously took away their endorsement yeah I mean\nYeah they they they wanted more a a real investigation and and then and then on things like perjury they're going to do their own investigation and if it turns out that they believe perjure themselves or you don't need a quarter law it's there for getting writing or they're breaking a credential yeah\nI mean where do you agree speaking of I might movement thank you good guys you are one of them and it it's\nI mean is just astounding that you know ... ... it's hard to really sort of put into words have disgusting what Susan Collins didn't she didn't she could have just said I'm voting\nYes right but she became like the females face for the Republican Party of basically calling Dr Ford a liar I mean you can't you can't say she's credible but she's just a little east confused about who it was right\nWell actually it's rotating she's voted for it\nSupreme Court I'm that he's been a senator she's voted for every single one now that's about all I mean she voted for\nKagan instead of my or but she had no problems voting for a leader or or suture Robert right so you know the idea that she that at any point she was going to go against that it was ludicrous\nBeing that speech showed that thing that speech showed was she knew all along what she was going to vote and was just ... she was just a tension horn for the whole time\nYeah I mean that the whole thing it's uncorroborated when they know full well that the ... the FBI did not talk to forty witnesses who would have caught corroborated right I mean it it it's just\nAnd by the way you wrote a piece false accusations of rape usually end up being proven false I mean this is just such a ... ... ... what is the number anywhere from two percent to six percent or something\nYou know we usually on federal route five but that five percent okay that five percent number is misleading because that five percent it includes ... includes a you know sometimes when there's a there's more than one witness than you know we're not being can be\n... you know there there's all kinds of reasons why but that that number is ... ... the real number is actually very low\nYeah well that's that's what I'm saying it's like you know for them to put out this ... name that it's like some sort of you know rational this this happens all the time and and as you were saying that pathetic little skit he did about you know you know the mother the sun telling her you know his mother that she's wrongly accused it's like yeah\nYeah yeah and the other thing that they leave out in in discussing this is that is that almost all of those cases that they're investigated by the police or with a full investigation and they prove yeah you know what the guy didn't do it\nAnd so and it was a false accusations and if it's been liberally false accusation what happened and we we lived I Lived cases just from the last few months women are arrested and sometimes put in jail for making a false accusation\nRight you said the fact that most ... of the false cases are proven false it's a pretty big incentive for someone who's falsely accused want is full investigation as possible and that set everything we needed to know right is that she's the one on the investigation and he obviously didn't\nYeah and I loved by the way I loved by the way that this you know I Believe I Believe ... something happens that Christie and Bob the board but it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's like yeah I don't believe her you don't believe or ... or you're thinking oh certainly drunk woman you couldn't possibly you know I have no really almost ...

know full well the Dianne Feinstein didn't leak the name by the way right ... you know and that's why the was the right wing government was was you know trying to do opposition\nResearch on it before it was even really I don't think\nShe said she told other people she told friends yeah so the letter didn't have to leak it was she said she told beach friends\nYeah I'm sure Lindsey Graham will call for investigation to the moon doggy or [noise] they should be afraid of an investigation of this [noise]\nFifty eight minutes after the our air bowler next Stephanie Miller show\nWrote a ... a big piece of the um what a wonderful we Trump pet and now you know he's flying high [laughter] yeah yeah that the times doesn't think it was a game changer I'm not sure other people will either\nYeah I mean exactly this is the world we're in right we're we're someone on during the investigation for conspiring right there you know to the hospital power ... to be elected has basically put another illegitimate\nA judge on the Supreme Court I'm Sorry it's just this everybody knows this FBI investigation was a sham and but it's but you're right it's all about oh is that an ... that's when right that's\nThe way it and and and you know a guarantee you a bronco bottom or a was under was badly under criminal indictment had nominated someone who needed an emergency FBI sham investigation in order to cram him through to get forty eight no votes\nYou think do you think the D.C press would have spent the weekend\nToasting Obama and his amazing when of course not\nYeah the the the the the narrative would have been this is the White House in chaos in disarray or they don't know what they're doing but you know we all saw the the the coverage over the weekend this was an amazing win for the White House\nHe's so savvy you know Republicans out smarter Democrats again and and just a quick boy I mean on friday literally the narrative was\nIf Democrats defeat Kavanaugh it's going to be a huge win for the Republican Party\nBecause it's going to energize their base yep Sunday the media narrative was Kevin Irwin therefore it's a huge win for Trump in the White House 'cause it energize the Republican thank you I mean it yeah it's it's ... for Democrats as usual it says you lose tells you lose\nRight and I'm sick of the the ... we just have to get out and vote we just have to I honestly let us doubled down I you know ... ... registering herself registering other people checking our registration all of that because you're right you just the ... will drive you insane I mean I ... and you're absolutely how could it be both things\nYeah and and and and again you know Trump was\nTweeting over the weekend I mean he's he's describing Democrats as this mob you know it was arson is with the with the lighting a torch I mean he's basically inciting violence\nAgain wait let's let's listen to that 'cause I I was I was gonna say yeah I can take\nA look you don't hand matches doing arson is\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they become [noise]\nWow so as you say\nHow how do you listen to that how do you listen to that extraordinary moment in American politics\nWhere the president United States is describing the opposition party\nAs a as a arson this mob and hear those words of approval and how if you're a D.C pundit do then type up a story about what an amazing winning streak Trump is on I mean it's it's just mind boggling and that's what's so dangerous about this\nUh and and you know the authoritarians I mean us Malcolm Nance your friend up here for ... two top goals corrupt the top court in any country and try to de legitimize the press and Trump is going full force on both of those\nAnd we get columns about how savvy and smart he is and boy he's on a winning streak I mean it's it's very dangerous\nYeah I I mean and ... and ... how did he give me this one again this is this is the second one is angry mom thing\nIn their quest for power\nHave turned into an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from\nPeople are less that weren't you know what those people they couldn't sit\nIn the front row before we have here\nI mean Eric ... it really is it's become angry mind meeting people who don't think attempted rape is perjury belong on the Supreme Court for life right who who really believe women\nAnd and that was the other thing that annoyed me about you know this D.C commentary about how Trump won and now Democrats screwed this up and Democrats energize the base what exactly does the press things Democrats should have done right not investigated\nTo see if the Supreme Court nominee was possibly guilty of sexual assault I mean it was Republicans who demanded this what turned out to be an FBI sham investigation which extended this all for a week what were what exactly did Democrats do that they shouldn't have done\nRight yeah and I know when Lindsey Graham says oh I didn't do this to sell them are are Kagan yeah well guess what they didn't have allegations of sexual assault against them I mean we didn't do it to ... I guess my because they didn't have allegations of sexual assault against them they didn't perjure themselves I mean to try to save forty witnesses\nAnd three accusers our democratic plot right\nRight and and and and and again that that's what was so annoying a friday Thursday and friday would've became crystal clear that the FBI investigation was a sham how do you not interview have it on for it I mean clearly\nA board if Kavanaugh was forced to answer questions from FBI agents\nYou know if he told the truth he wasn't going to be a Supreme Court justice if he lied he open himself up to legal jeopardy so obviously from day one the White House made the decision that was no way they could risk having Ford\nBeat a like a cat and are being interviewed by by the agents where we've got so that\nThat right there the whole thing is is a sham in every reporter who's solve the the you know the results of the report knew it was a sham but instead of staying so they have to like go to Democrats oh do you think it's a shame yes it's a shame and then the reports\nAre well the two parties are split on this FDR report yeah I Know they they just won't stay at for themselves but they just won't say what's in front of the\nWell I mean by the way where was that story over the weekend that Don McGahn told the president if he did it a real FBI investigation like Trump initially I guess was asking for he said he said it will be disastrous near Canada yeah of course\nYeah okay so uh Houston Kavanaugh you also tweeting Kavanaugh will be the first justice nominated by someone who lost the popular vote confirmed by senators representing less than half the country well posed by a majority of the country um\nYeah there's so much that we ... ... when we get the levers of power back I was just reading I mean kennel Harris represents forty million people now and she has the same power as Susan Collins who represents one point someone in a million yeah\nYeah I mean it's amazing you know and people are talking about what to do about the Supreme Court\nAh and whether you start stacking it and things like that I mean ... ... people forget that on the eve of are the two thousand sixteen election when I look you know when everyone including the entire Republican Party thought Hillary was going to win a ... several\nRepublican senators came out weeks before\nAnd they said we will never confirm\nAny Supreme Court justice that Hillary Clinton nominates a a you know because of her emails or would have him but I mean we're in the position that you know if Democrats um you know if a Democrat wins the White House in twenty twenty and Republicans still clinging to the Senate um I don't see how a Democratic president would ever get\nUm um you know a nominee on the

I Believe\nI feel like the evidence I that's just my feeling that it already is and and I feel like when\nWhen Democrats get subpoena power were able to do real investigations there's no way you're going to be able to say caffeine you believe in the rule of law and you can allow him to stay on the Supreme Court for life this is not just like oh well this is only generations of\n... things will affect all of us forever right you can't go on air and live in front of the country and break the rules that you have promise to uphold yeah job interview I'm going to steal the car and now I Want to have a car salesman\nYeah I just don't watch any\nI Know I mean again it's been said over and over but you know in any woman at a job interview going I'm here as a wife and a mother and crying and screaming and bright\nIt's what I said he was like a chick trying to get out of a speeding ticket no black men are white women or woman period yeah no one but a white male right every white male could have gotten away with it it was a Shia these as ... which led her saying like oh I Believe Dr for but then the angry white man's scared me so I changed my mind here she is\nAfter hearing Christine Ford is very compelling and painful testimony I thought oh my goodness ah\nJust needs to withdraw and but then when he came back with such a forceful denial and the anger and and English that he showed yeah a ... and then the lack of cooperation and\n[noise] she feels a little turned on I'm going to say oh he's angry that I heard ... angry I just I have to then just totally changed by\nUm yeah my principles just disappeared because I [noise] [laughter]\nWait a minute and then she knows\nThey keep saying there's no cooperation ... when we know how many witnesses were ready to cooperate and that she had the that they would not let the FBI speak too I mean it's it's the\nI mean you've got the your books have backup all this stuff too by the way yeah\nYeah the books that are older she's part of the devil's triangle now yeah I think probably haven't ... harass off as we speak\nSo what I had it America [noise] or my back up\nWith your contribution is here [noise] and uh whatever they she's producing the next hour some whatever's happening I I don't know anything about it but [noise] parent leaves all the stuff you know show [noise]\n\nLittle research director on ... blocks north of Kendall area or makes attracted\nAnd my mother didn't want to believe me um but that sat me down with the other male adult party who immediately started crying and had had to admit it and then\nUm I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister\nAnd I didn't know that until it was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying to when you hear these things or successive it's not just one victim it's many it's the the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue my continues escalates they find new victims that when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ... or a\nJewish wedding knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believe you but didn't yet believe that it was at a ... that it was\nYes the other members of my family look me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was given what um\nIf it was false spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white substance on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was you know as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that stuns me for the rest of my life\nAnd when I told my other family members they said well I Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want to be that he had her son that you're telling me because they can't handle that\nWell that's what this was so agree just people reacted so much to this Catherine that was just another layer of of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her satellite so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the U.S\nOf course not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for\nThe Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him and his face is what five inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah he knows right at you and she knows all the obviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean\nThe fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was ever nominated I mean it's just I yeah I yeah I ... I couldn't watch her whole speeches like aka she ditches apparently there's a lot of women who've\nBeen raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that that is the dividing line all the men are innocent of that and\nIn this part that she believes him about really he's port perjured himself how many times but she believes him about roe v Wade\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn presidents are all the time\nThey aren't overturned all the time or there and listen to the standards that he put forward getting his conversation with me and also a ... in the here and he says for president along established precedent like road to be overturned\nIt would have to have been gravy a slave Ron and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in a sort of the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not ... but obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed into Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but um\nIt's an upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\n\nYou're losing ...\nWe're\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard of ... go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere is something that you're right about whether to Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway or the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just this rate the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kind of like again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh I thought you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr Ford did don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women\nYou know you need to be responsible for their own blah blah blah well\nIt's something I tweeted recently it's Ninety two to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other time\nThere is no suddenly they're all lying and that's what they want you to believe so that means is\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women right who are obviously credible and have a cooperating witness was they've been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report the thing that the truth\nOf it is that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said that that the white women are our first or a barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and white man's first degree of saying he's lying if not him\nThat whole discuss things get Trump did you know about the\nMother or grandmother mother I'd been unfairly mom mom what am I going to do like you know just before again as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash\nOf of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's a yeah okay so ah Kellyanne Conway\nOh there are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we can get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again not going to defend her speech justice Kavanaugh justice Cavanaugh I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes roe versus Wade is a federal law\nPlease write he wouldn't be on this list you know if if he was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just it's [noise]\nYou know what kills me is you don't like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get abortions for their mistresses you know and it it it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses speak of is not going to end I think what people have to recognize as\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves that I said the system is working exactly as it was designed by white right conservative med it worked perfectly they got Kavanaugh he will control women's bodies he will control whether Trump is brought down or not he will do exactly what they wanted the system worked for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nThis is what the the rhetoric the always uses ... stuff like this coming on Conway said\nTo be pro choice and two thousand Eighteen that your first sex selection abortion they offer late term abortion taxpayer funded abortions\nAfter ... ... ... they they can feel that is the issue here do wish that way the way I Will be ... what I keep [noise]\nJudge now I can you know very nicely if they just discovered or read right it was a very unfair situation do I even the playing field at once they did that started this tale through it was very very unfairly didn't\n[noise] level the playing field [noise] end zone dance like the clip on yeah I mean just [noise]\nThe way they talk about it just makes it even worse that when it pretty soon we're going to have to take selfies in the middle of our attempted rape excuse me I just have to yeah loading up second we need some ... here but this year but I don't mind yeah exactly Mike in Chicago real quick hello Mike\nHead on my good on ... ten seconds\nI Am working for a drone Scarborough\nWould have to talk of so [noise] and the movie theater constantly saying that this has around ... not ...\nWell

other fantastic activists Jennifer ... Addison a president ... executive director of the center for popular democracy she was there right at the Supreme Court ah protesting right our eye witness firsthand experience yeah\nI'm In God Bless all those women um and I love we can talk to a gym and just a second year but she said we were saying look us in the eyes actually have a conversation with us and that's what was so powerful about that uh that alligator tape adjust lake and they don't look at the ground look at me you know I mean that that's\nThat's like this whole conversation stop averting your eyes from this it doesn't make it a go away or Jennifer ... Edison joins us now hello Jen\nHello thank you so much for having me can I just say you would actually save my life many times when I was in law school I have to commute from that up and put my walk\nOr from Milwaukee mad at her school all and I would listen to your show in the way that keeps me awake during that drive so I have to say thank you for keeping me alive\nO fart jokes keeping you alive God Bless you [laughter] oh man you on that you posted\nThis on Facebook which I Love you said oh no people who keep babies in cages\nOr could care less when innocent black people are murdered in mock sexual assault survivors don't like our protest tactics I guess we should just smile and say please nicely maybe them they'll decide to overthrow patriarchy in white supremacy\nOr we must stop immediately because it turns out voters and Republican strongholds don't like it when we raise our voices Neal at sporting events tell our stories of survival are generally exist so we must stop doing all this immediately so it was not to offend said Republicans um\nYou're absolutely right I mean have they ever read a book about the history of protest [laughter] yeah in this country\nSometimes I Wonder if they have and then I thought through remember that these are all in ... toxic to drawn by uh\nIn in theory there is evidence that a\nDemocrat doing the same thing as saying we're going to go after our base those who believe that a true democracy though to the the power and you know a truth right they all pay racial society we're going to go after those boat\nFor some reason there are a number of Democrats who think our past the power is going to find people who have never vote for Democrats before or who only tried at one time instead of that can that faith and energizing them that we know that actually went back to our country\nThis must have infuriated you are even more than me listening to Mitch McConnell said this to take\nA look I mean they have been after all was short and been under assault and everybody decided to stand up to the mall you know did on\nBeing terminated bothers people I'm just couldn't be prouder among members for refusing to roll over under all English and cone show pressure always loved\n[noise] um so this is they didn't they didn't call the people in Charlottesville a mob be angry Nazis with torches put women trying to speak their truth and trying to be heard I mean you probably saw the tape of a Orrin Hatch like literally with his hand like chewing women away and saying you know grow up\nI mean ... it's hard to imagine that making it worse but somehow they have on every level have and they\nI mean like I was there ... you know George Wallace all looked it up for protesters and history has to be completely on the wrong side and it will do it but he but Connell and these cowardice Republicans as well but let's be clear that they are fundamentally lying these women are not assaulting down and use that lake weighed\nAbout survivors of sexual assault is gun gossiping\nYeah they're they're ... they're rich white men to control all three branches of government but somehow there the the uh the aggrieved party here they're the victims\nAnd we you know this is what we want to encourage people to do I know the country was ... when they saw on a Maria odd and Maria Gallagher in that\nElevator talking that that's like but what folks understand is that there were hundreds of other women would take it that exact same type of accent\nMaybe not in an elevator baby in a stairwell in a hallway at an airport\nAt a coffee shop in front of people's houses they make their voice heart you know we made thousands of call people showed up at least ... miles to try to have a meeting with their senator and they would not eat with us they would not answer call they were giving their constituents to run around\nAnd that was a tactic in that they just life because it worth it to ... they put this we turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from being in an airport in winning it in a bathroom\n... probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assault that he thought well this ban or any other mad accountable for it so you know that's why they didn't like it that's why they crowded and credit because you know they tried it could be public servants and then they didn't like what the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their act\nI mean ... ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just have a human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean it's just yeah I I I mean we were talking about this clip did you see this clip Laura Ingraham in the southern ... back on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a selfie to celebrate you know getting the current attempted\nJust on the on the Supreme Court and he falls on his house she just completely doesn't acknowledge it does\nBut I mean it's just that it's like they don't have the missing some sort of human ship or something right I didn't even pause to say are you OK role that was one of your you know that was a human moment that didn't go how we ...
