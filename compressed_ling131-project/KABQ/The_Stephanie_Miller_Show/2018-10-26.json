[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWow out good morning of a man\nTo morning how are you oh don't mind me yeah I'm just ...\nYes I ah I wow he really does so he tweeted that three this morning bashing uh CNN um the word is that he apparently very annoyed that he's being blamed for the for the bombs\nSo he just tweeted Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans go out and vote\nWow oh wow and we've had our what twelve this morning Cory Booker and James Clapper being the last two correct\nThere were up to bomb number twelve and my assessment is is that uh they'll target these individual than we have between Fifteen and twenty bumps probably inside the pipeline a you know some prominent Democrats not yet received any there's a rumor that\nAh you know maybe there's one out there and Dianne Feinstein we haven't seen\nA Nancy Pelosi we haven't seen Rick Warren we haven't seen some of the others and I'd like to call attention there's a group there's a political action committee called shoot you're forty five dogs\nThat is running a commercial that I've been wondering about\nThat portrays progressives and Democrats in any you know Republicans who are opposed to Trump as dangerous violent gangs and these ads are\nEverywhere everywhere I've been in the country I've seen these ads but every person who was a bomb for the most part is in this that\nAnd you know I mean a missile costs yellow a Cortez and and others so these people have a mindset how the terrorists have have a target listed in their head and this individual went doubt it this is a serious serious bombing campaign that we're in right now\nNow come from the amount of bombs that were talking about and what you just said do you feel like um it it is a group or do you feel like it's an individual\nFeels like an individual who had a lot of time on his hands who to created a a bomb fact or a bomb assembly line yeah usually recalled these facilities any improvised explosive device facility a bomb factories\nAnd that's what I've been warning on television the last two days you know let's not get too caught up in the motivations of of this individual uh you know the target set we have to we we can't ignore anymore but the motivations of the individual until we get him until we secured\nThis bomb factory you know this stuff may have been low grade explosives or but he intends these things to kill the individuals who opened them whether it's the mailman or or secretary at the ... got to secure it\nThank you that the press conference yesterday knock him he said the bomb squads have been treating the devices and live on and\nI I heard somebody make that very point that you know what are these poor postal workers that don't have the secret service and don't have protection I mean you're right we've got to catch this guy\nOn these devices will blow up and kill the individual who opens they'll blow the fingers off they'll put shrapnel or to the face in to the chest there's washers in there there's broken glass\nAnd there are these things are designed to kill just because he's an amateur bomber and didn't do it very well doesn't mean that he that one of these won't go off Jim Cavanaugh ATF agent who's who's on TV with me all the time he says there viable Jim Cavanaugh tells me there viable there viable yeah\nI'm James Clapper said this morning he sees a clear pattern in the in the bomb threat to anyone who is in publicly from me to be an extra learn um but that's you know again you been a counterterrorism expert for how long and this is the point of terror is you know and it it is in Texas

my ... my name is Lou Dobbs would say [noise]\nHis desk and Michelle singles in Watergate attorney to one day going to come up on the Stephanie Miller shown\n[noise]\nTo demand in connection with suspected explosive center critics of President Trump there are few details right now but this comes after two more packages with potentially dangerous devices were found\nHe's trying to assert misconduct right on behalf of the governor he said I Believe there was tremendous misconduct on the governments have regarding my case um how's that going to go for\nIt to this is all Republican praying mid term election ploy there are so many lies and let's call them what they are out there now about policy like\nThe Republicans are going to protect preexisting conditions the Democrats are not going to\nThat's insane I mean all you have to do is look at how they vote and what policies there for you know a suggesting to know that that is not true and the same thing is true here they're trying to make Muller again look bad and the Republicans are saying that\nIt's all a big hoax yeah and that it needs to be investigated and that\nThe investigation of Papadopoulos is a violation of his Fourth Amendment is right to um not be subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure when we know that he said to an Australian diplomat in London\nI Know that the Russians have these emails that's pretty good proof that he knew before anyone else knew and he told it to a totally\nUnbiased person an Australian diplomat who had no reason to say anything other than the truth and so that there was a good reason for the FBI to investigate him based on how did he know this\nAnd why did he know this and who mold ... so it seems to keep that his his involvement with the Russians it's pretty clear\nAnd there's nothing more to it than that and this is just something that will be said so that the base of the Republican Party will accept that these fraudulent statements are true well believe it and move voting according to that a thing wait a minute yeah\nAnd his team are threatening democracy they are risking national ... already and saying it's false things I'm yeah I Hope they will see\nThe truth of eventually\n... ... a Newt Gingrich on cue heard just said um if you know Democrats win and they tried to subpoena\nHis tax returns he said it'll go to the Supreme Court and then we'll find out if the Kavanaugh flight was worth it exactly which is well first of all they're like admitting that they're putting him in to protect Trump right\nThat anybody who doubted that I'm surprised because it was pretty apparent I'm even before he said that I'm just surprised that he's not smart enough not\nTo set it out loud yeah so it's clearly true\nYeah well so what do you think is happening with smaller I mean I I guess there's some unwritten rule about not as close to the midterms but boy oh boy with everything happening and you don't you feel like while the American people really have all of a right to know as soon as possible I\nDo and it's it's sort of scary I mean an investigation has a life of its own and you have to let it go until it's done yeah and it's it there is a time I mean let's face it comb\nWe did the wrong thing by interfering in the election by making an announcement first of all it was the wrong announcement he had to retract and he could have avoided the seconds announcement by\nEnough FBI agents on it as soon as he learned about it ...\nThis is going back to the extra emails that he doesn't you know said oh wait there may be and then you know like a week later said oh no there's nothing there they're all the same yeah um and it could have found out the answer before he announced it and said you know there's nothing here\nI I just I'm worried that if something comes out let's say there is an indictment\nA week after the election than most voters are going to hopefully most voters are going to say why didn't I Know that before right a voted and on the other hand if they did something\nThe day before the election or the week before man days before that\nWhoever is involved you know in in the indictments the Republicans are going to say this was putting their\nYou know finger on the scale of justice and influencing the election and this will be in court yeah long thing so there's sort of almost no good time when there is an election that says happily come\nRight on but it's in modeling I feel close to the election here I mean it is mad\nRight I mean it is troubling the whole Kavanaugh thing obviously but I mean the fact that you may have someone on the court does not think a president can be investigated subpoenaed or indicted\nRight I mean I I feel like the I remember you see on TV I think we talked about this last time saying that you know you had the case all ready to go against Nixon and then a Ford pardoned him and I just feel like if Mueller's findings are what we think they are\nHow do you just let that go that's not political dirty tricks like Nixon ... that's treason isn't it\nIt it is I but I wouldn't say that anybody is going to let it go um I think that this will eventually be brought assuming that there is evidence that it will come to trial that it will you know what\nThe president as an uninvited co conspirator or if he wants to the rules and see if a president could be indicted and I do believe the constitution would allow that\nI don't know if it's the right thing to do at this time I think that impeachment would be a better approach or voting out of office we have a better approach but definitely there is something that needs to come out we need to have the facts America isn't titled to the facts for sure\nYeah yeah absolutely I'm Jill I've ah selected them my mom's pin that I'm giving you it is a a a blue wave rock star pin\nOh I'm so honored and such a great family and all this will be an honor to wear\nAll I Am a listen we're going to get pin tomorrow night in Chicago very
