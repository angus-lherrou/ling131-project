and you may not\nMe [noise]\nDavid is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi David how are you who worry thank you David [noise] so I Can't believe you're asking this question 'cause you're the second person recently to ask almost see it in a ... question\nSorry I missed the answer\nFrom the no no it it just shows that it's a topic that people don't know really how to handle and what to do say hit me with it\nSo we're having a family reunion in Italy in Tuscany and we're going to be flying into a room and then ah probably driving to Tuscany and the question I had and we're going to stay there three days in a room and a week in Tuscany um\nAnd I wanted to know what I Need to do about getting insurance I've done some checking I called a couple of my credit card companies one that was platinum that I thought would have everything and they said that Italy was excluded from their coverage but then I called another one\nUm which wasn't even platinum and they said that they provide full coverage for the vehicle um and so they said no I don't need to take any of the optional coverage is they they covered all as long as it were that credit cards\nAnd in fact there's an additional condition that if you do take coverage is from the car rental company you cannot use their coverage is that come from the credit card company so you have to do you have to either go all in or not at all\nAnd basically I should I mean there's no ... it's expensive in Europe for an insurance so I should basically just saved my money\nWell no that depends because the big issue is not the cost of repairing a car the big issue is liability\nSo the call that I'd like you to make his to your own automobile ensure\nAnd see if they cover you for temporary use of a rental car in Europe\nMost Troy ability yeah they well they would actually uh most auto insurance cover you pretty much the same as they would\nFor how your own car is covered or if you were renting a car in the United states they recover you the same way overseas you just got to make sure that you're insured does that okay 'cause he very much for or does that\nThat when I checked with the car companies rental car companies Europe I thought they included liability coverage in the base fees but you don't think that's right\nGenerally that's not true they will ah unless there's a country specific rule and I'm not aware of one in Italy that does that liability is for the harm you cause somebody else and the car rental companies not really interested in protecting you against that\nAnd then the other question a couple of other questions about running the car one was is there a some kind of a website That's better than others for getting our rates and\nWell I booked in Italy a couple of different ways and it seems I rent a car in Italy at least once a year\nAnd I have both used auto Europe in Italy and that book direct with car rental companies\nSo auto Europe is there used to be several of these um car rental booking services for Europe and I don't know what happened in that field but auto Europe is now really the dominant player\nAnd so and then ... go ahead do you think that we should rent a car\nOr in Rome in we're going to be staying down by the trivia gown fountain and don't break down town and then drive to Tuscany or is it better to take a train to Florence and rent a car there\nAnd then how are you getting back to the United states so you're going from a foreign student going back to ... yeah we're\nGoing to leave from Florence and turn the car in Florence\nThat would be much better idea taking the train cars driving in Rome is very very difficult\nWhen we when we were just read the car you know we're on the way out in Rome when we leave\nIf you were going to go back to food Chino Airport or something like that and rent a car that's fine I mean you will have um I ... I think it's how you say the other Rome Airport or from Chino you rent a car at one of them you can go right from them directly onto the Italian version of the interstate system\nThe only thing is watch the speed because the speed cameras seemed to be everywhere okay but that would be fine to rent and Dr ...\nI was really thinking you were telling me you were going to go drive right from central Rome\nNo no we are in fact I don't even think you can rent a car in central room to go there I think you have to go there to get it\nI think you can rent in central Rome but just because you can doesn't mean you should\n[laughter] I Would definitely be a case that you should have a great trip you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n[noise] ESPN Plus your college football\nJust throwing it out there you know what's going on and not punching hard enough on this I mean these these obviously posturing because anyone this would be so easy\nYou know I can take any

third my blue wave T. shirt [noise] if I just don't [noise] and and I didn't have that with Michael a couple of weeks ago and I I I think he's a fighter and he's great attorney and all that but I just I Do not want to talk about it when he twenty\nAnd I think he started a path already and I'm like no\nNo all your all our money all our focus should be on what's happening in three weeks Jamie agrees

this\nIs just even this stuff the horse face monitoring penis and I'm like wow Mitch McConnell just talked about that he's going to cut Social Security Medicare because of their tax cuts for the rich\nAnd there are people campaigning yeah campaigning Republicans about how they're going to protect preexisting conditions how they're going to protect apple access to health care however protect Social Security and Medicare Falwell knowing they are lying and have been given orders\nTo destroy all security and Medicare it's the last part of money they haven't looted\nAnd they said Everytime

how\nDeeply a Donald Trump is is in the pocket of the Saudis knowing how deeply Jared Kushner is in the in the pocket of ah NBS I mean this is\nThis is very obvious I mean we don't have to know too much about Donald Trump at this point to understand what he's doing here he's obvious skating with the same routine he always does with Russia and what do we know about Donald Trump and Russia this is all part of a big set of\nOf of just criminality that he is not revealing there's something\nFurther to the story that that he is not telling us and made it to the\nBottom said that yesterday about um

covering up as criminality covering up these shady deals that he's been covering up all of these sources of cash that he needs now\nBecause he is probably broke and deeply in debt he's got this giant

were launched by an Eighteen year old student who arrived on campus with a rifle and opened fire investigators said all the victims died of gunshot wounds to the majority of the victims are said to be teenagers corresponded Matthew chancellor receiving\nThat that has occurred because we had people confessed to it in their lives to the FBI I'm looking at you George Papadopoulos who keeps trying to reach me on Twitter or write your\nWinter fight with someone different every week with no topless came up out of nowhere and decided he wanted to work all the big dog and you know the funny thing is Mr convicted felon\nCome after someone who is on a retired of decades of service the intelligence community where your convict like talk right right and ah you know use your pen trying to stab me in the bud or something I don't know\nSo that's that's what this guy is he's the fact get from that\nThat will too yeah All right All right so we were talking about are Democrats being fighters a gym Heinz your new congressional spirit and um oh my God [laughter]\nOkay for here is let's try it so much here yes okay\nBut I ... obviously we're talking about Saudi Arabia\nWhat a horrifying thought you know the president of the United states would be manipulated by by by a foreign power where we're have I heard that possibility before um you know what he's doing really though is is is he is he's trading and rivers which is not a helpful thing at this point in time\nYeah and I went on to say\nThe other thing he's doing is sort of gambling with his own credibility he did say you know that would be bad\nIs there would be strong punishment if this happened he said that uh now the question in the world will be watching a is will he follow through because it's looking more and more like in fact the Saudis did this\n[noise] this is why I keep saying is ... ... ... and obviously he's\nDoubling down on the old you know here we go again with the you know guilty until proven innocent\nOr like you know ... and ... and here's where the scandals going to come and we're going to find out from someone in Congress at some point that he was informed with in hours yeah of that murder if not with in the hour of that murder\nThrough the critical communication system that we have in the intelligence community that informs the president in five minutes no more than ten minutes from when a critical national security event has occurred like the murder of the Washington Post columnist yeah I can even imagine the guy riding that up right now we haven't set in the Washington Post modern yup one more\nJim Honda Saudi a regime is trying to figure out how to make this as as least catastrophic as it can be quite frankly it worries me with the president trading and rumors and maybe repeating the trial balloons at the Saudis are running it sort of feels like maybe the uh is trying to help the Saudis put the fight whatever find fish you can put on this\nYeah he really probably get listen forwarded pong guy that worked for me it will try that when it started when or to\nThe word I can tell you how this conversation happening\nBetween Donald Trump and Mohammed bin ...\nIt was like listen we we don't have any of the facts let us take care of it we'll take a look at an average you know we have the finest until we know you weren't involved\n[laughter] just Mitt and he goes into conspiracy with people like him all the time this is now mafia like work and that's what the Robert Mueller reports going to report\nYep guarantee Chicago you're with Malcolm how exciting for you\nGood morning yes I Am very excited so Malcolm I just want to thank you because you act with both a taser and that ... to all of us\n[laughter] I'm writing my head right he's ... he's the human carrot and stick I'm a big key with lasers and it's a [laughter] absolutely\nUm so I I I Want to return the favor sites ... at a warning it'd be very careful Malcolm even very few ... men that had Ben ... men had been able to avoid being put in their box\nOf his excuse me I've been boxed in a lot down here yeah be careful\nAnd looking I'm looking for my blue sound effects currently go ahead

created a quote you put that horrible Sally cone on and we have to turn you off why do you continue to shove these haters down our throats we uh our throats we will do not understand actually says that yes\nAnyway so I thought like wow you know\nIn that tweet somebody beautiful things why is that there's been I mean if you're getting the I'm the one and you know I of course I Love being called people because I like opportunities to talk about not hate in everyone else's hate and how we all do better\nI got someone to turn off Hannity's radio show\nJob nicely done nothing now that that is really deep state of you [laughter] yes\nAnd I I I've always thought of you is the leader of the angry mob before it was cool Sally\nI guess yeah you know I'm like the leader of the righteously angry mobs that would just like in our side to be have\nA you know with more kindness generosity and tolerance than our opponents\nSat in that law yeah I'm not even sure I'm not sure at that point it's really a mom yeah well and we do copy clash I'm leader of a copy clash\nYeah well I mean and we do I'm Sorry I'm I'm so sick of this both sides do it's false equivalence when you know it it is it is not the same now you are on a as I Know\nI I I I actually will he will totally go to count on that because you're right both sides don't do the same but we both do it and we need to knock it off\nOr worse or for\nWill agree to disagree okay because you're on apparently every single panel on political and I'm only on one\n[laughter] you seriously around how many one two three four panels for\nLike they tried to I think they try to get you know they try to you know ... ... they think of a war court\nYeah I don't know yeah you're right yeah yeah\nI I Need to build a wall because you are taking

hawk is on my finger needed ... to ... and others\nUm yeah I mean those are interesting questions I mean I I assume that means sort of post something\nMy I'm discussing my book with Scotty now here which uh I I think will be a really good guy and that was a friend\nA lot has took some issue with why both including ally perpetrator my both so uh you know right into the conversation last year I lost a bet with or you know because\nUh we we bet you started we bet whoever uh uh if if her kid you know Trump won the election um she gave me a makeover and vice\nVersa and unfortunately I'm kind of country and for me Trump won and so she gave me a a a complete Scotty no here the make over and I had to spend the whole day and addressing meals\nUh I've always loved you just the way you are for the for the record you All right thank you very fake news versus the world is the other ... just doesn't seem like kind of the most important thing when you know we have actual journalist getting killed and ah\nThe presidents of the United states covering up for it and and the the fact that we now have\nYou know Sally like two different I\nMean we can't even call them facts on their side they're they're complete lives if your fact checking the president right I mean that that's like the most dangerous thing don't you is that I mean my mom I call her my Ninety five year old Trump voting Republican mom I mean how many times I don't know about you if you had a conversation with someone where you're like\nWell that's just not true mom where did you hear that oh Fox News right\nYeah that's right well I mean I I my conversation with Sean Hannity and the other day just like that\nUm you know it's very interesting I Am looking forward to a conversation about fake news because it it gets honestly it's\nA really tough nut and part of the reason is because in general we've had this blurring between fact and news between reporting an opinion and that one of the waters and you haven't done the work\nTo the market goes down dreams for people part of it is that the term fake news has been weaponized by both sides in in ways that simply give it opposite meeting\nAnd then okay once you push through all of that and at least try to get on anywhere near the same page uh or at least in the same book about problems weren't you can actually do\nUm given both the the the important priorities of free speech and the realities of commercialism\nAnd uh you know that sort of what lean ... you know leave it leans what gets click you know they're paying your cetera right or how you actually address the problem in the media is is it's not easy answer\nRight you have some great advice by tweet you said I Know you're going to vote good for you now do more door knocking and phone

hours a day when I Am not in my mailbox waiting for your blue wave pin which I've ordered for you and thank you\nExcellent they knew that will be fabulous [laughter]\nSo listen obviously you're going to be out here for political on on a lot of news ... or you probably heard this that the there is reporting the mall or is ready to deliver his key findings but not 'til after the midterms of course\nBut this is where it gets tricky right where I've heard you talk about Watergate I'm not clear ... findings will be made public if he doesn't and obtain unsealed indictments the regulations of course he only has to reveal his findings to\nRod Rosenstein who is currently has supervisor right so then the supervisor has discretion over what's given the Congress and what is revealed in public how\nHow do I mean obviously we've heard rumors he's going to fire Rosen's being and sessions after the midterms what are your fears are your thoughts on all this this morning\nWell fares are like everybody else in America um or maybe not everybody because I pay it's only Seventy percent of America who feels the way I Do um but\nThat's enough to have the blue wave 'em I Would say the thing that gives me hope are a couple of things one is that the process that\nWe use during Watergate which was using the grand juries aren't authority to issue a report to Congress is something that Mahler could you do if he is\nBarred from returning an indictment by the rules of the office of legal counsel even though I Do not agree with their legal opinion I think president could be indicted but if he chooses not to for any reason because he believes impeachment of the better process can compile all\nThe evidence that he had into a road map which is what we did and pass it up now the difference is we had a Congress that was actually actively investigating impeachment at the time\nWe knew we weren't wasting our time and that there was a chance that Congress would take the evidence and use it so our hope is that there will be a blue wave and that there will be enough interest in Congress\nThat they will look at that evidence seriously they will issue subpoenas and do their own investigation and\nHave a real search for truth which hasn't happened yet so there is still that that real opportunity and the other thing that gives me hope\nIs Paula Duncan who was the grant that you're in the Manafort case who said I'm a loyal Trump supporter and I think this investigation is a hoax than a witch hunt but the evidence against Manafort is clear and convincing is guilty on all Eighteen count and\nSo I Hope that Americans will at some point the evidence and we'll judge the\nEvidence and will make their own conclusion about the guilt of not just Trump but of all those around him who may be named um in any kind of report or indictment\n[noise] um yeah I remember seeing him on TV talking about it you know that you were you all were disappointed that you had your case all ready to go obviously against Nixon\nI mean that's my fear is that that I feel like we've never been up again I mean what he did his bad enough but to me Joe this is Watergate times ten is ... what is proven is what we all think which is you know announced the reason\nI I don't see how we just let this go just over the healing of the country we have to move on or whatever people are going to put forth right\nI agree I think if what we suspect is true is true if in fact there is collusion with a foreign enemy of ours\nThat is much more serious than using American to break into the Democratic headquarters if you're using rushing to electronically break and that is more serious if I mean\nWe see this evidence every day right now I mean his argument that it's a rogue operation how can you say the rogue operation of the Saudis yeah when they came in a charter plane\nThat has been used by the Saudi Government they brought a bone cutter with them yeah they they are clearly people who have been linked very clearly to Saudi security\nIt's not a rogue operation yeah to offer that is really stupid and I can't believe the president would be putting that out\nAnd I can't believe that any of his followers will fall for it\nYeah he always seems to\nSee it that well I mean as you tweeted any profit for Trump or his friends outweighs any concern about human rights and this is again where\nWe
