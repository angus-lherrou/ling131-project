with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brett how's it going\nTake heart a long time listener and a participant on your Clark Howard dot com message boards\nWell it's great to have you here\nThank you very much my question is a is a long time listener I Know that you you don't like debit card so I think you called them junk visas\nLet me say it in full their piece of trash bake visas and fake MasterCard\n[laughter] yeah and I understand why because they don't have the consumer protections for purchases but there's a there's a bunch of new products out that have really great cash back towards and I wonder if if those kind of one you over at all at least in some specific circumstances\nUm give me some examples let's take them one by one let's hear what they what they are and then what the benefit is you get much much to the um analysis of the benefits versus the risk\nOkay well the one I was thinking of ... one of the two is a target has a card that attaches to your checking account but it gives you five percent off on all your target purchases and I think it also doubles your a return period\nYeah I think they are doing the target red card which is a linear card for one purpose\nI think is fine because you're getting the benefits are so good with the five percent off and you also for a lot of things at target dot com get free delivery where people without the target read don't get free delivery\nSo I think that's worth the risk the risk is that if something happens in somebody's compromises the target red account number that they could have a field day buying things at target bitter emptying out of your checking account\nAnd so because it's a winning record only good there the risk is lower level risk then you'd have with one it was a visa or MasterCard debit card but the risk is still there\nYou said that right now there went also you wanted to run by me\nYeah it's kind of a new one it's from over its for ... drivers which you know anybody can actually qualify for but it has a really unique benefit it gives do one point five percent back on gas purchases at any gas station one used as a debit card which is kind of unusual because most\nMost of the time you have to use it as a charge so you can get a discount it they're really inexpensive stations\nSo are you a member of Costco wholesaler Sam's Club I sure am\nSo Sam's Club on their MasterCard you get five percent\nDiscount on gasoline\nAnd you can buy at a ... or you can buy at a discount gas out what you can buy at Sam's Club you can't buy at a supermarket gas pumps though are Costco\nCostco and the other hand you got four percent discount on gasoline and you can't use it at Sam's or at supermarkets but it's good everywhere else one like\nIn Atlanta but you have to pick a day off work to get gas at a Costco here in California\nYeah but forget Costco just go anywhere else you can use you use the Cosco card and you still get the ... the four percent oh I see so the difference is the one and a half percent isn't enough in my opinion to make that worth it\nWhere the five percent at target that's enough of a threshold that to me that's worth [noise] you're
