urging everyone to vote against them and if you want more information go to the people and the dot com\nAnd that will explain why you should vote again every and on and on the north Carolina ballot\nI appreciate are saying that I mean that's what happened to us in two thousand and eight when Brock Obama win the presidency and California probably has because of the wording on it was so bad that it said marriage equality and so people were like yeah some for marriage equality and if you voted yes you were actually voting against it\nBut it's such an important thing that I don't read these amendments and whatever the title is yeah is misleading so I appreciate that and that should be in every state every state\nOn caring and Ken said a staff a Tuesday show that called the complain the judges aren't identified as Republican or Democrat I wanted to know they can go to your state's Democratic Party website get a sample ballot will tell you who to vote for if you want to build a straight ticket this often includes issues if the party has a stance on them I Do it before every election on our friends and for my kids to\nThank you for that cause someone asked me about that the other day to make sense but judges don't supposedly have a political party they're supposed to be bipartisan but they're not we're using is really important fair judicial temperament of Brett

locations a group of students at a historically black University of Texas suing county officials for not providing enough for early voting locations on campus saying they're discriminating against ... based on their race and age\nI'm In no to the election officials failed to establish a single early voting location on campus during the entire first weeks polls are open this is all about Beto O'Rourke of ... you know what is laser targeted to a Heidi Heitkamp to federal Rourke\nOn the suit says limited early voting in Perry view um we're Seventy nine percent of the voting age population as black is illegal because nearby towns in the county with more voters who are less who are white and less of who were ages Eighteen and twenty I have many more early voting opportunities um ... yeah and this again they're saying that because of course\nBetter was is motivating young people minority people\nJust this morning and then someone will correct me if I'm wrong because that's what listeners do but I think it's the Dallas Morning news just actually endorsed them and that means every every major newspaper in Texas that has endorsed a candidate has endorsed Beto O'Rourke yes they don't read that earlier on and that's huge massive\nOne of the good things that just happened in Georgia I was just going to say oh you're talking about drugs were\nYeah so this is what I wanted to

replaced about ten years ago we heard about this during the Bush Kerry yeah\nThe people ... ... absolutely so they voted care and they saw on the machine flip it you're going what's that about the default goes to the Republican somehow or something I mean it's it's\nIf it's if it's touch screen that's where I was reading that it's real easy to just calibrate them so when you touch one for the screening registers\nYeah weird how it always yeah it was the Republican yeah yeah one of the things though and and just a positive note I don't know if you saw this but I'm In Georgia a judge actually blocked the election officials are rejecting the bouts with suspected signature mismatch ... absentee ballots we mentioned that earlier and yes you\nThat's what I'm saying I said earlier Dana democracy is hanging by threaten yeah but it's hanging and this\nAgain I Know when I when we were so repetitive at this point when you do this three hours a day we have ... and I do like the gong show [laughter] I mean he brought you to vote or we have right you're right right now the courts are holding on this stuff\nRight they're going to sit in the same thing we said the common sense of this
