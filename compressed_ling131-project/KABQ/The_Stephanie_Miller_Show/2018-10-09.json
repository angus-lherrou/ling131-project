have to do this the president doesn't get the square injustices this is bizarre and then you see what the hell is the rest of the court doing their\nDebts that are just supporting trivia actually off I mean\nBut you are being gene ban come on you're all last oh yeah you're sitting there at the freaking puppet show with John Roberts you're supposed to be the great institutional it yeah you know it would have set a hell of a lot about the independence of this year it didn't show up Charlie\nThink people realize that but thank you for tweeting about it right away 'cause I'm like he's already sworn in he's already adjusted this uh this is that like the zenith of our reality presidency relative reality show presidents like here's another Kim Jong un photo op for me to take a victory lap it was so ridiculous that innocence\nThat so that would mean that was the president's little part of the way people are even being a yeah I mean that's you know you don't get to do that either foul\nYeah Dr Ford don't it wouldn't get worse of than him physically mocking her at a rally I'm like yeah I'll\nGet a good I'm afraid is going to get worse for yeah for quite a while though uh but uh you know what you're going to get you know he's going to get to sit right sitting right away got cases coming in\n... a day yeah yeah it right to work you know yeah um yeah you and I I notice Miller cat\nYou by the way you wrote a whole peace about it you said wait judge for Brett Kavanaugh was told us he was nonpartisan as impartial I'm using a sitting Supreme Court justice who was already sworn in on Saturday is going to participate willing way in a meaningless masquerade of a partisan campaign event\nUh well we'll leave how disgusting it is to than anyone besides Fox is going to televise the puppet show for another time yeah thank you a worse it's a meaningless masquerade of a partisan campaign event that implies the Supreme Court justice must be sworn in by the head of the executive which is by at the moment headed by someone is ill suited to that office his cabinet is to him\nI mean right totally the whole thing is it legitimate presidents wearing an illegitimate Supreme Court\nPick a fight I mean\nThis was the straw that broke my back uh I I you know I I it's it's it's on it's unprecedented in history the republic you're you just don't do this\nRight and he said this stuff up and down and and this you know ridiculous like an op ed that he wrote as you said if\nHe was as dedicated to a nonpartisan independent judiciary claims to be he told the part he would have told the president politely out completely unseemly this spectacle with 'em but of course not he's been a partisan hacked his whole life\nYeah I mean the guy that got the guy the guy and radiological ambulance chaser basically yeah or if you've ever been in a courtroom is I mean he's been a judge has a ... you got a judge a federal judge typical political climate no I mean the whole thing's a mess and and it it's it's not a solvable mess that's the problem\nI mean if if if you guys in there and if you're not going to impeach it and all of that so\nI I got no tell me no [laughter] that's a pipe dream it's never going to have I well I don't I mean I I think the seven senators okay\nTo do it sixty seven and I don't care what how big the blue wave it ain't going to get sixty seven better plus you can't even get sixty seven Democrats probably\nDon't match it seems to be afraid of his own shadow yeah exactly well I think the whole party should be dedicated right now to getting Heidi Heitkamp reelected yeah I've never I've never been a fan but that took some got\nIt yeah it sure did I mean and also it's it's so rare 'cause we rarely ever see political courage these days and that that was

D ... anti women ... to ... here she is\nMy mighty hanging out and I thought you should hear exactly why I voted against judge Kavanaugh Bruce I'm honestly I don't think he told the truth\nAnd even if he did and he showed himself to be to buy in to be impartial I voted for new ... so I Know there are many other conservative judges who can do this job without carrying our country apart I approve this message because I Believe a senator has to put politics aside and do what's right for our country\nWhile they're out for her to give her some love you can get on your money over a work or if you can if you were wondering in North North Dakota go do it leaked golly alley I I I don't want to learn a lot now I\nDon't want to step on CNN speculation story yes but apparently Nikki Haley while talking about the resignation started lavish praise on about\nThat oh my God oh my God Raul with the nepotism and\nIt'll be complete defeat ... oh my God that\nGod okay\nHaven't mentioned this whole family ... means to go oh a Jody Hamilton discussing um you know judicial\nStuff as we do in commercial break there all the time [noise] yeah but\nListen I when I when I was saying I've said this over and over ... we got to stop bringing a knife to a gun fight we have to fight differently does not mean we need to lie and cheat and steal ... one of the things we were saying because Charlie Pierce was saying he is correct that is very difficult to impeach a Supreme Court judge but you know what\nMitch McConnell makes up a new new rural every day and guess what not only can you go to expand the Supreme Court to more seats you can shrink it up and I\nI absolutely would do it and guess what that would get rid of\nThe two illegitimate picks the Donald Trump pets remember we've said over and over again when Miller is done and he has proven to be a totally not just a totally illegitimate president but a traitor to the United states we better not do people keep saying can't we undo all was when they can't well in the constitution we actually can't can't\nAccept that except there are veterans name yeah there are ... and we just can't we've got to turn out in such big numbers that we have those options the very first Supreme Court was only six people right men\nRight there were ... and I know people have asked that question that I think that is really we've never been faced with this is if this is proven to be as\nI Believe it already has proven to be a totally legitimate election that that that is I think the first thing you would do because it's the last two on that are out and so anyway that is one solution I'm Colin Powell welcome to the resistance no kidding oh home\nEven though this is [noise]\nUm [noise] he scorched tromp on Sunday for placing a himself rather than the American people at the center of the nation he said my favorites rewards and our constitution or the first three words we the people who sounds like a William Shatner speech from start\nFor me to leave\n... but recently it's become\nMe the president as opposed to we the people and you see things that should not be happening he criticized Trump or insulting everybody from World leaders to blacks to immigrants to women for calling the media the enemy of the people said how can the president of United States get up\nAnd say the media is the enemy of Americans hasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the presses or what anyone says in the first amendment that's why we have though to protect that kind of speech as for immigration he said the world is watching it it's called the proper ministry in separate get separating migrant mothers and children ... ... it's all [laughter]\nYeah did you see there was a a immigration proceeding and the a child was too yeah she was too that had to speak right\nOkay um hey speaking of illegitimate [noise]\nWhich is kind of like Russia [noise] about a lover [noise] business or politics or election down to go yeah 'cause I was saying\nThey were all over the pro Kavanaugh like there were all those trolls um the criminal created a fake man's spreading video and the conservative media and the U.S help that go viral I mean I really feel like we are now it is Russia and the right wing of this country is against\nA patriotic American\nDuring the election they they exploited differences between racial yes they they'd be ... and now they're going after women trying to make\nWhen they were behind the taken neatly there yeah I Know this is all they want is chaos and division this is why they want to ... because of course they knew he would cause chaos and division or in this country conservatives in the U.S help spread of take a ... video against men spreading that resulted in the ... the backlash against women so they're\n... they're in their ... you know differences and the sexes and all ... all of this anger that has been you know uh obviously built up because of the Kavanaugh stuff the video before a purportedly shows a feminist woman pouring a mix of water and bleach on the crotch has multiple men riding on a subway who were men spreading\nUm conservatives in the U.S spread the body it's it's actors horse in it but you know then you get all these horrible sex is what I Want women are doing on gay marriage as liberal women the video stages extreme them feminist activism and manages to provoke extreme anti feminist reactions um [noise]\nYou know I for one would just like Americans in American issues and elections\nUnderway to get back to that you just pour hot coffee in
