about Hillary's treatment during the campaign but you tweeted his camera Harris ever lost it like this to be hounded out to D.C by the by the pun Nicholas Graham does it and he's been posted on cable news\nUm yeah ... that Lindsey Graham thing was ... was equally incident isn't seen as as Brett Kavanaugh's outbursts wasn't it\nYeah and and and I did that with a picture of the of Lindsey Graham who look demonic hurting\nBut it wasn't a particularly vivid snapshot of his melts out where he does this prima Donna act a ... and why did he and and just a quick point why did he jump in at that point yes prima Donna act right Dick Durbin had just\nPress Kavanaugh for five minutes or why don't you want it FBI investigation why won't you agree to one\nAnd there was this damage during answer I'll do what the committee wants well you're in charge you tell me a a a ... up until that point Republicans had had ceded to her woman prosecutor and that's where Lindsey Graham jumped in for his spotlight moment because\nYou knew devastating urban Kavanaugh exchange\nWhat Oh absolutely but I also think it's it's instructive when they showed the quote unquote female assistant aside when she asked him about the July first entry on his stupid calendar but of course all the names of Dr Ford said were there\nI mean it it's when she started to get close and I think said something like you know there's no statute of limitations in Maryland\nLike that was it you know\nI I mean I think it is a I mean the fact that they are even having her come out now and saying oh well I couldn't find any the of course you couldn't find any evidence and the way they said even if she basically said this was a load of crap at the end right\nWell yeah and she came up I I guess over the weekend she came up with this five point memos saying well I I wouldn't have brought charges and here the inconsistencies with Ford stories well she never addressed inconsistencies\nAnd Kavanaugh stories like he was hired by the GOP they they literally had behind her skirt and then what did she wasn't doing a good enough job duster overboard uh the whole thing was a total scam a sham obviously yeah now going for the question is\nYou know basically the White House is calling Jeff Flake a bluff we are going to do a sham investigation everyone knows it's going to be a sham investigation do you Collins and Murkowski are still vote yes or yeah or or or are you going to stand up and I you know\nGiving an undercover yeah\nYeah the obvious assumption is they'll they'll have but I think you know the pressure on the on the Senate is particularly Collins I mean I saw the video over the weekend hundred this mob was outside or Portland office yeah uh I think she's going to have a very long week\nAnd and we just don't know where it's going to go yet\nAll indications are now does the whole thing is it the fixes in yeah uh and and it just ... the two quick points just reiterate the White House is just terrified\nOf information coming out about ... I mean they hid how many millions of his documents right they went through this FBI they investigate yes we'll do it you can only interview for people and then the flip side of that is what is their obsession with confirming this guy\nYeah right well I think it's this this ... you know orange hatch I wrote a you know ... brief for this the first case that something makes you could make the ... basically Trump could pardon anybody and you can't you know prosecute on the state level again\nProsecutor and the state level or they're going to give ... you know Kevin out good Trump give Trump but get out of jail card free because anyone you know if Mueller proceeds a Kevin ... is going to be there to the other the other four to say well we'll we'll we'll you gotta wait till Trump's out of office we can't do this\nI mean the federalist society could come up with a list of Fifteen equally right wing judges almost equally right wing judges who could mean confirmed in a week what is this obsession\nWell I think I think it's going up the process just so this guy can get in and it's like\nI think it's everything we've said but I also think it's ... Trump's obsession with winning that you know this is going to be a huge loss and embarrassment for him and they're trying you know everything they can to make sure that doesn't happen\nYeah and the fact that the that that it's a revolving around women allegations of sexual assault that is obviously very sensitive topic for Trump and writes doesn't want to see the women and I think that's part yeah but it is just mind boggling I mean you know in any other nomination\nThis process would have ended nine different [laughter] I Know I remember I mean someone ... someone who withdrew because he smoked weed in college back in the back in the eighties yeah\nNo I Know well you know when you also treated you said to me there was something instantly recognizable about it as someone who grew up in a white suburbia ... culture in the eighties I knew a ton of guys like Kavanaugh that's how they talk and bullied and treated all of life or like everything was a ... game I mean I really was thinking my best friend back to the future\nNominated like the bully from karate kid I'm just you're right like we all recognize\nYeah yeah and the ... and the clip I posted was a very brief one and it was when White House was asking uh having about the F F F on the calendar and he said oh my buddy used his daughter when he said the F word and then he does this very quick imitation yeah\nAnd it just brought back like the eighties to me and he does he he kind of raises his fist like he's at a concert or a football game yeah and and he imitates his buddy doing the F you know dropping an F bomb yeah and to me that was like that\nThat was an ally in that that's not what the F F F but\nIt was a very brief window into eighties Kavanaugh right he's ready to present himself on this choir boy I'm On the Supreme but if you wanted to know how Kevin ... acted in the eighties that tiny little clip\nYeah was it and it was very disturbed ... run run amok and yeah\nI mean the whole thing everybody said right and like if you couldn't picture him as an angry drunk before now you can I\nMean that Matt Damon helped us on the um yeah my ...\nFantastic but you know I said that earlier before we do women quite seriously\nWe can laugh but that's SNL kind of stopped cement in the consciousness that this guy is an angry drunk and lunatic you know and I think it's ... it's going to be hard for them to outrun this well\nWho are willing to and you know it's funny right after a doctor for testified an ever went on cable news is saying this guy's toast this was incredibly\nPowerful she's credible what's he possibly going to do and I said you\nKnow a tree I said don't forget after Anita Hill testified everyone thought Clarence Thomas was done and he came back that night and they burned the place down and he won and that that was the exact strategy\nTrump out obviously ... you know gave him the strategy that we heard about Bob ... book deny deny deny never ...\nOr you know ... you know ... and turn it back on them and be angry right I mean you have yeah oh so\nShe'll capital was playing to an audience of one a ... and he he he was channeling a Clarence Thomas and I and I think he went far beyond what Clarence Thomas ever did with the mocking responses and uh but\nIt was incredibly rebel authority and the question is the Republican Party here or are they all and are they still\nPocket well at this point yeah\nYou know they're looking around but\nYeah I mean well in a in a poor choice of words and of course there is no good choice of words but you know or we talked about this this this loose in the army I Believe is going to be female and the you know the piece you wrote this week\nIt really ... the woman at the elevator it's almost a rallying cry right don't look away from me look at me and tell me that it doesn't matter what happened to me I mean it feels to me like that would be most voters are going to be saying in November but I Hope so\nWell the I think I I don't think the Republican Party understands the rage that is committed my my ... you know my wife has mentioned many times in the last three days um you know it unlike anything she has

was one thing she didn't say and that is that the hardworking men and women are the FBI should be able to do their jobs and on that I agree\nI'm Sorry is anyone offering but Kelly and said as a justice proof that it must be true okay and\nWhat we're hearing are reports that there's somehow trying to limit this odd to a few witness says or tell them what they should do\nAnd while the White House decides who they nominate and then that person is submitted to a background check I've never heard that the White House either under this president or other presidents are saying well you can

I've got I don't know about you but I've got friends I mean triggered all over the place in many ways a friend of mine who witnessed one not in the room it but at college witnessed a bunch of guys in her dorm\nYou know wind up in the ... there were so there are at the president was happening in the resident advisors room um but she saw the door open and the girl was drunk and she was from a different college was drunk and making the guy on top of her and she to this day is blames herself she's like she didn't have the tool box at that time and do what was happening and what she was supposed to do\nYou do north yeah words yeah but I had a thing is\nFor yourself because you're putting yourself at risk if especially if you're a single woman and she was saying that she saw you know years later she got a group\nEmail he was being honored for something you know for ... and that's the thing is like all this crap about you can't go to jail or you can't you know anyway okay alright Mazie Hirono again\nEven as a all of these accusations about this being politically motivated are being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nYeah and then no one more Senator Kyl\nThe thing is that every Senate vote matters and there's a there's time to get to the bottom of it even if it's seven days that's bad enough but then to limit the FBI as to the scope and who they're going to a question that is that really uh [laughter] [noise]\nI wanted to use the word farce but ah that's not the kind of investigation and all of us are are expecting the FBI to conduct\nHey Jan you're on the Stephanie Miller show\nHigh high\nHigh um I guess one of the country um\nWhen I was violently sexually assaulted I Will never the same things you remember\nI remember that I thought I Would find it die that they would never get born and I remember who get it of course yeah\nYeah you can't say you believe Dr Ford but but you don't think Brett Kavanaugh did it that that is not that the you know that's not possible no fifty eight minutes after the our ... live in Studio with us next\n[noise]\nNow the now the doing to make a difference\nNow's the time to take a stand to get involved to make a change now the time to do what's right\nFamilies to help the child\nKnows the time to volunteer to help habitat for humanity build hope\nAnd change lives with a family in your community [noise]\nNow the now\nVisit habitat\nNo now the time to make a difference now's the time to take a stand to get involved to make a change now the tone to raise [noise]\nAnd open a door to a new line of the time to help habitat for humanity build hope\nAnd change lives with a family in your community\nNow's the time now\nVisit habitat or\nI or radio you want to hear\nThem up and down by Gillette programmers know how to make I already have sound old I'm ... more germs Gary Randall Kennedy in ... he owed them challenge right now would\nBe in place by now but Senate confirmation of his nomination is delayed by the new FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against him\nTops of her hair out and then raped her in a rage and then she retracted it later when they were doing their financial settlement but I I don't think you just make something like that up you know that and then say Senate I tried to had her when she tried to say that oh I didn't mean it you know literally\nSo that he raped me or I'm like really is there another way to save\n... ... I'm sure he'll sue how do you do\nPay them winning every bad whom now here's the thing that men don't get a ... a researcher asked the question the question was what you do keep yourself safe from assault sexual and otherwise and then said to a person I don't really think about it and lemons dead you know I'm I like\nThe central west and I carry my cell phone or jog at night I lost the windows when I was a good summer and make sure my drink is served it all the time I don't get on an elevated long man or a man alone I don't use the rest area on the line on and on and\nOn and it's the men and sadly some women\nDon't understand that women\nAlways feel vulnerable women are only thinking we teach our girls how do you keep yourself safe at college in your community right rising\nIf they don't get that I Can't help them but I Will vote them out\nAnd the one little article came out yesterday was an article that said that we the voters men and women are watching and that every Republican senators in both confirms is completely on this guy deserved to be they will not vote for them and I can only hope that's true\nYeah so I was talking to the first hour about you know a couple of guy friends of mine um and I I just not being a parent\nI sort of shocked to burn all parents don't teach their sons as as you know one listener minds that to be protectors of women and not predators\nI mean these two friends of mine both had stories independently in College of helping 'em woman the got really drunk and passed out and do to get home safely and take her shoes off and put him to bed not to rape her I mean\nReally very simple again no means no consent is your responsibility to gang and it's and and now that you know we've raised his son we have a grandson\nNow that one of them than race bully stadium consent me what you you know it doesn't matter if in the middle of yes she said you know yeah I mean what can I just\nI don't think we have this idea to start a thank you movement in addition to the me to do the good guys you because I ... and look I see I did a lot of dumb stuff we all did you know in high school and college involving drinking in situations that I you know I shouldn't have put myself in but you know what ... and I get that I'm probably lucky but no I ever\nDidn't stop when I said stop\nBut every every one half for memory is different about sex it's about power yeah\nIt's about humiliation it's about this this through line of them doing it for other guys entertainment and they're laughing you know like\nThis case it can I just had three ... two things uh ... for\nFed if an added vocabulary Brett\nKavanaugh up your wildly he was either ... or he was having a man from it was really I have to think through nano pause now yeah honestly everything about how everything he did will be described if a woman had that and I know\nI Know I mean ... and ... and you just can be trusted to eleven and a half hours of Hillary Clinton right ... not crying not not screaming not interrupting right\nOh yeah yeah and I've heard one other thing I Want to give some advice and attorney on Twitter against whatever it's like when my goals and who I trust implicitly with his legal advice and I love when polls show\nThey're saying that you get the FBI you don't have to rely on them you every state has a\nAttorney general for the federal government we have a U.S government you know from the department of justice in Maryland is a guy named Robert her you can contact that off and filed a complaint about perjury we know Kavanaugh ally ...\nRepeatedly he lied yeah everything from the drinking age in Maryland to the mis delivered misinterpretation of you know of sex terms of course about you know being being a legacy yell\nAnd you know this July first thing on his stupid calendar is so interesting because you know said went to wherever for you know ... right with all the people the doctor for name someone made a great point through they said how would Fordham unemployed identify him by name to Kavanaugh's closest friends if she didn't know where we're headed barely met him\nI mean and then and then after that series of questions that included the July first question she never got speak again the the uh Mitchell\nRight I Am hoping I can only hope that uh well of course once once they were done hiding the opposite of drilling a woman had evaporated they didn't meet him or her anymore and it was Lindsey has to do his vapors thing you know I mean that was right\nWell they obviously losing on the law and on the optics and they're like okay time that you know huge political a fit right\n... ... well again every single one of them there's Pete my question is you pledge you know the ... or you pledge you know Donald Trump because obviously they have ...\nYou know he's the Merck house in dance all living in Alaska there from the lieutenant governor the citizens who are they supposed to represent all state not from this man and yet I think the votes will um\nAnd I I mean but at a you know that's a disgrace I mean you gotta know as women to eat how you watched I watched the did you do you watch a lot of it but how I how do you watch out there for you know she's telling the truth right I mean and the only dispute we've had to here is is\nWas Brett Kavanaugh so blackout drunk he doesn't remember it and I have to ...
