at all and then our guns all of us are planning a walkout for election day where there were students are going to leave their schools and they're going to march on down to their local precinct and vote\nGood these are things that we're not hearing about in terms of young voters and I I'm skeptical just as much as anyone else in terms of the young voters turning out but that bad in particular is good news\nYeah well I mean just five you treated among other people you said there is an exodus of women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump\nAnd again yeah the matter how they try to keep spending this cabinet stuff and Trump's ego women love in women are very angry about the Democrat hoax at like ... no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women all of a women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has CNN's new generic ballot will has women opting for democratic candidates sixty three to thirty three gender gap as the net\nThirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time about this blue wave is going to be female but I also say well you see every day don't get happy don't focus on any polls don't because there was one showing democratic enthusiasm way down after the Kavanaugh thing for a day and everybody freaked out right\nYeah well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality is that we kinda are in a place where we have to scare our own people into voting you know like literally we got to get a lot them they have to go to door to door to scare people\nGet voted out does just knock knock knock chow chow chow okay\n[laughter] I look at the trick or treaters right you won't even\nGo just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door\nUntil they come down you know scared enough to vote\nBut I mean it's it's true but I think we're underestimating the number of\nVoters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so\nWho are fed up and and now's the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted we'd have the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party\nYeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and then changed the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm\nLike I was saying it it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted a yes the electorate has was transformed this November we will experience in Nineteen Ninety two year the woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keeps saying voting by mail was a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr own a lot of these machines broke who sell well\nYeah and and as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans\nAre perpetrating lock her up and this is three or four days after Donald Trump stood up and lectured us about due process not presuming someone was guilty before they're\nProven innocent you know it's just like this is now\nI Know of all of all the Nikki Haley theories that is her resignation letter was written the day he started mocking Dr Ford yeah yeah maybe she's just like the little you know they might have joined ongoing yeah\nNikki Haley Nikki Haley's leaving because of cabinet oh I think Nikki Haley is going to run for president I think all of the platitudes shoes delivering yesterday
