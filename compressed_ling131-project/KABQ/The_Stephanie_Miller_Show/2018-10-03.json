allegations\nAnd [noise] okay [noise] um Dick Durban talking about ah this\nI Would say there are probably true or not or know what they're going to do\nA fabulous no we want us to this point so I thought of it really comes down to three Republicans who are the ... century it was they should just point undecided should decide to move in the direction of voting against judge given off I think

right I'm\nHis testimony doesn't have the ring of truth either and a lack of candor and witness in one area raises questions about the integrity of that witnesses testimony and other areas\nThat the law by the way and this is a longtime friend upright cabinets but they're not releasing those letters right on Senator Chris Coons yesterday\nIt certainly is striking a first in the way that it pushes back very forcefully against the president's own narrative of himself as a self made man a host the million dollar ring loans that he had to pay back from his father or this article and start to get documents\nOf it or see something like four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in today's dollars in value inherited from his father that's a significant portion\n[noise] and just yet another six\nForget lie that he has told them win over senator kings again [noise]\nAnd then second it goes through ways in which\nThe president avoided paying taxes a tax avoidance efforts or a scheme that may come up against the line of fraud or cross over it um as you mentioned in the introduction the president um denies all of these allegations and says this was done by tax\nProfessionals but there's maybe one important insight into why he is the first president modern times than not release his tax returns\nDe in San jose you're on with Carlos and company hello\nOh momma handle so great to talk
