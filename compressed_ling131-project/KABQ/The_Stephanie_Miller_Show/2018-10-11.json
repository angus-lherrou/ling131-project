tremendous it's really wet big you know it was and then he died in an addict only from the standpoint of water\nYeah he sits at the desk of his arms crossed change like sure this is just as a reward came Armstrong nobody saw it like yeah yeah and not let me let me just remind you of this\nIt's almost like a pretty good it's like a tornado a massive tornado\nYeah oh God I mean we're really windy it's a big sorely thing yeah and and and I mean let's not even get into the fact\nThat he didn't bother to cancel his rally in Pennsylvania yesterday the panhandle was seeing the worst storm ever seen a and and he's like I don't want to disappoint by fans I think Erie, Pennsylvania will get over you're\nGonna be\nNo doubt in my I found out okay I'm over at okay everybody let's regroup you'll need\nIs the first time in what six years that I've done it sorry about that yeah that's what we're saying of an angry mob I was going to say and brings out the anger and I haven't gotten my thorough check yet I'm a little bit [laughter]\nI mean we knew that we've done to go work in the workforce they run to work in the ... you need to know where\nHe can get that what it was a plant a baby first dump 'em yeah speaking\nOf which you said go ahead and call me the angry left you're damn right I'm angry angry gets done a angry with boats angry pushes close minded sexist old men out of power I've never been more proud to be angry thank you friends friends both angry we shouldn't\nYeah I get riled up that's what this is all about at this point um I don't\nI think the rhetoric is dangerous um but we know that Trump's hell is he always accuses somebody else with exactly what he hit what he's been doing in the beginning so he's he's in charge of the angry mob these ginned up the angry bother you surrounded by I mean just look at the way they treat the press at these rallies\nThese are this is you're angry mob right here yeah I it makes me think that maybe somebody is getting paid on his side to show up and stand in those bleachers Diaz\nAnd we're back you these accusations of of sorrows money is laughable right I mean I you know again it Gabby Giffords ... where where do you want us to start Heather hire a ... a anyway\nI mean it it it's the one who will you will you also said Trump as an idiotic new go to stick during his rally or some guy yells I Love you and he responds I Love you to you're not my type\nYeah how about like I'm a married man in my Seventy [laughter]\n\nHe said he thinks it's brilliant on the crowd and ... him as as the ... when I was just saying this yesterday to give all the things that he was ruined in America\nIt's comedy is one of the more I'm just like don't stop nothing he says his vaguely funny he's lowered the bar these more on the west but like I Would ever get stupid impressions oh\nBut that's the Republican do too and I don't mean to generalize but it's because I'm that way every time somebody on the right to something really really stupid they end up saying he was a joke like right in the sense of humor if anybody right not none of this is funny right\nLet's talk about a ... obviously is a energy of enough to be Russia dot org or if there's so many ... it's hard\nTo know look which bombshell was the most uh um what do you call it a you know significant but Richard NATO the California computer was caught by all the special counsel's office selling selling fake online identities to Russians was sentenced to six months in prison and six months from probation um what how significant is that\nI think it's significant in the fact that it's another layer of the more investigation\nThat he is pursuing penalties for everybody who is wrapped up in this in some capacity and I think it's a reminder of how many facets there are ... I think that it's\nEasy I mean the reason we created investigate Russia and the first place was because it's very hard for people to keep track of all of these different threads with all the other news going on at least you have everything in one place and work at\nAll we do right so the idea is that easier losing track because there's so many other distractions that\nWe have the latest compiled all in one place without anything else and so you know that's a way to keep track of all of the other aspects of this that are going on I I think it's important to keep in mind that mole are still working even when we have all these other distractions that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Stephanie Miller Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "11"}
