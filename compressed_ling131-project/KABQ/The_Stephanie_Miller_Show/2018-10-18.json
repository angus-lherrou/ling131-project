him\nAnd he was down around a A R B\n\n\nIs with us on the Clark Howard show Hollis Thomas [noise] how close are you doing today great thank you Thomas how can I serve you\nJust had a question a chemical so the state was asked a site\nOn the computer the other day and I was just wondering it might be ... to ...\nSo what exactly do they do\nA it's like a [noise] a site they deal with a apartments commercial property will pop into battle was like a thousand dollar minimal or is it ...\nOn the reviews that channel and they all seem to be pretty good I just wanted to get your take on it\nSo you with their own um individual you would own little parts of individual properties and they would then pay you a supposedly whatever profits there are they're paying you overtime right\nOkay and how much do you have to pay to be involved in this\nWell for the minimal wanted to have a slight a hundred dollars to be a stall\nNo but how much in fees do they charge you\nKnow I didn't see it\nAuto ah okay who is a hot thing on the Internet right now with these ah organizations\nPutting together a little real estate investment firms where they go out and use your money\nTo buy a individual houses by a small apartment complex to invest in a little office building whatever and you're just putting money in\nAnd they charge you fees to get involved usually it would be calm and that you pay two to five percent of your money up front\nFor going into it and then ongoing X\nEach ear that tend to be another one to two percent right but the fees are charging you are on top of them handling the books they're the ones that decide\nIf their particular buildings that they're running that they're making money or not\nAnd remembers says they're controlling the books you have no way of knowing if they're putting expenses in there that really shouldn't be in there\nSo they're not reporting big profit so there's not a lot of money for you\nSo I don't like these are private kinda placements or you put your money and if you're interested in and being involved in real estate and not actually having to manage any property\nThere's a really easy simple way for you to do it and that's to go into a um real estate mutual fund\nGood and my the cheapest of all of them out there from a company you may have heard me tell you I Love the Mets vanguard why do you do any stuff with vanguard\nDo but I definitely heard of\nSo if you go into one with vanguard or Schwab or fidelity or whatever it will be ultra low cost you won't have upfront fees you have to pay\nAnd they're managing it they're managing the investment only investing in organizations that they have reason to believe are doing everything as they should\nSo it's much safer path for you to get involved in investing in real estate been in a private kind of offer like this where you have really no say so or oversight with how they set the budget and what part is for you [noise]\nYou're listening to the

allies we can get and I apologize in advance of by drunk dial dial you to discuss the Iraq War at some point\n... already but that's okay bill um but I have\nTo say I I've said this before and you know ... is a good friend of mine it for a lifelong Republican as you know obviously a lot and you're not the only prominent Republican that is a you know whenever you want to call yourself right uh never Trump or but\nFrankly I think speaking in some cases with more passion an urgency then I hear some people on our side speaking because I I feel like you see not just your country but your party going up in flames um\nHow where did you come from to get here\nI think that's right and obviously you know it's always the case right if something you've been part of\nStarts to go down the tubes are blows up your care more about it in a way that the people who always been different or maybe even hostile to that that outside of the equation I think everyone should be concerned because it's good for the country to have to you know reasonably healthy political parties where the differences are within certain bounds of\nYou know accepting the norms of liberal democracy the institutions\nOr you know try to have a civil civilized debate about policy you could get pretty heated sometimes but but really Trump takes the Republican Party in a very different direction there I think it's bad as I say for Republicans or conservatives but really for the country because Democrats are good with every election and you don't want the alternative party or do something that's\nReally nativist and authoritarian and with very little or no regard for basic norms and\nCurtis these situations a liberal democracy\nYeah well I agree with Max Boot another conservative writers ... version of the Republican Party needs to be burned to the ground so from the ashes we can build a decent center right party in America again I mean bill you probably know my dad ran with ... speaking of lifelong Republicans and was chairman of the Republican Party right I just don't\nI I I don't think they would recognize this isn't a Republican Party is it this is Trump is this is this is a cult of some sort\nOf that is both ... and the sort of willing switched positions on things just because of what Trump says and also\nYou know for the popular foods that are public in a way that a little hard to have them or they want to have a flower doesn't need and hurt anyone obviously it's a democracy and\nBut I'm the degree to which I mean just Trump's appeal to bigotry or the kind of shame with of it it's one thing to have every party has you know an attractive Allen's than people who go over the line and so forth I both sides but this is that the president of the United states the leader of the party the president country\nDo this right now he's tweeting about\nThis caravan of migrants coming up four thousand people coming up from Honduras or whatever the right policy is in terms of stopping them or not stopping them or which one do you stop or how that yeah you know ... or questions at the border and so forth but this is a pure appealed to date of as a demagoguery\nElection issue yeah let's not talk about health care less about the dad let's not talk about foreign policy let's just get one alarmed four thousand people may or may not come into the United states now because there were three\nBecause it was on Fox and friends I mean it it's just it's CERN I you know bill and I I my listeners are probably tired of this but my dad was a prosecutor Nunberg and I just\nI I I thought we not these are bad I thought we had that was like a settled thing here I mean when when I when we all want all the things we've seen when we look look at Charlottesville and we looked at it Helsinki I mean it just\nIt it it is and now the Saudi Arabian thing bill you tweeted Trump isn't being played or con by the Saudis Trump is very much in on the ... house with Trump in the house is on our collaborators in the cover up\nThat should be horrifying to every American right\nYeah I mean you can take the positions on foreign policy we'll lift types would that look it's terrible what happened we should probably factions and people but at the end of the day the U.S Saudi relations is too important to let it be blow it up for one\nOr even one very grizzly and terrible murder that's a I don't agree with that but that's a position people could argue and foreign policy journals and op ed pages and politicians can make the case but you know we should go after the arms deal or whatever that's one thing\nBut to pretend that we don't know what happened to pretend that might come to the secular state that a fact finding trip\nTo pretend that it's you know the personal relationship between the king and Trump or or uh uh the friends that are around France Jared Kushner is going to overcome the fact is is really ridiculous that it does make us kind of not just because

things and yeah you're reading now and I think Malcolm Nance talked about it a little bit yesterday though that this is probably being used as leverage by the Turks to get concessions out Trump Administration so that they won't embarrass the Saudis and Trump\nBy releasing additional information that they've gathered now\nTravis sorry was something else off all happened\nUh yeah I'm On the front and right now uh the headline is Turkish media claims that sounded like the alleged did 'em all she'll be killing has been accidentally killed in a traffic accident [noise]\nOh was there always ... well one of the guys yeah was accidentally killed the houses are interesting yeah\nYou know when you when you collide with um [noise] an airbag people don't know this but sometimes use some tiniest Lincoln bust into a million different pieces\nYes yes apparently um\nYes wow it's just like a Russia weird how many people are having a you know accidents getting to the I mean it it is amazing isn't it hard we're in the middle of another huge international scandal in which\nPresident is probably going to be criminal implicate ... ... if someone said we should called ... but I doubt that ... that are\n... think of it this way there is no way there are not cameras all over this conflict and the streets around them\nBut yeah it floods which which is the euro chance which begs the question Carl are they that brazen that they yeah I mean obviously the way they killed him was to send a message and you just think what they have to know that that it's good that they're that it's going to be recorded\nI mean okay I don't I [noise] okay um\nWell when you control the cameras and everything else you know and you know the Trump not going to do anything to hold you accountable by the way you're yeah yeah no go ahead more likely to you're more likely to do whatever the heck you want\nYeah I hear is by the way John Brennan or listen to him real quick\nWell I think Donald Trump and the White House is trying to protect the relationships that we know safe hosts from Saudi Arabia but also their personal relationship with and the U.S [noise] I Would hope that a Trump and others are getting daily if not more regular\nIntelligence briefings from CIA and others about what it is that we know I think this is the challenge for less ration because I'm certain that CIA has a lot of the nation about this and\nThis is why I think ... is trying to figure out what's the story he can provide that's going to stand up to scrutiny or in line with U.S intelligence ...\n... ... ... it's\nExtraordinary because now Trump is going to of course we caught\nAgain in his you know however many lies a day he tells right but then as anyone going to ask him like oh so they lied to you then if they now admit this right because he's when he ... he obviously has already on record as saying that they said they had no idea about any of this\nHoops Karl\n... see what happened oh there you go okay go ahead and\nUh you know and not only that um you know he's basically showing that he is gullible [laughter] you know this is the guy who says he's a great judge of character can make a good deal et cetera um and when he's\nYou know when it's proven that he was lied to um we're only one step away from proving that he knew what was going on and uh and he lied to the American people about it [noise] um ... either that or he has to come out and say that he's not the guy with the best judgment in the world\n[noise] um how you're a campaign strategist how dumb as it to come out how many days before a mid term election if you're Mitch McConnell and say we're going to cut ... your Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nOh it's beyond foolish um and uh but you have to remember ... whenever they're given the opportunity or they will run with it and so I think of what happened in twenty sixteen right Republican lost seats in the house they lost seats in the Senate\nUm and yet they've done all of what they've done over the last year and a half two years right now even if\nThey lose the majority in the house\nAnd Senate majority doesn't grow\nThey will not stop until they are completely ah rendered and capable of moving their their priorities forward and we've known for a long time that their goals are to\nRuin Social Security and to ruin Medicare uh this is something that they've been pushing for for decades and remember it's what slapped back President Bush\nTen Fifteen Years ago when he came out after ah the midterms and said right next up we're going to privatize Social Security and it just about cost him a the majorities in Congress well\nAnd by the way democratic leaders in congressional candidate had been arguing for months that that these tax cuts are there are going to cause this and so you're right I mean so here comes a big gift and we're like this is what we told you\nThey were going to do I'm I'm looking at uh the we have a big fundraising advantage obviously there are Thirteen ... but you know I keep saying grown I'm sure you've had you know that there's many campaigns have you been through is just ...\nThose obviously those stories make us happy but then you just go don't listen to any told listened to you know the races where they said it's already over or you know ... right\nI mean everybody just needs to close their eyes and imagine one of two things happening the day after the election\nDo you want to see a happy President Trump who is mocking Democrats\nAnd talking about uh how we're all a bunch of losers and see he was able to pull this out and blah blah blah blah blah or do you want to see an angry President Trump that doesn't stop tweeting all night long about how it's not his fault yeah\nHe's already said that it will be his fault court because nothing ever as well yeah\nWe want to see a meltdown like we've never seen before with this president the only way to do that if you usually give money give more if you don't usually go door knocking\nKnock on more doors have usually make phone calls make more phone calls do twice as much as you usually do and when you got one vote bring your neighbors bring your friends bring your family\nYep I'm this sums it up Jeff tweets no one could have predicted that the party of Nazis child molesters wife leaders con artist embezzle or stock market cheaters pedophile wrestling coach is compromise Russian assets in blackout drunk rape is judges would also be the party of bone song murder apologist um [noise]\nIf you don't if he ... he needed he had a reason to vote for all that more decency a\nAll that and one hundred and forty characters yeah I I mean it it really um it it and it's so stressful isn't it personally like of grief I just I Want my stomach lining hold out until November six but okay [laughter]\nYeah you as well as to block take our alright loving already seen hardly Ari Eighteen minutes after the hour\nThis portion of

and documentaries and ... obviously Malcolm Nance has always their first the plot to hack America was the first one but you know ... there's lots of great I'm\nActive measures the documentary her book is a cyberwar how Russian hackers in trolls helped elect a president what we don't can't and do know a Kathleen Hall Jamieson was Jackie's professor actually a law at Penn\nAnd she offers a forensic analysis a includes the Russia\nDeliver Trump's vigor which I think we all know but she just comes at it from a scholarly and it it is fascinating I've been reading some of that she's widely respected by political experts in both parties um she was asked point blank would Trump the president without the aid Russia and she said no um she uh yeah she ...\nShe currently like\nYou're welcome to the moon stuck in your head now [noise]\nI don't feel like we had enough of that to get really get stuck in people's heads you know we have to knock ... outlets get that back you know we'll go we'll close

decades worth of academic studies about what kinds of persuasion can influence voters under what circumstances it's good to know since we're about to vote again yeah right um\n[noise] she said you can affect people into than a change their decision that alters the outcome\nOr I'm arguing they persuaded enough people to either vote a certain way or not vote at all\nA Russian mastermind she said pulled off a technological and political coup moreover she concludes the American media inadvertently help them achieve their goals but being on the lookout because we don't know if Russia still involved and they they are very likely are with a lot of these voter disinformation things and um\nYou know racially division divisions than other owns Oreo if we can just go back to that that's fun\nFor other divisive things but just be aware of that right before well before you both to sign\nAll right well of course now I'm going to have to come back with ... that's fine fifty eight minutes after the our ... over [noise]\n\nTo fire I'm Michaeline secretary's day long you been dating rising from the White House about ... ... it was saying no announcement is coming today on what President Trump may do about the king of Saudi Arabia and who's crown prince and their denials they had nothing to do with the suspected murder of ...\nWise about everything right everything yes um anyway uh he's\nOut the ... last week the Washington Post fact checker column recorded Trump's hundred and ten billion an arms sale in Saudi Arabia is still fake calling a hundred and ten billion dollar figure fanciful and unlikely to come to fruition um he's a over a year ago the Brookings Institution called it fake news\nHe said most of the publicly announced items have been previously announced by the Obama administration appear to be few if any sign contracts rather many of the announcements were Emily ... memorandums of interest there were six specific items adding up to twenty eight million but all had been previously notified the Congress by the Obama administration\nSo even that fake there is no hundred billion dollar Saudi arms deal it's not like\nRoberts is fans even though the arms races there probably picturing a bunch of rednecks doing handstands trying to get past the finish line [laughter]\n[noise]\nOkay I was just so we I was as I Would say the bill Kristol earlier\nBut I Know it's Trump isn't this isn't a Republican Party it's it's a cult\nWhereby they go hey we love the Muslim ban and we have Muslims boo oh you know\nIt's for however many of the nine eleven hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and now they have killed in an American permanent resident with a bone saw for seven minutes while he was alive and they're all like oh yeah yeah we like those Muslims Saudi Arabia great because Trump's that so [noise] it there's no\n... it is so infuriating\nAll of it I was out of the country for a week and my blood pressure had never been lower I stayed off Twitter I only checked maybe once a day maybe once every three days\nAnd it was the most peaceful week I'm two years and then I come back and you just cannot avoid it it's ... it's there's constant inundation by the news cycle now everywhere you turn it's unbelievable\n[noise] um yeah\nAnd I just have no moral core anymore no moral leadership here is a a hertz with her\nWhile he was a citizen of this country but one thing that we're going to determine that and you don't know whether or not we have to do but you know whether or not we should be a bit [laughter] I'm not going to try to\nSuppress what would I says\nWhy are you laughing with why it was wrong with people at a person that has a U.S with a degree it was our Washington Post reporter it'll get rid of it has the same that residents have the same status as ... parents\nYeah very good comparison with Miller thank you [noise] he gave me I'm On my own life over in order to get your investigation mhm [noise]\nOkay ah yeah as a blood is again here we go\nThough I just want to find out what's happening in fact secretary of state of asking me back to probably late tonight or early tomorrow morning they wouldn't have certainly wasn't all over the voters but a lot of time with the ground French and he's going to have a full report that given governmental\nHow about the optics that Emily ... giggling and smiling and laughing Pompeo shaken hands and then fill it up we didn't talk about that yeah but we're not talking about facts\nYou literally the White House literally admitted that\nThey are trying to create a story to cover up the murder\nYes of a Washington Post journalist it's an insanity they're admitting that they are living like we're just trying to will try to gather and just figure out a story to yeah\nYeah it's all the facts that we go okay yeah I don't want to talk about any of the facts snow otherwise for they they did Weiner either and if they want to yeah\nFor if you look in Saudi Arabia there in LA and there is tremendous purchaser\nOf not only military equipment but those are the things when I when my ... my friend committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things had hundred and ten million dollars worth of military life online for those are the ... orders of the history of this country\nProbably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been any orders for four hundred and fifty billion dollars\nYeah for instance I'll let up my own life and you know what else will do I'll take my own work you know\nMy phone also just lit up and Washington posted ... recommends to Trump to give Saudi Arabia a few\nMore days to complete the investigation the disappearance of the journal what's that I'm Sorry ... told them to give a Saudi Arabia a few more a few more days into the investigation observatory to get a ...\nBy some more bleach and stuff I heard the uh even painted the walls of the room where this happened I mean there which we could see a cleaning crew going in before they let the investigators will yeah what's your friend and whichever okay and your partner I'm John Brennan former CIA director talking about this\n... is an extraordinarily powerful individual who wheels full power in Saudi Arabia\nAnd something like this going after a U.S residents of journalists the Washington Post and I saw in the ... emission abroad would require his personal authorization in my estimation of because this is something that to individuals would not carry out on their own ...\n[noise] yeah that seemed like Hubble planning involved\n... men that he respects Payton with Saudi guy that I don't know his name and the U.S think full full Mr Bones full power they have full power they make people disappear ... or ... feet that's exactly what Trump wants to be we know that that's why he respects\nAnd yeah you know it it makes deals with these guys he wants to be them yeah exactly one more John Brennan\nI don't I don't know what they were thinking of where they just going to go in there and that sort of get him and bring him back in this went wrong I don't know but ah the the size of the delegation that went there and some of the individuals involved to look so these are members of the Saudi royal guard who come directly under ... [laughter]\nSo uh this is something that maybe ... a month or he could get away with because of the very close relationship to the house with the White House he just very badly miscalculated booth the impact of this\nWe thought the bones saw was a low it's like you're not saying\nWe have to talk I brought up on so we didn't think he was plugged in where he did switch did not nose plugged in we got ... to an interrogation if you're just planting okay to talk a Ricky in Montana you're on within a company hello\nHome girl I Want to try to talk to you to go ahead with Trump is coming to Montana where I live in a town with like Seventy three thousand yet the third largest city in the state yeah [noise]\nAh we've got this email ... former GOP chairman\nIslam is will they shot senior who has written that face the those that appears to be urging people to bring guns to this\nRally were set them eight thousand are expected to shop you know ... rhetoric of that a mob rule and all that stuff yeah oh my God I just think that they're trying to um get people to start beating each other up\nYeah he's I mean Ricky this um what was this guy the Proud Boys this get wiped the premise is gang yeah I mean they're very actively encouraging violence I mean in ... and it is scary you're right but we cannot allow the bullies to to scare off\nWell they think well maybe he gets caught if you don't mind any faith but those that heat but in yeah this will dish out\nOkay for all the prospective attendees to the run that if the rough that Trump event [laughter]\nCome early also all you protestors show up as well it says that can fields and open carry state and we know how to use them the M right and it signed you as in the train and it was that guy yep boomer\nYeah do you not to not be afraid that the one careful be safe but to not be afraid it's also someone who should immediately be banned from whatever social media platform there are literally are asking to invoke violence with guns at ... at a at a public yeah but the sanity\nWhat's his name uh Gavin McGinnis this is the guy the far right and a video he or she was far right extremist Gavin McGinnis calling for a and again there is no he was at an official Republican event yeah\nThere is no difference now you know uh what is this something another story Travis about a white supremacist ... you know talking about his plan to insult\nIf they're going to see that this was a a real investigation like are we taking one person that on our side like what's going to happen that you placate everybody [laughter]\nShe'll say OK sweat what what are his knees left me bus you I'm Glad you what's going on with that molecule that would actually be a man he when he nine minutes after the our ... studio\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nNo one wants to be in an accident but the fact accidents happen so if you've ever find yourself in a motor vehicle accident remember these three to some more seek medical attention if necessary and coal grieving walk by five four\nTwenty Seventy nine Richard revenge is ready to fight for you he's worked in the insurance industry he understands insurance adjuster and he knows how to make them uncomfortable don't hesitate all the way in an accident Colby injury experts that creep into law by far more twenty Seventy nine\nFormer means rammed powered even more John ... white now ... percent for Seventy two month old to solve it ain't going to solve the Nineteen lamps you've seen on who's twenty five hundred and thirty five Montrose\nUsually here in the news on Germany charges and shows to shop dot com\nDo John just knowing how old were you saying she was shot of less ...\nNation for details\nThere are over a beer or two a day on the radio\nGene how are we going to focus on the scary thing to do with the radio original vision Halloween radio commercial free et cetera both wind area [laughter]\nBoth picked that perfect Halloween costume while you're\nGoing to be with the radio on I already\n[noise]\nTo have an email or a job where we we did guy do how to whip up with the audience just short of a friend [noise]\nOkay\nIt is the Stephanie Miller show yeah hey I can Kate Milwaukee is going to Chicago sexy liberal next Saturday Hi Kate show ...
