when I ... yeah I I just I I I like my TV I don't want to do things that I\nYou still have capacity actually anymore to have any more than I already do mhm\nHe's just doubling down on the issue is I mean I was wondering you're having a you know Supreme Court nominee and controversy with the lady people read really I mean he was known as you want to ... to ... and not just one\nReported the when everyone was talking about was of course the seal your burger 'cause he was like oh you were thinking of you never do\nAnyway but then first of all it's a press conference the first amendment you can ask whatever question you want word\nOr we're we've got the audio book you want to hear that one too which won the uh the other the other reporter\nIdaho at the ... he just the way his tone at me I Can't oh no no you been in that you see do you see them and what was the O. C. Caitlin Collins yeah is that the one you don't get that if you're on your yeah yeah yeah what's your\nThinking Mr President now that you've answered several questions on trade I'd like to try to John ... do you have new out she has me do you have a question of ... one or two more questions or several questions don't do that does not identify somebody has to be voice excuse me don't do this\nDo you have a question on trade he went through several choir you have a question on trade my question is on jacket shift you say\nWow he's so awful yeah yeah\nAnd okay we ... you know what we do need to hearing more about your stupid trade deal 'cause it's Obama's trade deal that you just put your name on\nYou more honest [noise] Tracey I Know when he was famous for giving a building of putting his own name on it\nTries to make it seem like you know this is some of course big when are the deal though I ... I made a whole new deal for me the\nVanity Fair mission accomplished Trump's new NAFTA deal is a lot like the old after this trade deals essentially a re brand of the old one I mean he is such a condom carnival Barker one more people get it\nUp to smoke MSNBC is saying no this is actually freer trade\nBut after ... off all our allies and for what ... he does this with everything anyway in the first thing a\nWhile he's yet to strike newer better alternatives for the Iran deal or TPP or is this one I guess you know it's I don't even know it's something unpronounceable but he's now renamed it and they said the contentious ugly seemingly endless rounds of negotiation or the middle of the new agreement is\nWait for it extremely similar to the old agreed on mhm um yeah the ah it Canada will open up its dairy market to more American products but as the New Republic points out the opening is similar to what the us would have gained through the TPP to wit TPP would have opened up three point five percent of the Canadian dairy market while the new agreement\nWill give the the us access to three point six\n... meaning so this small concession try out at the God\nTrumps noon after the one he wrecked diplomatic relations with Canada and roiled current currency markets in order to secure is basically Obama's TPP with a bomb was named paper it over by a gilded Trump sticker um this is according to experts this isn't me this is a bunch of different and or not and liberal publications\nUm the reality is that America is expended a tremendous amount of national political capital pretty modest changes President Trump is claimed that NAFTA at one point oh it was the first worst trade deal in us history and helped make America poor country is though that it's hard to see how NAFTA two point oh changes that status quo or is it now or just a really bad trade deal\nI mean yeah luckily Trump will undoubtedly be using this quote unquote victory as an excuse to hit other countries with more tariffs after all the patented Trump process worked exactly as planned if not advertise discard an Obama era agreement\nOr ... cause as much economic dysfunction as possible insult your counterparts terrify Wall Street than dust off the hold agreement with a few small tweaks mission accomplished without terrorists we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those\nThat he said uh just for those babies out there to keep talking about tariffs\nCould we call people that think therapy or a bad idea baby baby [noise] but [noise]\nBut that's right that it really is true it's almost like everything any policy rip up whatever Obama did make a big get trashed everybody ... make a big deal out of it come down with a huge new injury right that's I\nThink it's\nOkay oh All right oh no this is him talking about uh drinking\nRaw flood\nSo if he did lie about his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think he did\nHere's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life than chi right so one of my totally good traits I don't [laughter] whatever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason\nCan you imagine if I had or what a mess that they would I Want to be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay\nOkay okay that's the only true things ever said I think so yeah\n[noise] okay oh ...\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man was drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty less tornadoes ... bad about him\nNo that's not maybe you should ask yeah mine up rates that might be let go investigate\nThat yeah um yeah I mean we were we were saying that Mr gambling guts and but he had already made it to the point of saying Kevin has strongly denied having a\nProblem with alcohol thing he just drink beer occasionally like everybody else so Trump obviously like undermined his own nominees defense once again a\nHe said I think he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot no\nHe lied about that as well ... yeah exactly okay and then about the accusers\nShould be FBI interview all three of Brett Kavanaugh's accuser [noise] uh it wouldn't bother me at all now it depends I don't know all three of the ... all three certainly I imagine they're going to interview to the third one I don't know much about but it wouldn't bother me at all I mean I've been heard\nThat the third one\nAs I have no idea this is true has very little credibility\nShe's got the sworn statement right under penalty of perjury in\nThese ridiculous attacks on all the Democratic senators used personal you know attacks on Blumenthal and Feinstein and really like Dianne Feinstein the body you know posture is is the issue here\nOh it was very good buddy what what do you call buddy labor body language not very good very good what does he mean by that I Am always talking about Cory Booker bookers duty we what do you do when he was younger and like\nWay huh she's just such a ... he was black when his younger\nOh was

assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault on then it was horrible\n[noise] ah so when I say you know there is a through line with all these ... ... you know allegations and many of them independent of each other never ... or ... and obviously Dr Ford told the same thing about being pushed into a room but again the same thing with Dr Ford\nShe specifically said like I don't know who pushed me like it it's interesting when someone's telling the truth\nThey don't know every detail whereas you know Brett Kavanaugh's denials are all like ... and you know and and yeah and completely like over the top ...\nTo the degree that they're not even believable but ah so this is her saying I I you know I Can't be if again if she if you're gonna make a false allegation to the FBI and and lose all your security clearances and your livelihood when you you know I mean first of all when you say yes it was definitely Brett Kavanaugh but this is what she said that I\nCannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area\nI started to feel disoriented and we're the ... and where the other boys were hanging out\nLaughing I could share them laughing and laughing\nThat's also the through because they were ... you know then Dr Ford yeah exactly\nAnd the last one Oh yes I contacted the Montgomery County police did and I also I told my mother and she cried with me she helped me the next day I was so distraught I Would I she wanted me to go to ... she was just outraged she was so hard for me\n[noise] so it would take time to get a record what they're saying is her mother has passed away the right to your original cop has passed away but there would be a record\nIt was a good place to go go find it and I'm sure she probably doesn't know the exact date the report was filed either and she may not have a copy of that as you get your own which she did name the cop best moved down to my mom was highway\nRight um yeah I mean this\nStory just like all of these witnesses a we've tried repeatedly to speak with the FBI heard nothing back even Dr Ford ... the guy or the woman were you were talking about the data judge\nThat says he confessed to this to this behavior yes I and you know again I don't know what the point you know he was or is it a certain point within his sobriety cause I I Know he he certainly tried right\nThat a because it sounded like he was remorseful when he told her\nAbout it right the
