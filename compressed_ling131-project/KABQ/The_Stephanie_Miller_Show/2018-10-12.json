a social worker more now what if if you know you can do leg your body and I I was ... that they will only half is whatever the day thing good and we turned ... family for ...\nYes yes that depends on the organization you donate to oh okay so what I Hope is for a double donation I Want to when I die if my organs or useful for somebody I Want all the organs to be harvested\nAnd yeah I ... to have when somebody to have everything in me that's useful and then whatever's left\nI Want to be donated to a medical school and then when they're done with me there they just dispose of whatever's left uh-huh and that's what I Want to have happen\nBut you know if they pass backwards laughed at my wife has to deal with ... what's left well that's fine I won't know what's happening that she'll have to deal with that but at least you know I'm a member of my nonprofit memorials society that's close to me\nAnd it'll be really inexpensive to dispose ... put it all depends on where you donate\nWhat happened with your roommates\nSo in Iraq on that China's lie to you in LA it body but you don't really know which is going to take care of\nIt except you can set up in advance and your will and make
