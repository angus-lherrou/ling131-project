a total agitation [laughter] curled up in a ball and\nYeah you treat it out\nAnd I'll show you know I'm not dividing the country by telling you which site is against you or\n... it it's crazy that they did that Trump and his supporters yelling at CNN as well like I don't get it and the people that I I I can you help me\nWhile I mean this is that was that was a response to Trump who ran all of us who who's saying you know I'm not going to let's not divide the country over the media the fight fake news they say so many mean things about me and we did were nicer to me that everybody would come together right\nAnd and this morning he just he said flat out they are the enemy of the people\nYeah I said Travis printed it out for me as well and and\nYeah I even Mike Pence is saying he's not doing it it's it's we were talking about ... terrorism which is what he's doing and he's he's inciting it not not directly but he's definitely remember like with Bill O'Reilly and as Dr ... doses [laughter]\nRight right well I mean ... you know that there but there is a way in which he\nHe's trying to instill fear in population I mean if you want to talk about terrorism is doing that I mean there is you know you're saying is just the Catholic I Would say rhetorical ... where you're where you're using language to divide people for your own purposes\nAnd I just you know he is incapable of being the president of the countries even incapable it's become part and the\nUh the the the constant attacks on Democrats the way in which he makes Democrats into the enemy\nRight I mean it's it's it's shocking\nAnd bud but in some ways the violence seems just like an inevitable out and you know out cropping from this\nRight yeah he he treated the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives in me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is they're faking dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand huh\n[laughter] well and then then again this is one of those times or where it's almost always with him that when he says something about somebody else he's actually talking about himself right you know he doesn't understand the extent to which what he's doing is dividing the country maybe he does and he just doesn't give a damn\nThat well there's that and he I mean it's it's when he has done is given permission for all of this to be out in the open\n[laughter] yeah\nYou know I mean when when was it ... you know he was a father figure to say well he gave the guy permission to do what he did\nHe did he he's he's given every bit of hate in this country some kind of cover whether it's by not you know not reacting strongly to things like Charlottesville ... I'm not immediately demanding that\nUh that there'll be some kind of investigation of anti Semitism in this country after the\nAfter Pittsburgh [noise] um you know just simply by by saying you know whatever obligatory or\nWhat ever obligatory words you can come up with like yeah yeah that was bad and we condemn it and then moving on to attacking whoever's next in his eyesight or whoever pops up on Fox and friends then uh it's it's just all be uh\nWell yeah I mean he he blaming the media for reporting what he's saying\nYeah I mean they don't even have to comment they just have to put it out there\nHow dare you say that I encourage people to a beat up protesters at the rally where I encourage hold the seat of\nProtests around exactly and you also tweeted if your response to criticism of right wing violence is you're wrong because the Pittsburgh shooter didn't like Trump because Trump doesn't hate using that you've already lost the argument you are spot on as usual\nAnd I'd get I've gotten that over and over and people will how can you say that this was about Trump because you know this guy hated Trump and it's like well yeah OK but that doesn't mean that Trump isn't doing something to make anti Semite\nYou'll feel like they have some kind of power or or that or that they have some kind of say in in in our national dialogue\nExactly I mean the fact that that he used the word nationalist when we all know what code that is an ... which is another code word on granted the shooter called Trump a global list but\nOn and it's like we know what he's talking about like like

or does he definitely has the best words um he ripped on a morning show this morning apparently a Trump and called him a quote I have to say this red quivering blob of men baby of ...\nAnd says that uh his tweets Trump's tweets and better than the original German the fruit and we have to just go [noise] it just brought up the tongue does it does is very difficult to say that now he's absolutely right he said I'm listening said they take\nThey retweet today which I'm sure sounded better in the original German and they're not taking in a sense sort of joking Trump isn't he said they take it as marching orders maybe only a tiny fraction of them but it only takes a tiny fraction and marching to a synagogue and kill eleven people and he's absolutely right\nI'll take a tiny fraction of them to like metal pipe bombs exactly to a whole people uh it's I think twelve people for ... fourteen months old people has Maxine Waters got two and Joe Biden got to a yes on and then I'll probably be also found out the ... and ...\nAnd this is the other thing with with Trump Tom Steyer yeah\nI mean literally the day after right now the Senate two days after ... sent a bon\nTrump calls him a craze and stumbling lunatic that's not helping\nAt he says he he tweeted just watched wacky Tom Steyer who I have not seen an action before being interviewed by Jake Tapper he comes off as a crazed and stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon\nWell in in Trump's defense if it's seen in would not put Tom Steyer on\nThis would have been a problem that is true you got to play to Jake ... yeah you can't put a critic of the president on right because it's it's it's because it's being to him now I understand yeah okay and and it's also the level of what ... what was that story\nI think to a bus or the problem too because they shouldn't publish the story\nThat talks about yeah because they're making a bigger than they are putting more of a spotlight on it\nOh it's about Trump's fault you just said\nYou had to defend himself oh no\nI've been doing this to all yeah I think Trump like do I don't I don't think Trump but I get the way he rationalize it you can translate Trump because that could bring Bob of maybe two men maybe he\nIs absolutely is and yet\nHere he goes oh I think I read it never mind [laughter] I I oh here we are he tweeted of anger and outrage and we're out here it comes there is a great anger in our country costs in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake\nNews media he always capitalize is that mhm title yeah the ... enemy of the people also titled must stop and open the obvious hostility and report the news accurately they are in fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage also capitalized\nAnd it's and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must and they're reporting\nRight it's only big news if it's not supporting\nTheir leader and he just he he I I uh Shaun helped me\nAnd we all say this and all sincerity but\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] deep hostilities\nAnd negative attacks you know the only served to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate okay there\nThere was no healthy debate in this country right now\nAnd he's not promoting a healthy debate because everybody is his quote enemy right\nBecause if you disagree with him your ... your credit your monster you're on the left wing mob\n... apparently yeah I don't know where am I a snowflake or am I Am\nAll he seems like a snowflake 'cause he's a very sensitive about these things he\nIs every touchy he's very touchy he ... he can't he's got the Senate he makes here are paying all that she could handle it and she's pretty ... uh and I miss her\n[laughter] you know they can do that Sarah Palin she's ... she's the reason we have him let's just say All right the total reason\nI mean Reagan I think you know thinking Reagan I think that started this ball rolling\nYeah but she she was like the first reality show candidate yeah that we've had like a dot level yeah true\nOf all [laughter]\nThey all went right back [laughter] talk right down to alter my throat [laughter]\nChoking off okay now he's just being dirty fifty eight minutes on someone else's I'm On my own fifty eight minutes we'll be right

many your races unfolding in Florida whenever there's major racism or are holding in Florida there's always political covered about the Jewish vote which is very important there are I don't know how having\nFanatical on and Trump pipe bomber in Florida there's going to help the Republican in in eight days and I don't know how Trump blaming the synagogue ... this massacre is going to help them in the places but we don't really see that covered in there and like I said\nWe're you know a Muslim attack right we we see at all it's covered about oh this is great for crop of this is all\nWell and also he didn't even comment on the kroger's shooting\nNo not even that that wasn't even nobody's really covering that which is awful because people were murdered and the guy said hey I don't kill whites don't kill each other so and he was on his way into a church on top of it all before he got into the Kroger show it's that's not even that's barely made it a whisper over the past week and that's what's also sad\nI mean we basically have the sleeper cells and they're being triggered and and\nThere's no discussion about it there's no discussion again back to the Muslim hypothetical\nI mean who radicalized people what you're you're not from Chris Rock on their Christian neighbors and hip hop on fourth and that would have been\nBut that's always the covered mhm wouldn't or any kind of Islamic terrorists or uh uh but you know we're not disgusting any of that but I mean to have the Kroger the part I'm\nUh in Pittsburgh within literally within Seventy two hour\n... ... it's almost as if you said something last week that was like a dog whistle like where he like labeled himself\nNational some sort that would inspire people to do stuff like this right\nIt is weird I mean you're looking at the timing and in finally you know kind of out themselves as a national it's oh I'm proud of it I'm proud of it who knows what triggered [noise] but I mean this is a classic this is the this is again if this were Muslim right wing Brazil's would did every headline because that's what's happening\nExactly I mean did you did you read about this delete the White House schedules to show that Trump ... cable news more than three times more than doing official work which is probably good for I'm not quite sure how to take this yeah I mean\nWe we know and he's had a light schedule though there is is this political piece out this morning ... executive time right there would be in higher\nSections of the apparently he doesn't come down into Lebanon right ah and then he has something to ah and then you know the weather is nice he's out golfing right was that this is just there and and the executive time blocks would be\nThree four hours a day now we're seeing are examples of other nine hours a day wow a ... and yet incredibly there's a there's a anonymous aide in the article called Trump a workaholic [laughter] um\nSo they'll they'll planes to any narrative but yeah I mean\nYou obviously doesn't care about the job he hasn't learned Penn thing that showed up with those reports were you cannot brief the guy in tribal cartoon as an illustration right but he's he's not going to listen for more than four minutes and it's interesting if you go back to Jonathan sport\nWho wrote art of the deal ... and was warning people about Trump in the summer of two thousand sixteen then\nA lot of the time like from trying to write that book and one of the the messages you had was Trump cannot focus and will not focused on anything for more than three minutes if the topic is not from than we're seeing that going out and the president which is very\nWell and he even um I at the rally in Illinois said that the stock market was reopened on nine twelve two thousand one\nI mean blatantly said that to his crowd and they're buying it and it does talk my and I just as the other thing it's like we're the news is reporting what he says and he's upset with I don't I I don't understand his people like us bad when we know what you just said\n[noise] ah well I mean his followers right that the right one of the sixty four thousand dollar you know do they know or they don't care that\nYou know now is so them non stop ah but yeah I mean opening I don't know what I\nYou know um but he's on track for ten thousand lives for years uh yet we've still got media outlets like the New York times\nOr which is the burning through the the stores so they don't have to call\nA Trump ally or I mean you know you have a minute those on Twitter last night Trump falsely stated you know dot dot dot I mean\nYou get to know what I mean do you does your pay get docked in the New York times if you type liar I mean it's such a weird Hilda die on but they're committed to it and that adds to the problem I mean the covered the coverage for the last I don't know three five six months\nEvery day to be the front of the United states is a pathological liar and he's a danger that says this country um but you know the press just won't make that leap\nYeah cause and words do matter a false it doesn't sound as grave as a lie\nRight sounds like someone gave him bad news information and if we can use\nIf we can just explain it to him he'll he'll know that the stock market than open on nine well\nWe need somebody who said Dick Russell told him I mean is this guy going to come out [laughter]\nRight right I mean obviously the the larger problem is the Republican Party with like the larger problem with with the with the ... I mean it is the Republican Party was groaning anti Semitic George zeros yeah rose campaign ads and they're defending it so\nYou know Trump is the problem but from getting radicalized Republican Party they wanted to be radicalized\nYeah you're absolutely right all of this stuff yeah you're absolutely he's just giving them all permission and that's\nWhy I Know and and and you know we saw this covered for like a year and a half why won't Republican you\nKnow a lot of Republicans ... Republican senators you know a pushback on Trump and you know it's kind of blindingly obvious now the reason is they don't want their you're playing with all the stuff they're they like the ... the country's biggest\nAnd and that scares me so we have eight days Eric yeah [laughter] we have eight day she tried to turn this ship back around [laughter] well I Wish I saw ... will be back next week\nYeah right we are yeah I mean look the number of look\nGood and and now all we can do is hope\nThat you know\nThere there's a message out there and that you know the press might be obsessed with from both voters but what's really\nGoing on is is something else and it's so so and\nI Hope so [laughter] you know your lips to God's Ears have a wonderful rescue your weekend\nOn my about oh we love him he makes me feel better when we need them on that when we need him on that we need every con that well we definitely do we definitely do\nWe have time for Nancy do we have time for all we do Nancy in Dallas early voting in Texas how's it going\nOr if it's been incredible um and I I actually had a friend who knew I knew how to find the names of everybody good early voted me right at the whole list of everybody voted till Saturday So I can start harassing his friends to promise and they were going to vote [laughter] you can get it you can get it on line and really\nYou just got it yeah you got to the elections county elections said early voting results and\nThey will take you to a thing it's divided by commissioner district of Dallas has a million point three voter right so it has to be kinda divvied up but\nIt is it's really a simple thing to do and I've run campaign well since the early to thousands I'm not doing that anymore but um we used to do that and we actually with a lot of people that were finally\nSay look I'm going to go\nVote so you won't call me any more I don't really work\nAnd uh it's simple to do and\nKnow if if and you can check and see if you thought of it says if you voted in person or by mail and where are you voted and what day it was tally so\nOh that's really all that's going to end and then I did you vote straight ticket do you know if people are still having those problems that people were having voted\nStraight ticket but I mean it is actually what we use here and we supposedly the crap machines but um it\nReviews the ballot for you right yet to see everything\nSo you just can't put your blind guy on it I also have friends that never vote\nStraight ticket they want to push each button for each person and in our county that saw a lot of buttons right\nNow right but I mean that's what everybody saying if it straight ticket is flipping your vocal back and just or vote one at a time\nHere fault you're forced to go back and look and\nYou make you can make changes than and we haven't writing candidates running for judge the really good woman and so I was encouraging everybody I knew 'cause you have to do that to go find her bench

Facebook apparently not that I don't know that on Facebook I don't think they really regulate at all\nBy the way what they're saying on friday about us to talk ... was that he he was he he belonged to a Facebook group those called guilt or kill George Soros mhm and Facebook had screamed that out yet you write that you'll\nWould be a something comes up in the algorithm like a trigger\nWord like you would like you would notice if the if there's like there's a group that has killing the title it's not a good thing at least look\nAt it or you might be ... it could be just the killers which is a band right on but yeah no I agree I mean he'll build fan Kill Bill saying exactly things like that but uh yeah you'd think that yeah\nIt's not a movie title is not a movie title movie time and it's not just a picture of it it's not like a screen shot it's an actual title of the Facebook group yes\nYeah you'd think that the yeah the suffering good about that yeah I'm ... apparently doesn't matter

started talking to him up all the rhetoric coming out of Donald Trump's mouth ... maybe ... or ... curtail it and he's responsible because he's got the biggest one right away ... turns as Republican same old talking point both charge do it ... is is\nHe goes ahead and happens to mention about Hillary Clinton saying something that when we go when they go low we go lower and he says he was she was referencing what a what a a cold and said about that that if they go right well you\nKnow they did that one time it took all these years for them to come up and change something like that 'cause we were pushed into saying that\nI'm surprised that elite Jackson didn't hit him with you know something when Donald Trump\nBush got into office he started in that direction moving in a rhetoric you guys said nothing now all of a sudden because Democrats say one once or twice two times because they're pushed into it no should and they're the ones that she'd be looked at this\nThis is ridiculous we are
