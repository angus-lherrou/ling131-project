discussion on the way here tonight but we're going to start with kind of some I guess some breaking news or relatively breaking\nUm apparently the s hit the fan in Portland you said Laura last weekend there was a some kind of fervor any violence or saying\nLast weekend there was a protest by antifa regarding a police shooting and the police had blocked out some streets so that in these protests but then and people went out into the streets that were not being blocked off and was harassing bystanders and blocking traffic and matter\nAnd I heard the mayor just like let it happen yeah the mayor just sort of let antifa basically around the city for a day because there's a there's a law on the books in pretty much every place called disorderly conduct and I am a big critic of this law generally because it's written so vaguely so nebulous to where\nIf the cops just don't like you can essentially charged with disorderly conduct and usually they'll get a conviction the way that these things at the very least in New Hampshire are written I'm sure it's very similar in in other places but there is at least one part of disorderly conduct it makes sense\nAnd that is the idea of if you're blocking traffic\nYou are committing disorderly conduct your you know getting the way of other people trying to go about whatever business they have or whatever pleasure they have they're trying to go from point a to point B and you've decided you're going to block that off well that makes sense to make that an actual like\nPunishable thing should it be standing in the road\nBlocking traffic and this I say is somebody who has a long history of doing protest actions I mean I've been in the streets\nBut I don't stand in the road I'm On the side of the road you know I'm a not blocking traffic I Want people who are on the road to actually want to read the sign that I that I have\nBecause like I if I were to stand in front of them [laughter] and they would be so angry that they would absolutely hate whatever it is what even if my ideas where the greatest ideas ever they were completely reject them out of hand because the way I was presenting them\nOr was it about as rude is you could possibly\nGet and they win a lot further than simply blocking traffic they were telling you things they were telling people which way to turn and one man turns right when they didn't want him to turn right so they chased him down the street he stepped out to try to talk to them it was an elderly man and they punched him in the face\nWhile it was pretty violent\nAnd and so now

one and nine hundred and Ninety nine\nAlright so uh we started out here talking about briefly the story from Oregon live dot com\nAbout a brawl that apparently broke out during a protest or march of some sort called a law and order march so I presume that's the right wing or is it coming back because it was last weekend when apparently\nPeople on the left the antifa group blocked off traffic in Portland and made a big to do and people got delayed and probably got pretty angry about that was there are also violence that erupted in Portland or was it they pretty much just block traffic and then went away after a while\nThey were they were isolated spots of violence like the one that I described where they the punch the men in the face but I don't think there are any type of may lay or brawl you know exactly but there were angry mobs running after people and\nApparently there was a brawl the statement here from the uh let's see organ live is that it lasted more than ... minutes and it looks like according to the video footage that I'm looking at here there\nAre a couple of side squaring off or against one another maybe OK yeah there's several I Would say a few dozen people that are that are fighting in this\nIn this case and they're sort of in the streets and running across the street and\nAnd this is from last night yeah this is ... or late last night in Portland the Portland police bureau reported seeing protests and counter protest participants outfitted with hard nickel gloves knives and firearms earlier in the evening but they did not make any arrests at this point the wild scene unfolded amid mounting tensions among both groups\nFueled in part by pair of national news stories says it a march against police brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which is the one that you're talking about\nAh which outraged many including patriot prayer leader Joey Gibson and his supporters on friday a viral video surfaced showing members of the Proud Boys are right wing fraternal organization beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at the Republican Party headquarters\nIt was against this backdrop that Gibson who count the number of Proud Boys among his ranks organized the so called flash march for law and order and pediatrics ostensibly to protest Portland mayor Ted Wheeler and his oversight of the city's police force\nWaiving American flags and breaking into patriotic chance Gibson and several dozen supporters sent off or set off to a street memorial for Patrick Kevin's uh twenty seven year old black man shot and killed by police an incident that prompted last week's march\nUh they is they arrived at the vigil on south west fourth avenue and Harvey Milk street they were met by a large group of counter demonstrators chanting black lives matter the two sides exchanged Thompson threats police stood by and warned against physical confrontation\nBut about twenty minutes later the violence erupted a few blocks away among a smaller group of participants and so that's kind of the story there so apparently you've got the right wing group ah this ah what was the Patriot prayer prayer\nWhich is not the same thing as the Proud Boys but there's a mixing between the two and then you've got the other group that was protesting police violence and so patriot prayer made an appearance at the protest against police violence and then\nThings escalated apparently at that point although it doesn't sound like they escalated very long it doesn't know article makes it sound like that Portland just erupted into violated I was curious I find that a lie and say oh it's about sixty seconds\nDoes it did happen and that is significant that depressed it's almost like the press wants it to how he asks course they do because it sells them whatever people are going to tune in oh there tonight at eleven you know see the footage\nSo depressed definitely wants to see violence happen this means a lot to them but uh I don't support violence I don't think violence is uh is the solution it's unfortunate to see people feeling like that's all they have left 'cause usually that sort of what happens is you know people uh they did get upset about something and they feel like the other\nBecause it was different because they attacked an innocent bystander whereas last an elderly man like last week\nThis week it was real protest fighting in in the streets\nRight but when there's somebody going to ask the question why is that the left the burning down cities are attacking innocent people and then when the right goes and they want to have a protest the left shows up and causes trouble with the\nWell to be fair he's a ... to leave their protesters\nThe police guys were not protesting last week when the anti police guys were there they stayed home and let them have their day right then and then this week the police guys are out there protesting and then a bunch of anti police guys show up and surprise\nThat's another way it was or at least that's not the way the story was told in the news now the news media gets it wrong though let's take that with a grain of salt but the story was that the\n... the story was that the right wing protesters came to where the anti police or the police whatever police accountability protesters were so they the right wing has brought there for the law and order people brought their protest to where the other protest was happening but regardless\nThat's fine if you want to bring a protest to counter protest I don't think you should let someone have their day if somebody is out there with a message\nThat you don't want other people to hear or you want it you want them to the very least here the other side of it it's entirely appropriate for you to go out there with counter protest signs and peacefully counter protests so the question really becomes\nWho was it that started his violence because ultimately things are generally peaceful with protesters and counter protesters until somebody\nYou know throws a punch or until somebody does something to instigate others into violence now but I'm not excusing you know people who escalate the situation because it likely came from both sides you know because when somebody throws a punch the appropriate thing to do is to you know\nRestrict the ... the fight from going further hold both of the participants back stop them from fighting and you know try to break it up in this case so everything has to related auto on both sides but I think one of the things you'll find out is frequently even if it's you know even if you can point to oh it was one of them it was the left ear it was the righty\nSometimes it's actually an undercover police officer who is an agent provocateurs tour that has come in there for the purpose of causing a fight and so it's really hard in some cases to figure out who it is a that's responsible for\nThese have they been incidence of that happening 'cause I'm Out oh yeah I got to say I'm skeptical young\nAdult loosely have yeah I don't know if that was the case it last night uh but there are definitely times when a not only have the police been caught red red handed\nA with undercover officers you know again masquerading as though they're on the protesters' side they do something like throw a you know throw a bottle or do something to kind of escalate us a tense situation with the hope\nThat the fight will break out so the police then have the excuse to come in and use you know violence against the protestors\nBecause the cops get off on using violence a lot of them do they're excited about this you may remember years ago we reported on I think it was the Democratic National Committee\nThey actually had cops who are wearing shirts it was like police union shirts with this sort of global ring ugly cop on the front holding a like a trench in smacking it against his hand might stick or something like that just the image on the shirt\nAnd it says we get up early to beat the crowds\nThat wearing terrorists that said that so dark humor that is kind of funny\nIt's funny but it's completely inappropriate for ... a professional a police force to be wearing a T shirts like that and you know tip their hand ... and say yeah we want to beat you were violent [laughter] but it's still funny [laughter] oh it sounds that are funnier hilarious\n[laughter] any comments and the other things you wanna share tonight about the protests\nWell it was just those are some questions that immediately sprung to my mind as soon as I heard you guys talking about it 'cause tonight listening to you are my drug store\nAnd it just ... you know when you see a cheap party protests and they clean up the national mall as there as opposed to an end cheaper protest where they burned out happier city\nYou know why do people never asked this question [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean it's certainly inappropriate to leave a mess in a place in which you've you've occupied for for a period of time but it's certainly not a you know all people on the left maybe the antifa are particularly messy but you know I've been to him all\nThe ... but the whole Occupy Wall street people hey we're going to show up without a permit and we're just going to take\nOver healthier tile and he shouldn't have to get a permit to protest I mean I agree with you you either you know you\nI agree with you but if you're going to charge the part of the in order to have a big public event and forest but the party to provide for or to parties and security and all that kind of stuff\nAnd that's what happened on you ask for our mission so here I probably if you're putting together a protest Brian and you ask for permission than the government's going to come back\nWith a set of rules that they want you to follow whereas if you are what is our right if you gather in a public place which is that right you know that his supposedly protected under the Constitution's bill of rights then\nYou don't need a permit and if you don't ask for a permanent then they can't require you to bring port a potties or anything like that so that's what happens when you ask a question\nThat's probably the difference between a rally in our protest\nWell know either way you're asking for permission I Will never ask a government bureaucrats permission to exercise my rights because the moment you do that you've converted your right into a privilege and as a voting rights as I got I Love your\nGuy forever either I appreciate it it's the truth and no matter whether you're a political perspective is I look at it a little differently I look at it\nAs notice and as you are but that's different than asking the casual air if they deny your request than I Would go to court or including me out is you can\nRequest asking your in treating your begging you're asking for permission if I'm applying for permanent damage to the new it as I'm giving them notice so they can prepare and if they deny it we're going to go to court because I Do have the right to protest his disease that\nSure but you but you've lost from the beginning right because you you're applying which is to suggest that ... that you think they have an appropriate level of control over this property that you have to ask them for permission even though you're saying it's you're right you're subverting that by asking for permission and the first place\nIt's one thing to say give notice getting noticed would be to send an noticed too that department at the department of parks and rec or whatever saying\nJust to let you know we're going to be here on this day in this time here's your notice this isn't you know that's not asking for permission you're not filling out a form you know giving them money\nAnd you're not going to agree to whatever terms they want you to agree to\nNow in some cities that's going to bring you more trouble than you know it might be worse but regardless then if you want to have a law suit\nYou can also see when they arrest you illegally for you know gathering in ... which is you're right it doesn't want I Want to make is that you may see it as noticed but they don't they don't ask direct there and that's an application and you know that has a very specific legal meaning you're applying you're asking your begging you are in treating\nBrian great call thank you for the call tonight I appreciate hearing from you we can continue though and you can bring up whatever's on your mind whether it's these protests the the the supposed a civil war is that really on the horizon or has it already started\nAnd I sort of the eyes proceed fine lines in

I mean it's definitely ready to blow smoke on somebody's that's what you're saying if you're saying they blew it close to ... you\nKnow but to be at the ... if you recall that it and you're right about something they weren't going it correctly I put\nOff but I just had a way way odor yeah having to get away with the odor\nSo yeah um I you know when you're out on the streets in a city um there are unpleasant owners that are present I don't know if you've ever been to New York there was another sales are down there is that for a while now hold on you made you pointed out going to respond to it as ... and the smell of garbage on a New York city streets and let me tell you I find that quite unpleasant\nBut it is what it is and sometimes the smell of urine from some bomb having Pete over on the side of a building or something like that that's pretty gross um sometimes maybe it's a lady who's put way too much perfume on she's walking by me I don't really care to to smell those things\nBut these are the things that happened when you're out in public places where we have tragedy of the comments which is to say that these are places that are either\nYou know they're they're not owned by anybody there the government public property and so therefore nobody's really in charge of it and everybody kind of has to be allowed there which means you're going to encounter some stinky people uh you know who knows what those smells are going to be I don't think you would advocate that people should be banned from smoking cigarettes outdoors would you\nLike those either to be quite Frank and\nSuddenly I was like something doesn't mean it should be banned does it\nI'm not suggesting that control whether it get banned or not the only way I intro that is by voting at the ballot box where the issue that I Want to your boat or ... and then I don't want to vote for and I wish the whole the whole country would decide that they take it to the ballot box than just\nYour eye out you're putting down and you're missing my point you know my point here you are saying if you go to the ballot box and you vote for somebody that says I'm going to ban smoking outdoors because some people don't like the smell it could be dangerous it's for the children or whatever rules you know reasons they\nUh they're talking about you are voting for that level of control against your neighbors and you shouldn't be upset when your neighbors do the exact same thing to you that's the thing you're putting it out there into the universe so to speak that it's okay\nTo control your neighbors so guess what you're going to end up being the one who's controlled every time I didn't\nI didn't say at all I was that bad I I think it's great that we have to decide the quite the same reason I could listen your\nWeight I thought you were upset about the smoke in the streets\nNo but that when if marijuana smoke because that's not the same thing as a cigarette smoke they both get their damage but one day

public street and happening to smell a whiff of marijuana ...\nGreat but it's the point of no I agree but the point of it is that it could very well happen when to\nYour input in happen it really

this I tell you that if people want to go to the ballot box out here in Missouri and in the Midwest when you get away from the city we get a more practical person it like you get a guy is actually\nWorking there not unemployed they're not doing all the things that are protesting because they don't have anything else to do and that's everybody but there is a first said it it is and you

I think that really but the uh\nThe\nSecond Amendment is there are right and I think there's a a\nOh there's definitely\nI mean this is just protect the different there's laws we have like driving out her right\nWell let me ask you are right let me ask you this are as their rights that are enumerated in the constitution the only writes we have\nNo no they're not\nGoing to have you on a three way out who ah have you heard of the rights of property\nAnd the right to pursue happiness\nYeah okay those are and what you're going to dashing right what's that\nThose are in the constitution right you're right to pursue happiness\nYour right to ... your right to contract\nThat's right right so therefore\nAlong with the second amendment which protects your right to defend yourself all of those rights are ostensibly protected and numerous enumerated to some extent in the constitution if it is my pursuit of happiness to have the property that I Want to say let's say marijuana or then shouldn't that be my unassailable right\nLet me let me jump in just for a second I gotta see in common law um\nA cousin who spent a lot of um pursuit of happiness has met declaration of independence is that in the other side of\nWhatever declaration of independence yeah but they didn't matter rather I like both outlined in two of the most important documents in it is very young American principle from our founding fathers\nThe right to pursue that you know I I mean I haven't gotten there too right sorry go ahead ...\nNo no problem but there's just a minute later this year I there's definitely throw letter not just something that there's been a year or so but even in high school you remember the idea that get tripping on acid running down the road\nOr in the clouds are chasing them then they become ... and I'm not talking about the issue of marijuana as bad as a something that should be legalized but okay they're\nYou just took ten times the dose that you were expecting to take because you didn't know any better because it's not us it's not a product you're buying off the shelf where you know exactly how many milligrams are in the pill\nYou have no idea what it's been cut with you have no idea how many hands that has passed so we want it to be regulated oh God no [laughter] no worse not um what what you want if you're a liberal minded person is for the market to self regulate so\nThe reason we have you know if you go into Walgreens or you know your local drugstore and you buy aspirin off the shelf\nThe reason why you're you can be short it's really aspirin in the bottle\nIs because of the market place it's not because the FDA's out they're keeping you safe from Beyer or Advil or whatever it is because they're an Advil or the generic drug manufactures\nWant you to have a product that you can count on that you know what it is if they just randomly soldiers some crap that you didn't know what it is as aspirin you probably wouldn't be a very happy customer if you survived the experience\nAnd you might want to let your you know friends and family know to not shop at Walgreens 'cause they're selling a you know something killer that something is going to hurt you or instead of the aspirin so I mean the market has all the controls that are necessary to make sure\nThat people can stay safe because of competition because we can critique and we can protest and we can boycott\nAnd we can spread the word about bad actors in the marketplace whereas when you have government regulators in the picture\nAll they really do is add costs are too manufacturing and research I which is one of the reasons why pills are so expensive you know prescription medications are so expensive because they have to go through billions of dollars worth of a FDA mandates that in a lot of cases ended up keeping useful drugs off the market\nUm rather than actually allowing them in and frequently the FDA and other regulatory boards whether it be the FDA or\nYou know the health inspectors in the restaurant association or whatever they end up being staffed by the very same people that they're regulating so a lot of cases called regulatory capture where and a lot of cases you know some executives CEO of Pfizer just retired well guess what he now shows up on the you know the board at the FDA\nAnd so of course he's gonna protect his buddies and industry for many upstarts or any newbies are you know smaller companies that don't have the billions of dollars they need to get through the regulatory process I tend to play\nThe devil's advocate and you read it that you start to run into problems when everybody in the industry is doing the same thing when they're all playing the same game and then the competition doesn't work to give an example when I spent a summer in Bolivia with a family there and they weighed am\nFire up there still Wes gas that they would buy in a tank and\nEverybody who sold the gas would add water to the ... and you never knew how much gas was actually in their cars you can't tell by feeling way yeah and you couldn't just protests them because they all get it to the competition wasn't working don't need the government to step\nIn no you wouldn't need the government to step in because that's the market opportunity that's a signal to people in the markets saying hey there's money to be made here if you can offer product a that is a better product at a similar price then you could take some of the business from the people that are watering down\nA their product but then there's a reason why that's not happening well maybe there is a reason why I don't know what are the entire regulatory system is like over there it's likely that you are it is likely regulated industry already would be my guess if you're talking about a hazardous material or to potentially explosive material there is a good chance there's already some regulatory body\nI don't know how to regulate announced they would have on that but I Do know that they're going to have a lot more corruption than you would normally have it in other places\nAt least that you would like to think that you would normally have the right places the corruption here tends to be less in your face but it's very much present right so you can pay a bribe to a cop in another country pretty easily from what I hear a buzz around here you can't just pay the cop directly ... arrest you for that\nBut it's still the same process ultimately you know whether you're paying the cop directly a bribe or you pay the fee to a courtroom later on down the line after you've gone to trial\nYou're still paying money into the group of government gangsters that are ruling over your life to tie back around to the discussion we're having earlier but let's go back to your phone calls and thoughts here we've got Steve he's in Detroit Steve you're on TALK live at the end Laurel in my case\nExpect Michael guys thanks you want to take it back on the on\nThe guy that just called about the drugs um I I think there are some drugs that\nI'm On like the drugs that you got to talking about here cause people to become extremely violent\nI mean in a way where they have they controlled like alcohol um\nNo I don't know I've been married for Twenty one year yeah and I've never seen that drug ... in some areas of the country they call it black\nUh up here and then they call it like to er spice\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah the ... I Try to buy temperatures like are you\nMarried yeah\nThese are synthetic drugs or the ... when you say this type of drug it's actually you're over simplifying as you probably know a lot of these drugs are very different um there are a\nConglomerate of a lot of different drugs that correct\nRight there but I Do to come\nOut of it but there's a lot different chemicals and um and I think they come from China but I've never yet in the body react the way I think as a medic for Twenty one years I can feel it drunks all day long academic ... we can fix that\nBut people that are on these drugs synthetic drugs and I'm not sure what their compound is but the violent level that hey if you don't work out um I've seen them actually\nHolds haters out and and they become extremely violent I made violent point where we can't we can't go after the law enforcement actually there are some there was\nNothing really works\nThe cradle today and that what you're talking about I've seen I've seen a I Know what you're talking about I've seen this uh when I was in jail for civil disobedience there was a guy who came in who was on some of this stuff and it was insane what when he was doing I won't get\nYou know into detail on that but my point that I wanted to make on this is yeah some of these are pretty scary a these are experimental chemicals that don't have a whole lot of history I mean we've got decades of experience behind you know the use of things like LSD or MBNA some of the more traditional illegal drugs these are new relatively new within the last decade or two\nAnd a more popular within the last decade and the reason why these synthetic drugs exist is because of drug prohibition\nSo because drugs have been prohibited well what you had happened was these Chinese companies or or whoever it is but some of them definitely come from China\nThey manufacture these I think the chemical analogs is is the term they they're very very similar chemical structure to say a THC or to MBNA or to whatever it is they're trying to eight\nBut they changed the structure slightly to where it's not the legal one oh they only made it his chemical structure illegal so this slightly tweaked modified one isn't the one that's illegal so then they can manufacture that\nAnd they spray it on some urban they put it into to ... to er spice or whatever the name of the moment and so ultimately the reason why those things were produced is because people couldn't get the real thing they there was a great with you on that one because I I only because it's illegal people thought that he was going to ask your right people don't stop using it that's true\nHowever there is a certain group of people out there who would rather by the legal version of the thing because they feel safer if they're buying a legal version but the fact is there in greater danger because we don't know what these things do long term Steve thanks for the call more can\nLet's talk up let's talk about down home values fade into USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid I remember\nMoved\n\nInto the way they\nVoted down in the crowd\nWhere you need in\n\nNoodle fashion comfort dime a dozen genes every stitch guarantee in order to vendor motorcycle gene guns Kevlar reinforced see them a G.

F. if I got this righty drop them F\nRight there with Benedict Donald there I did this this is restoring dignity to the White House right we've got ... out there doing what Milan is done right we've got Kanye invited to the White House jacking up McDonald's sales I guess Jack in the box in McDonalds\nAnd and and so is this restoring dignity to the White House with with ... dropping really really nasty cuss words right like right there and and and you know and bombs and all this kinda stuff [noise]\nSo anyway I don't think we have restored dignity to the White House I'm just going to go on a limb there and say we we have not restored dignity or to the White House\nBut if there was going to be justice if there was going to be justice in this world and Taylor Swift should have run on to the White House grounds grabbed that microphone out of Conyers' hand and say you know beyond see should be here today in not you [noise] and then ... had to cry because he made her cry\nYou see I'm learning all the pop culture stuff missiles or ten years ago is that I'm just learning it now anyway\nI'm catching up I'm Pamela flow but any way that he made her cry it turns out I didn't know he ran up on the state's calling us I don't know if you're a you know I'm sure you know this much better than I Do kind of run up and say some award show grab my phone's beyond the should have won the award and Taylor Swift cried\nAnd I mean that's not nice so that's not a nice thing to do right I tell you all do it not a nice thing to do that and\nI think they're doing you are so I just I\nI I just I feel better if your feelings are important it's important to be in touch with your feelings and so watching this practical at the White House and going back in my memory banks saying I seem to remember these people saying oh that White Houses so undignified now we've got to restore dignity and just\nJust opposing ... is a good word for it that's where the G\nYou said the best words juxtaposition\nCompare and contrast right I I don't think we're restoring dignity to the White House\nAnd so I'm going to leave that there because there are much more important things we've got to discuss for example senior legal analysts time is in the next hour\nAnd I want to thank everybody for the emails to norm at Norman Goldman dot com because this topic that we're going to do a senior legal analyst on at the beginning of the next hour\nNorman Norman Goldman dot com was very instrumental in getting me to do this\nI don't know if you saw it in the news but\nA whole lot of complaints judicial complaints have been filed against Brett Kavanaugh about his conduct his performance there at the what the Senate\nIf I get my opinion of it I think it was fair\nTo sell a lot of people were not impressed with his performance in the Senate so they've launched judicial complaints and gifts you can\nHowever I Know the real question everybody's asking is can we get them off the bench with this and the answer is no constitution says how you get a judge off the bench\nHowever I've gone and what we can't keep thinking that we can use these process these that were never designed for what we want to re purpose them for now to re purpose him just as we want to get to a result it doesn't work that way anyway\nSenior legal analysts time at the beginning of the next hour a group of

you know the tree goes right into the White House when this case the intrigue really does go right into the White House so you have to understand the way Saudi Arabia is they claim it's a kingdom right there's a royal family well there's been a lot of turmoil in the family lately and\nThe current state of affairs appears to be this one guy like thirty three years old they call him M. B. S. because his name is Mohammed bin Salman he's the crown prince in other words he is their version of Jared Kushner [noise]\nSo basically and and by the way he and Jared Kushner had become really really good bugs oh they're they're so close they're they're like blood brothers by now\nSo Jared Kushner and\nNBS Mohammed bin Salman\nAre really really close and\nI Can't imagine a world where Jared Kushner and Benedict Arnold would not be aware that MBBS was about to assassinate one of his own citizens on foreign so they had to know they had to know\nAnd they had to have given the green light that said don't worry about it were cool can you imagine if block Obama were still president an MBA as ... hey I'm going to go do this thing I Know he's living in America now and he's a contributor the Washington Post and all but I'm going to just go kill them in the council it and and use a bone sort of had\nThem up and and make them disappear that's okay with you isn't that Mr Obama you're good that President Obama and that's why President Obama would say you know\nI think maybe we need to have some more meetings with Iran that would help\nSaudi Arabia of course is the mortal enemy of Iran and vice versa they are the two big heavy weights in the middle east they're combating it out and so the way to make a Saudi Arabia upset\nIs too cozy up to Iran and the way to make a rod said is the cozy up Saudi Arabia and of course everybody plays games but Benedict I'm of course not playing that game what Benedict oh there was they kill the guy\nAnd the reason bent and now of course I by the way I have to confess I don't have facts to back this up but Benedict Arnold has been selling our government and basically privatizing it and essentially selling you know going to Russia China wherever saying\nHey what do I get for this and we're you know they get they monetize so\nThe United Arab Emirates to scientists figured out that the way to Benedict Donald hardest through his wallet and through his son in law's wallet\nAnd so this is the kind of corruption going on here we now have we now have a sitting United States senator a Republican a well respected foreign policy Republican ...\nProbably murder\nOn the other half of\nA yeah that's Bob Corker he's retiring Tennessee Republican he's on the foreign if it's chair the foreign affairs to me he's a foreigner Adele just kinda guy foreign affairs guy and so when he saying I think he's probably been murdered that's a pretty significant statement although you know I\nHope he turns up somewhere that was his last night anyway\nThis is the voice of corruption because Benedict Donald is compromised because he's in the piece in the pocket he's on the payroll of the Saudi royal family he and his no good son is good for another son in law they're not going to do anything about this but they have to say some words\nI think there are other ways if it turns out to be as bad as it might be there are certainly other ways of handling the situation but I Will tell you up for us right now and I'll say there for the senators [noise]\nThey're spending a hundred and ten billion dollars purchasing military equipment and other things uh if we don't sell it to them they'll say well thank you very much will buy from Russia or thank you very much will buy it from China that doesn't help us not when it comes to jobs and not when it comes to our company's losing out on our\n... year will keep selling them arms one of the hundred and ten billion why let a big chunk of business get in a way of a little murder\nAnyway at least these open an obvious about one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one when I did this topic yesterday at the beginning of the third hour on the phone went crazy and people who knew a lot of the details you or knew a lot more than me called in let's see what's going on and by the way and a half\nHour one half hour exactly from right now we have senior legal analyst time it's all those complaints that were lodged against Brett Kavanaugh that the chief justice these so called quote unquote chief justice John Roberts ah he works for them to the tenth circuit court of appeal what is it all about what's going to happen what can\nHappen what can happen will get it all than one half hour but it's you and me right now and to receive getting started in Washington state I Theresa\nOh hi norm how you doing I'm swell what's up good\nGood hey I'm a little off topic um I didn't quite catch the whole the whole thing on the Saudis that\nI'm going to get married at quite All

the idea of federalism is to keep government as much government as opposed to the people as possible that's why the states are really important and then inside the states your local town your village your community your city\nAlso has power over you the ideas the smaller and smaller the group that has power over you the more and more you have a chance in a democracy to have an impact on your the governance of your own life so I get to deal with the Los Angeles city council in my city councilmember over the quality the streets in the city of Los Angeles I don't have to go to Washington for that\nI don't have to Benedict Donald about the streets in Los Angeles it's a local issue the reason it's a local issues because of a federalist system of government that's blitz responsibility for various things amongst the different layers the federal government handles international fares\nBankruptcy see a uniform bankruptcy laws across the country to facilitate business so\nAs natural incidence of federalism each state is its own kind of like a mini nation in many ways it can't really have an army can't negotiate international treaties that's been given to the federal government but the state still have tremendous power within their own state borders and\nFor example in Kansas yeah\nThat state Kansas a few years ago\nThe state Supreme Court got into a big fight with the governor then governor Sam Brownback and the legislature because the Kansas City state Supreme Court said under our Kansas State constitution they're off formulas for funding public schools and you cheap skate Republicans\nAre not funding the schools to the minimum required by the state constitution so you've got to do it and they had a big in ...\nKansas State constitutional crisis where the governor was an open to find some of the Supreme Court and the legislature saying we'll work it out and everybody's trying to make deals and everybody's posturing\nThat was all in the state of Kansas because the state Supreme Court said under their state constitution they're public education system was screwy and that to fix it\nIn Pennsylvania just a couple of months ago the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court said\nUnder the state constitution that the district lines with Congress were written illegally because they were gerrymandered and therefore they had to be rewritten because the legislature wouldn't do it to court when did it themselves and all that went to the U.S Supreme Court and us record so we don't have any jurisdiction here that the states that the state issue\nState constitution state Supreme Court state laws inside the states boundaries\nAnd so when a Republican talk show host is\nGetting upset because exactly the stuff that they say they love doesn't hurt to their resulting advantage they get mad that just exposes the ridiculous is of their views because all they're doing is they're creating ridiculous theories\nThat they think will likely get them to the outcomes that they want and when they get home based on their own pet tarred when their own thing boomerang back on them and exposes them because they lose on the issue then they get mad and yell and scream and tribal everybody into submission and Paul that game got and\nWell okay so what he's hoping is and the cat that somehow the United States Supreme court and actually do a little too okay so we talked about the United States Supreme court will step in and say\nWashington state Supreme Court you have to abide by what the legislature says because he's saying if you can't get it through the legislature the court has no was doing this I don't know the court first of all our our Supreme Court is going to what the body as much as the legislature is and the ... and the United States Supreme court has no business\nIn any capital case that has to do with a state law\nThey kept talking about they have nothing to do with it but what the what they're hoping is that your short that while they're in power they will use the Supreme Court to only the Democrats states into and\nThat when they're not in the Supreme Court said Dr states rights days right so they're going to play both sides of the coin him\nThe case that he went into is that a I'm a Washington state capital murder case went to the Supreme Court and he said and the court heard the facts of the cave and said no he doesn't deserve the death penalty and I don't even have to know the case going to know that no matter who the facts of the case because the Supreme Court does not fight fracking murder cases\nAll those and I said okay\nNothing wrong with the the screaming along with the judge of the as long as the fate to ally faces presented that Supreme Court just upsets me was that good at it but what happened right Supreme\nCourts don't do trials spree oh it's as frightened for reports I don't do trials they don't find facts\nThey accept the fact that were found in the courts beneath them they way the law they say was the jury instruction a proper statement of the law did this jury instruction mislead the jury and would there be a different result if the law were told to them differently that's the job of state Supreme Court's not to weigh facts and say people deserve it or not\nPaul here's the problem here's the problem you are taking them at\nTheir word that they are principled people they are not

I'm Sorry to be the bearer of bad news the judicial council cannot kicking a federal judge has already been confirmed by the Senate has to be nominated by president the only way to do with his impeachment announced removal by the scent short of kicking them off the bench what they can do is put a form of censure out there\nIn extreme cases if it's like a district court judge that they can just simply stop assigning cases to the judge and there's a procedure in the long to get a new judge the Congress will approve a new judge and so you can get you basically have a sitting judge or not doing a whole lot\nYou know that's a rare case and that's a very rare case but basically most instances they just dismiss the complaint and even when they find the complain has merit there's no way they can kick the judge off so you know basically if the bankruptcy judging kick the bankruptcy judge dropped as a bankruptcy judge is not article three judges\nBut they can or judge to retire they can wave the rules and kind of help a judge to retire there are ways to deal with this without\nKicking the judge off the bench and so the remedy for all of these complaints against Brett Kavanaugh\nA letter center at most I Would think and I'm not sure even that because now he's sitting Supreme Court judge\nAnd I got one more in this kind of said punch line which is when the chief justice of the United states the so called illegitimate chief justice of the ... the United states I got to get used to say that now thanks Brett and Neal anyway or when he decided to send this for investigation\nHe said that to the tenth circuit which is in Denver and the judge and he sent it to is that George W.
