{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "The anthology seat present UFOs an eighty presence and then has to do with\nAngel hair or something that looks like almost like a cop Web as if these\nCraft our ej acting something out of the craft I talked to me about a angel hair this goes back to the the Nineteen fifties it seemed to be that seem to be kind of a hot period for for this discussion on angel here because we don't hear an awful lot of boating now\nAre we certainly don't and it seems that ah you followed it goes through waves of things are which is quite interesting and it of itself with different characteristics are holding forth for a while and then morphing into something else\nUh this article was done by re Palmer who was one of the co founders were Curtis for of a fate magazine\nAnd the angel hair um\nIs is kind of a wispy white substance that um that has been or was found on the ground for example after there'd been a UFO activity\nUm some of it was even collected and chemically analyze that in one case\nUm Palmer talks about um an analysis that showed the substance to be organic\nAnd then it could be dissolved and hide ... acid and that had had inflammable a characteristics as well\nAnd um there were speculations that well this wasn't really coming from UFO as it was probably the the the bunker and a skeptic side of it um it was a kind of like silky\nKinds of threads that we find the milkweed that floats around cotton wood um and things like that but this um angel hair or was it commonly reported characteristic for some years and then just kind of\nI'm literally vanish I mean we rarely hear about angel hair any anymore and uh his speculation was our our UFOs injecting something from right wrapped could this be like perhaps waste\nThat they they might dispel into the atmosphere [noise] um it was also\nThe trials I'm oh I'm Sorry if you also made a suggestion that it could be like a chef which is sometimes ejected by fighter planes during World War two it was used in other in other areas to confuse radar that's\nRight yes and maybe it would have that property as well um there were some descriptions of it as more phone like rather than silky thread that there seem to be some variations in these substances [noise]\nAh and I'm a there was one case from I'm Nineteen fifty seven uh where this form like substance a was actually touched and that it had kind of a numbing effect\nAnd nobody ever was able to ascertain exactly what I'm this angel hair a range of substances\nOh exactly what they exactly were and what their purpose was and I did like the explanation about 'em in the ah the radar um something to confuse radar that uh our own terrestrial crap to use\nAnd that um who knows maybe the alien craft we're trying to throw us off their trail with the injection of angel hair\nBut then that raises the question uh if it was some sort of effective thing for a aliens to uh to eject back then what changes occurred that it rarely happens anymore\nWell that was sixty years ago or I mean no one knows what will we evolve perhaps so so to have they maybe there are technologies just better now they don't need that any more\nWell it could be and I also think it's because\nWe've made some shift in consciousness and there has been more of an inquiry now on the nature of human consciousness and the fact that these experiences may take place in alternate realities they're not physical experiences on earth\nAre in three D. reality but I'm a lot of these contact experiences and sightings I'm involved

the killing\nThe night was shaping up to be a quiet one so when my service or when my service radio interrupted oppressed paw so I could listen my partner and the next zone over where the river's still flowed said he had signed the lingo for footprints for a group of two or three\nThe fields where money making it hard to tell the exact number I sped off and took the first wrote east assuming it would be heading toward town by the time I got there too had been caught but there was a sign for one more\nIran along an era grace irrigation channeling all lettuce field flashlight and hand my ... a boot screw heavy with mud quickly I found some tracks that look promising\nI followed them east before they crossed over a month and then turned back toward the river I began to jog while I kept my uh kept my light on the tracks up ahead I saw a dark keep on the ground I adrenalin spiked as I step closer\nAs I shouted commands and clumsy gringos Spanish the mass which I could see was wearing ... work boots finally lifted his hands from the ground I grabbed his shoulders and pulled them up to his knees keeping a close eye on his hands something was off\nFor the size of this guy he was two lights as I helped him up to his feet and turned him toward me it made sense the face of an old man look back at me full of deep lines he wore a puffy jacket which filled out his Lynn frame\nI began to my usual questions about his place of birth citizenship and such before I got to far he interrupted and told me not to bother with Spanish he lived in the United states for almost Thirty years and he spoke English my line of questioning shifted where why how you came for work\nAnd had a job lined up in a tire shop he'd gone to Mexico to visit his aging mother and was on his way back said he was surprised when we caught him because he used to cross your often I walked in back to my truck padded them down for weapons in loaded in in the cage in the back according to the law he was a criminal\nAnd never followed up on what happened to the old man but it was predictable nearly all migrants we caught would spend some time in jail see a judge and then get sent back to Mexico this tended to be a cyclical story the old man would probably try to cross again somewhere else\nFirst timers usually say they're going to do it the right way next time until you tell them they're banned from even applying for a visa for five years after the second time\nIt's Twenty years\nThis was one of the first policy details that didn't sit well with me if we're actually concerned with people entering legally than wide ban them from doing so\nBecause it's all about compliance it's not about anything else that is all about compliance\nBut his he's saying here you can't even try to comply so the point being\nWell you didn't comply this one time now you can't even tried to comply again for five more years oh we talked to a second time now you can't even try to comply for twenty more years\nAt the border control is more about the controls in the border\nIt it just controlling people they're here to begin with because what the us dead and Central America over the last\nHundred and fifty years of war on drugs that's not a hundred well no I mean in the last ... before the war either before the war on drugs there's all the various us back to and other military interventions in Central America we created a situation that is sending\nA migrants out of the country trying to find a safer place to raise their children\nThe Mexican American War that wound up shifting the border of Mexico from what is now northern California Colorado Utah\nDown to the current border south of Arizona south of New Mexico south of taxes like all of that all of the desert southwest used to be in Mexico\nAnd and that right yeah so so as a libertarian of course I'm for open borders like most libertarians but even if you don't take that as a given the free movement of peoples libertarian\nSomething that people should consider is part of the whole American history and miss those an ideology is this concept of manifest destiny we were destined to take over this entire middle swath of North America and if you're going to have a country that's going to see is that large as a portion of the earth\nI think you kinda have a moral obligation to taking a proportional number of people you can't just say like oh well this is ours and nobody else in common\nAnd it's like a lot of these people are more genetically related to the people who were here before then the people running the United states now it's like the board across them they didn't cross the border they were part of you know ethnic groups and cultural groups that migrated you know through areas that are now the United states\nAnd we're trying to say like nope this is ours and even though your ancestors are from here you can't come back\nRight and you know limited hill or I think it was like the Nineteen sixties there were a lot more migrant farmers but were allowed into the United states from\nCentral America and then greater restrictions got placed to where it became more difficult for them to legally come here worked for ... and then go back home\nWhich is when a lot of the you know illegal crossings started happening because they were still coming for work they just couldn't jump through the very expensive timely hoops and hurdles\nIt was easier and apparently it still is to just go ahead and make that dangerous crossing than to spend years applying and begging government bureaucrats for permission slips threat not to mention the money that you have to spend yeah in order to apply for those permission slips there's more coming up here more off from the story here the

judge and Apollo Tono making his first appearance at an archipelago Doug Casey Larkin rows and others\nThere's usually dozens of speakers of these events they're huge an amazing event uh it's probably the top and my opinion liberty events on the planet right now I mean it was sold out this year which means it's probably going to sell out again even though they're going to a larger space\nI suspect they're going to sell out again because they were on track to do that already last time we got ticket sales updates and it's been a few weeks and they were at the last time we checked they were at half sold out\nSo go to an archipelago dot com used code empty aisle you'll say Fifteen Percent on your tickets and you'll love the lineup of speakers discussing entrepreneurship investments politics

talk lived or we're going to the phones to the fund Laurel she is a one of the newer co hosts you're on free chocolate normally here in Studio on Sunday nights yes uh but out of traveling you're an immigration attorney Laurel and I guess you to meet with a client or down in Florida that's where you're calling from hello there\nYeah Hi how are you saying you're on the air yeah go ahead\nAnd it had a few corrections see somebody I came from that article I read the article on their ... they're not waiting Twenty years for a visitor and in that article he says that is only for one category that is as siblings every citizen\nFor and what they want their billing of a U.S citizen of either category\nSo they would be waiting Twenty years is the only ones that are waiting\nSo if you've got a sibling or if you're a citizen and you have a sibling who is not a citizen then those people can wait two decades before they might get an approval\nAnd the two decades and only going to be for like ... and what about the other places not\nThat long birth other country that's going to be more like ... because there was a ... or ... depending on to leave the category there to capture some of these categories don't have a cat but that one had the cat ended by country and by category\nAnd I just just to clarify here I've heard people talk about chain migration or what they refer to as chain migration that's what this would be correct\nThey always say that flying term yes okay All right I\nI mean do you ... when when the U.S that it is a sponsor their siblings that also brings with their spouses and minor children you're actively sponsoring your knees and that's you\nKnow if people do that it's going to take ten or Twenty years would that not then encourage them to find a spouse and been have children if the person is currently not wed\nWhy most people get married and have kids anyway so I don't know that that's causing\nRight but no what what I'm saying is let's just assume that I live in another country\nAnd my brother moved here\nAnd he says I Daryl I'm going to apply for citizenship and then once I get it you can apply to move here as my brother and then\nAs your entire family gets to move here too but it's going to take like ten years if I didn't have a spouse\nGot ten years to find a spouse and then just start popping out babies so that my entire family can come over right\nYeah but I think that most people would get married and have kids during that time anyway you know\nNow like there there's a fear that there's this fear among\nConservatives vet if you allow people move here from other countries and get citizenship if\nWe start letting their family come over then they're just going to wind up you know artificially increasing the size of their family so that more people move here and then the entire world becomes American citizens\nOver the course of like a weekend or something I don't actually ... out of the\nFor the for the first person to\nImmigrate the immigration five years or ... even a lot of money like within a couple of years\nGot a twenty five that it's not like they are like ... if you include here but you know when\nWe get to that I wanted to correct the inaccuracies in the ... what is it only a thousand in National Air out of ... a correct\nOkay we actually haven't gotten to that part of the story yet here he says that eighty four thousand visas were granted to applicants from Mexico in the last year\nIt over a million dollar eighty fork out\nEither includes immigrants and non immigrant over a million immigrants and now they're only given the number of immigrants who are coming to stay forever only what he's saying is airing leading ... that doesn't look but people who are just people who are accepting that it\nDealt with that or like a hundred thousand and it's not ... percent of total\nTune curse about\nClaim here that you're correcting is he says\nYes I just think if we had open immigration does the resources that people can be bringing with them to the United states to help them start their lives here and put towards than they productive and not be paying coyotes and other you know criminal organizations to smuggle them in I mean these are people who obviously are capable of saving up a few thousand dollars that's enough to get started some\nAre some as I understand it will um work as a slave basically on the other side for the you know the gang essentially and try to work off or whatever amount they oh I'm\nSure they still pay a chunk to get that started but then they essentially become servants of a gang inventor servitude right\nYeah so great to whatever goal there trying to achieve with their immigration policies that make it difficult and drive people to go to the ... are just making things worse wary about\nLaurel does point out in our just gorgeous out here uh they should be paying her not the coyote [laughter] I guess that's true if you are going to you know do things the legal road it makes sense to hire an attorney if you can afford one because obviously when you're doing legal and stuff which\nIs all this is a ... just legal and hoops and hurdles put up in front of human beings who would otherwise should just be free to cross whatever imaginary line so there's one more paragraph from this guy after ... some of the statistics that Laurel called to\nA certain preemptively actually 'cause we haven't even gotten to that paragraph yet she uh she corrected some of those numbers\nHere's what he ... he he wraps up with he says the rules are almost absurdly arbitrary well yeah\nThere are made up by politicians bureaucrats of course they're absurdly arbitrary and he says and yet my job was to punish those who failed to abide by them the consequences of this realization were staggering I could ignore my own convictions and keep doing the job\nOr I could walk away from financial security status and close knit associations the decision took months of agonizing examination in the end principle one over profit as I left I felt a weight was lifted\nIt was however sooner replaced by the new more bearable weight of uncertainty the same kind most Americans face\nAnd I think what he's commenting on there is that when you've got a government job you're going to go you know as long as you do whatever bare bare minimum of a government job requirements there are as long as you appear to be doing the job they expect you to be doing for Twenty years or whatever you'll get your pension\nJust put up and do whatever it is you're told to do you put however many people in his case behind bars separating families destroying lives just keep doing it for another twenty you know however many years you have left and then you'll be taken care of\nFor the rest of your life and that means you're family will be taken care of it must've been you know it is it can't be an easy decision\nTo walk away from what he's pointing out is that certainty of knowing that hey the government is always going to be there to tax people and pay your paycheck whereas in the working world where you know the the marketplace the rest of us operate [noise] you don't know if your job is going to exist tomorrow\nAnd certainly government jobs can be cut but it's very very rare that government is generally last is\nGenerally when a government job is cut they just don't hire someone after somebody quit they and hardly ever actually wind up reducing the numbers right then they just have a hiring freeze and don't fill vacancies\nSo that's a story that's why he quit the border patrol he actually has a conscience and that conscience got to him after he realized that he was hurting peaceful people that he was not contributing to a better world\nBy doing that and I don't see how anyone could really think they are unless they've totally fooled themselves into believing that these people are enemies like Donald Trump's been suggesting on his Twitter recently right migrants I've\nAlso seen and heard some discussion about whether or not libertarians should take government jobs just to prevent some evil status from getting set a government job yes\nYou're saying they should yes\nI guess they kept his job so that somebody that wants to just go back skins\nI wouldn't go to keep his job and then just do it really poorly like oh man I Can't believe I was looking the other way when those people crossed right now I look around boss but I just couldn't get him didn't see him you know I wouldn't be much much much\nRather have libertarian butts in seats at jobs either if it's something that's even remotely use for early get them at their better serve tax dollars and it's something that's just\nTerrible just sitting there and do a bad job it takes a while to get fired and the government\nThat's true it is very very hard to get fired um I think that\nI'm On your side on this Jackie but at the same time I wouldn't tell somebody who feel a pang of conscience to say stick with it man you know you're doing good work and there you can do less to catch these people settled blame somebody I don't think it's wrong for him to quit his job I think that\nUltimately having that conscience and acting on it should be celebrated but I also don't think it's wrong for somebody who's a libertarian just say you know what\nI'll just go and uh just stick around and not do anything that's you know important in this job and do everything I can to drop the ball and sort of quietly sabotage the system as well there was that old Clare Wolff book I think you brought it up at night off the air what was it a hundred and one thing's\nHundred Lynn ray Litt is the revolution it opens with something like America's that that awkward stage it's too late to work within the system but it's too early to hit the best\nAnd then she wrote a follow up which was like a hundred and Seventy nine more things yeah I think I think\nThat's the title was don't shoot the bastard yet we were we were reminiscing about ... book catalogue the other night\nYeah and so um you know in that book she talks about sabotage being ah like I think the term was ghost or something like that she had like three different categories of what you can do to you know a damn it's the government's legitimacy\nAnd the fact that she had like dozens and that like you know two hundred something things lifted over the ... bucks like different people have different after kids so they are different ways to resist there's different ways to try and change government make it better make it smaller\nYou know sabotage it not cooperate with it and people need to pick what suits them best so somebody just wants to have like a ... year where you know they're hired and for some day and they don't believe in and just be terrible at it until they get fired go for it if it doesn't bother you to do that\n... it was a word you use the other night uh off here and I didn't know what it was can you define without\nYeah ... it's it's like a position where you get some sort of pay are benefit but you don't have any actual duties or we were talking about it and was guards to the register of probate position ...\nNew Hampshire the register of probate basically had all of their duties\nOr remove during a court restructuring split the position still exist and there's still a paycheck ... still exists because it was created a constitutional even the duties where statutory as a hundred bucks for your hundred bucks a year or I'm working on up here in moments or we got actually there's a story about conservatives\nHeld a tough time getting a dates apparently\nAnd well there's a lady in the room so we're talking about dating\nI'm working on up here this is free talk live our two next life Sunday\nIt's been said any society is only three miss meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggression from Russia and North Korea social unrest and violence marches yet again vaguely diluting of stores in city shutdowns and our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long term\nApple juice from a single cyberattack when the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency\nThat's why you need your own plan for self reliance that's where my patriots supply comes in\nGet out for weeks or Bible food supply for only Ninety nine dollars that includes breakfast lunches and dinners order online

of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me the more like myself again\nHard to open up a first\n... changed my life\nNo veterans goes reached out for help you\nOr your stories of strength in recovery that make the connection dot net\nMan tell I our radio you want to hear\nUse the thumb up and some down by to let our program or you know how to make our radios found out that\nThe Saudis changed their story the midterms mass and Michael I'm Evan hanging there growing bipartisan calls the whole Saudi Arabia to account for the death of journalist ... from Riyadh correspondence Sam ... reports how the kingdom story has changed\nWho has been a target of this particular system and to be fair it's happening more often now than it ever has the passport with all the non violent ah you know non crimes victimless crimes that people are are targeted for but if you haven't had that happen to you\nThen you don't know ... ... unless you're already paying attention to the justice system for some reason you don't know how corrupted as you don't know how many people like Russell Brecht haven't put behind bars who've never harmed another human being in their entire lives\nAnd uh and how bad it is and the same way that this border patrol agent who we talked about in the first hour\nHe didn't know what the truth was about people who are coming to the United states he\nHeard the stories he'd heard the horror stories and of course the horrible stories get way more pressed and all the wonderful success stories of all the people to countless millions\nWho've come here to just settle in and make a better life for themselves so the same thing is true and criminal justice reform is there's a large amount of people out there who just figure oh if you're in jail you're a bad person\nYeah and that's all about just about all they think about it that was the reason why they didn't want to build the jail here in Keene\nUh for for those who aren't where we're in Keene New Hampshire there was a jail that was sort of a half hour away in a very small town here previously and they built a new jail to replace that about a decade ago here in in Keene New Hampshire which is the county seat and there were protests over it from like you know\nI don't know if they were all conservatives but you know people who thought jailed bad\nPeople in jail bad don't want to see jail remind me of people in jail or the bad things like this level of\nDiscourse that was going on we don't want the jail on a hill above one of the main roads going into town because it will remind us the jail exist and then we might think about who's in that jail and we don't want to think about those people\nGod Forbid we think about locking people in cages for smoking a plant\nWell and they don't think about that either all they think is there there's criminals in there\nThey don't know what percentage of them and it's about forty percent by the way that are in there for nonviolent drug offenses that's the last time I asked the warden\nOf the jail who happens to be a member of law enforcement action partnership by the way so he's actually against a prohibition entirely but yet it's his job to lock people up and I asked him you know what would happen if you just decided to not lock up\nThe the people who are convicted of drug offenses he said well they'll throw me it\nBecause then yeah contempt of court because it's against the judge's order the judge has ordered this person reminded the custody and if they don't remain that person to custody than\nContempt of court for the the warning anyway Dana I'm thanks for bringing that up go ahead with your comments on immigration\nOkay so um yes and you tell a lot of that works out of my mouth I just want to say you mentioned fried rice a brat\nI also want people to read\nOr what that thirty a dad\nI'm and she got very little time for it I think it was thirty days or something I said those three to four sauce boys are that was raped

I've never heard that so I don't know if they actually believe that\nBecause if they actually did believe that that maybe they would act on their beliefs and we would see conservatives opposing things like business regulations because that's a clear violation of property rights but they don't they just go along to get along they just want to conserve whatever it is they think existed in the past\nYear and a literally it'll be something along the lines of you know traditional value oh yeah that's another one that he can use the fine traditional values you know like how it\nUsed to be well you know God created Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve Darryl dead right there are ... that says that you know something of the okay then go protest red lobster as soon as you get a red lobster and a few there another way it was what I\nLoved it has it also bash I Can't believe I'm doing this but I Will defend conservatives it actually did used to mean something these days it mostly just means reactionary but it actually used to mean something really concerted used to mean traditional western values like property rights\nUm individual independence but also community interdependence through traditional institutions like a church\nIt meant I'm a family structure um you know traditional family structure of a man or woman to children no divorce um you know you go to church on Sunday you participate in your local you know fire rescue squad or your Rotary Club [noise]\nUm and and basically you know the idea of people would look out for themselves and for their neighbors and their for their communities and so there were some\nGood aspects to conservatism unfortunately the way most people use it these days they just mean reactionary they just mean I don't like what the last once or I don't like things changing but then serve it is used to actually have a coherent set of values\nOne of our shatters here or in the twitch chat actually Clinton sellers ruined the game says also keep in mind most conservatives love big government when it suits them they have no problem with the government getting involved in people's looms or marriages\nAnd that's definitely true 'cause if you if you are one of these mythical conservatives the purportedly believes in property rights\nWhy wouldn't those property rights extend over your own entire body well the conservatives were many of the people who are pushing the war on drugs certainly in the Nineteen eighties during Ronald Reagan's administration for instance when I think it was Nancy Reagan who came up with the just say no and of course all that stuff\nWas promulgated by conservatives and nothing liberals or not to blame as well there are plenty of war on drugs liberals as well like\nI think the fact that people are now defining conservatism as against immigration just shows how much damage Trump has done to the Republican Party because they were like they were the or Trump\nNo but they were in till like it used to be in the eighties and nineties they were the pro immigration party and it was the Democrats and the unions who were against immigration because they didn't want to have\nThe they were like Bernie Sanders they didn't want to have immigrants\nCompeting with American workers and it was Republicans who were in favor of opening up immigration and Trump has just\nYou know this this populist uprisings that hijacked the Republican Party and the conservative movement and just turned it into this sort of ideologically incoherent reactionary\nSo now he's okay here's why they believe in the Bible is not your word\nBecause I was going to ask you about something so which parts of the Bible or correct if any [laughter]\nWould you give you if you make out with an audience leaves corrected you or your stupid [laughter]\nWell I'm an atheist so I don't believe in any of that but I ... a site you about specific passages if you're not trying to defend them so I got nothing just\nStupid people to believe and the people in the cloud oh\nWait you're saying the atheist or stupid to\nOf course they are or what do you make let me just fell out of the whole thing how come you up so much God that's what I Want to know what's wrong with you one last question I said how come you screwed up so much I mean there's all these you know you have all these creations the u._s. ... brought to us\nOf course I Love seeing all humans suffer Larry thanks for the call tonight I appreciate it sounds like me playing the Sam's\nThe are not going to the good place the toll free number here tonight eight fifty five four fifty free it's nice to hear a decent a character color\nYou haven't had that was a pretty good crank color and with the sound effects too so like he really had it together who does a good honest to God wants to talk to you there on our discord chats as we go to Carl he's in New Jersey\nAll right we're coming down from God and going back to ... go ahead Carl\n[laughter] little comments or maybe maybe ... I read I heard stories based on what I read about it it it's called a medical care for everyone and Democrats while I get that and then get rid of the\nArticle or to CARE Act but some of your listeners wrote candidate because they pretty much the same era there are hurt\nYeah and they get away from it and when a lot of them want to come down to the United states in ah Oregon and countries where they can get the job done in a decent amount of time and then they won't have to wait for months and months and months and months before they'll actually at the service\nYeah like an MRI this white guy did move down with us today what is that it had to wait six months in Canada so that's the way it is the ... yeah that would have been they wouldn't have found out\nYet answer and it would've been probably age or a fair but\nI was a ... listening to cast recently with Tebow and who's the a a sense of believe that chair of the Libertarian Party of Canada okay in Canada and they called him the leader of the party but you know he's essentially the chair he work in the healthcare industry\nAnd I get the specific test that he was trying to get done but he he was trying to get some blood work done and\nHe was told that because it wasn't medically necessary the insurance wouldn't pay for it and he would have been hit by law from just paying out of pocket to a local lab to have them\nDo the ... when you say insurance you mean the government program\nRight what's he also if you read that information at all other insurers gulp and us they will be a week on because you're only allowed to have a better\nMhm yeah you're talking about the government run or what they call universal healthcare single pairs another term for at its government run health care and yeah it would essentially eliminate the insurance provider is not to say that they're great or anything like that the last um sucks\nOr by the government right there's some would be even worse because then there would be absolutely no incentive for excellence there would be no competition\nOr to encourage people to do the best that they can and to lower costs of course the government regulations drive costs up dramatically as is but it would be even worse or when the government was the only or if the government becomes a these symbolic\nKind of like over in the u._k. where they've got the NHL game saying national correct yeah yeah\nYeah my brother told me forty percent of their paycheck in Britain over there goes towards healthcare mile per se\nI mean that's true or more thing but maybe look on the bright side all their teachers this stuff with the health care would have Medicare\nThey don't have special a health care for the government people write like government people would go to class a place called by the ocean and a dude yeah it's a big concern um and it's once again this is another area where the so called Republican\nConservative people are dropped the ball you know they don't want to see a free market they don't talk about that they just talk about stopping whatever the Democrats want to do now we're going to stop but we just need to keep it as soon as\nWe need to repeal and replace Obamacare and go back to when it was Gingrich care where we came up with the idea back in the nineties or weight and who started or the government\nForced insurance system in Massachusetts before it went to Obamacare oh that would be Mitt Romney's yeah Republican but\nThe fact that we have health insurance is a benefit tied to employment goes all the way back to wage and price controls where they were limiting how much employers could pay people and so they started offering them fringe benefits and that's one of the only reason that that even became something that your employer by for you because\nThat's really weird like think about it what does your employer going by your food for you to buy your car phew it's really weird for your employer to be making a big\nSection of your job you have you might have an employer provided car\nCompany car for company purposes but usually not like we're going to go select what car is best for you and your family because we're going to buy a whole fleet of them for everybody in the company\nWas personal car he's on the line and New Mexico on the ... go ahead David\nThat was close you gotta think further ahead of the airplane and crash or what about you you you you gave me about a minute a warning to click over and I had my hands wet and that just just barely made it in time\nI'm sure you are from yeah your I Am\nSo in the future we'll give you a little warning but ah yeah I wanted to finish up with some er no I'm not going to finish up anyway but\nContinue on with a few more facts about these up all these political racketeering bastards we got a here in New Mexico um and they're everywhere else yes and yes we all expected from them but they really got to the games don't uptight\nWith what they're doing I'm Talking about\nYou know the campaign a process the political process answering to the public and uh you know the the modern day stumped as the media whether it's television or radio\nCertainly politicians do make a public appearances physical public appearances like they go to parades and they write and they have whatever they go to whatever town halls are forums which in actuality that they don't really do that anymore\nI Do when they do there I already controlled right so like only let certain people and if you have an invitation and in order to get an invitation you had to jump through some kind of hoops and go to a website and fill out a form and uh it's very very difficult to get in and then of course once you do get into these places\nYou know they only they only actually give the ability to speak to people who have been vetted a very carefully in advance they submit the questions in advance it's very rare that you'll come you know come across the town hall it happens in New Hampshire yeah like you can go to town halls where anybody is able to uh\nTo speak but yeah I understand the frustrations David and thank you for the call tonight we get more coming up here in

border and that is given Benedict Donald and his friends are all the basis to start to gin up or to uh take two and ever higher\nPeak as it were the the anti immigrant and racist for that is so much the basis of the Republican Party today and look\nI'm not making it up I'm observing what they're doing and reporting the facts and if that doesn't work for you hey that's just the way I perceive it we perceive what we perceive our own way so there is a lot going on today\nAnd I do have time for you of course it won eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one norm at Norman Goldman dot com and thank you so much as always for the emails lots of them I Can't answer them all but I Do my best and they all get rid Norman Norman Goldman dot com\nNow I don't want to spend a lot of time on this I really don't because to me it's it's that gas lighting\nAnd the gas lighting is is from the movie and the ideas to drive someone crazy intensely dry someone crazy and that is what Benedict Arnold is doing and so I have really tried to develop the skill of identifying his intentional fought through cold blooded league intended efforts\nTo try and get us all the meltdown a freak out and get everybody yelling and screaming and get us off the important news distractions distractions\nAnd so what he did was he went\nOut there and he said some horrible things are crazy Democrats [noise]\nRepairs to support any more [noise] of voters security legislation to affect our absolutely horrible old fashioned loop hole wrapped immigration laws so of\nCourse his party runs everything he's a liar but he uh he the thing he did was ... forty to Republican congressman who beat up and Jacobs a reporter\nAnd a guy that you're doing body slammed Mica\nAnd that's what everybody's going for my argument is is it Benedict Donald doesn't give a rat's rear end about any of this stuff it's all done quite intentionally yet a soul melting down\nI see it as a tactic I'm not falling forward I'm smarter than him I was smarter than him when I was six years old and I'm just I'm asking you to just look at it and say he's not an American and that's the way to really deal with this guy\nIs oh did I say that this guy this guy here's how you deal with this guy All right when he does a stunt and ... like this\nWhat we do instead of falling for we say oh you were not an American you're not a patriot Benedict Donald you at just shown us again why you are fundamentally anti American why you're so unpatriotic\nBecause what you have done is you have used violence\nAs a tool and you of encourages violence as a tool against the press\nAgainst anybody else or many find people in Charlottesville that is so radically fundamentally on American because in America we settle or disputes at the ballot box and we're supposed to count the votes accurately and we're all supposed to know the rules of the system out in the open and play by the rules what he's doing his rigging and fixing the system\nAnd that makes him on American because one of the ways these rigging and fixing the system is using violence as a tool of intimidation\nAnd that is so radically on American ... so that's my argument is when he starts in with this stuff just say more proof he's not an American and whoever supports them you're not an American either you don't have the right to call yourself a patriot I'm the Patriot and with that want to get to the main point here which is\nI've been telling you that this is the place where you learn how the system works and every time it was almost everyday lately I've been saying I'm telling ya how the system works All right let me tell you how the system works\nAt its most fundamental\nUnderstand that there's four layers of government four of them that you and I need to concern ourselves with and we pay taxes to four layers most of us have four layers of government think of them is layers from top to bottom that said Lisa my brain views it anyway\nIt's called the federalist system\nThat's overall includes all the four layers the whole thing it's like the universe the name of the universe is\nThe federalist system and that's why they call it over there on the Republican side the federalist society they're trying to wrap themselves in the flag\nAnd patriotism and all this stuff a federalist system says there is a federal government\nAnd then there is a state or provincial level in Canada the provinces writing in Japan there prefecture as there were different names for them but it's the lead it's low or second layer of government it is the more local layer it is the is taking the nation and breaking into\nPieces we broke our nation at fifty pieces and we call them states\nSo weak federalist system as we do it as a federal government and then state governments there's two layers of government right there and we pay taxes to both so we ought to know what they do now\nWithin the state there are generally two more layers for everybody there is a county to county living you're paying taxes to them\nAnd they do stuff too so that's a county layer and for many people I live in the city of Los Angeles if people who live in a city of San Francisco the city of Oakland right that is the fourth way or the one closest to us that\nAnd for some people they don't live in a in a city they don't live in a village they don't live in a township in New Jersey they have townships and and so this is a way within the state to organize localities\nIn some places and for some people they live in what's known as in unincorporated area meaning they don't have a city or town or a village they have the county so they only have three layers of government because the county functions as the local and the county government why oh why oh why do we have\nThis system why do we have four layers government why is it just they want to soak us we're taxing the answer is no\nThe theory the overall the read the whole point of a federalist system and doing it with all these different layers is to keep us much of government as close to us as possible\nIt's about self governance\nVis is designed to be self governing system\nWhich is a federalist self governing system\nThat is designed to give minority views\nSubstantial protection that's why there's this electoral system right electoral votes and that kind of stuff and and and slaves were three fifths of the people I mean the idea was to protect the minority views and in those days and what's in the constitution as the minority views are Republicans and and you know slave owners and that's just the system we're stuck with like I say\nI'm here to teach the system I'm not telling you it's a wonderful perfect system I'm telling you we can work with it if we understand it and we can make it work for us\nHowever we need to understand it for if we understand that there is no chain\nThat's the whole point we kicked out of king we got rid of the king there's no king there's no one to come and set the whole thing right it's up to us who ever happens to grab the machinery of government gets to exercise the power that goes along with it and today you know who is in charge\nSo we have multiple layers of government because the theory is the people ought to be able to have as much influence as possible on the local conduct of their local lives in their ordinary daily existence\nThink about it in Eighteen hundred right when this nation was first getting do and people didn't travel\nA lot they were concerned about their local lives in their local areas they're state mattered a whole lot what state you lived especially back in the old days right before the civil war we in a slave state or a free state right knows life that's a big difference now today\nOr you know look California has lots of different laws that that you know governor in my life as opposed to people who live in Texas or Alabama and so we see the variation and the idea is that that's not a bug that's not that's not an unintended consequences that is a design feature that's an intended saying\nLet the people move freely among the states they can live wherever they want freedom and liberty right and the states have a lot of room under a federalist system to make lots of different adjustments and and so\nWithin a state you can live in different places is rural areas and all the states as urban areas right and you get to govern yourself\nOr have some influence there I have the Los Angeles city council and they'll crab\nBut if I'm if I'm Upset about something right but I Can't go I Am at the right way to go into one of the rural counties in California and give them a piece of my mind but they look at me and say what are you doing here you don't live here you don't vote here you are not stay cold or you don't go back to Los Angeles and complain to them\nRight this is local control and that's why we have counties and cities and that's why we pay taxes because they provide services and we have as ... the idea is to have as much influence as possible locally so\nFirst two words go local I Want you to understand that the system doesn't start at the time it starts with us you and me organizing locally taking over our village or town ship right taking over our city taking ... county in our state\nAnd if you think I'm kidding around looking out the Republicans have done it they took over school boards right they took over city councils they gave me this amazing clip for Bernie Sanders\nNow we need many of them to start running for school board city councils county commissions state legislatures and governors ships\nBernie just listed all the positions with in each in every state he didn't mention the president or Congress right and remember Congress has two branches okay so if I ... I\nI I Hope this is coming through I Hope this is making that I Hope you already know this anyway I Need to finish my present patient\nAnd we have one advantage in the finishing it a presentation\nToo it's split into two there's an assembly or a house of delegates\nAnd then there is a state Senate so\nThe good news is it looks like the same organizational chart in the federal system in in your state except Nebraska where it's a one house legislature in any event you got a governor\nWas like the president charge of the executive branches of the state you've got the judiciary every state has

whenever the federal government tried to do anything that was reasonably powerful if you remember your American history where you want to go back and take a look at the old ... at the fights over the old\nBank of the United states could there be a bank of the United states there were some pitched battles over that people were very very concerned about the big bad federal government taking over their lives and that still echoes of course through to today however\nAfter the civil war and the expansion of the government certainly after the great depression now the federal government is very big and very powerful and very intrusive in our lives and a lot of people don't like that but it is what it is and so we need to understand that there is\nA system that covers the federal government says the same system that governs the state\nAnd that is there's an executive with Governor in a state president and the federal system to house or the legislature in the state legislature in your state capital or in Congress except for Nebraska where it's only one house\nAnd there's a judiciary state judiciary in each state and the federal judiciary and there are lots of rules and laws as to which gets to do what when the federal government does not collect the trash\nRight the federal government does not run the police or the fire service in your area the federal government has its own errors right the bankruptcy court to run through the federal government that then the constitution and so\nWhat we have is a system that\nHas a lot of discretion and open space\nAnd breathing room minute there's politics there for everybody the whole idea is a skeletal system of government was created in the constitution it is a federalist system it reserves a lot of power to the states the states and get to do a lot of freelancing on their own to fashion\nLaws that the people there want and\nIts politics they decide who gets to run all of this and by the way the system was built with all kinds of advantages for minority view points that was to protect this you know the slave owners and all but that's what we're stuck with so I'm trying to teach the system here the point of it all is take over your state\nAnd to take over your state you got to take over your county and to take over your county you've got to take over your city and to take over your city you've got to take over your neighborhood start low bowling build up from there\nThe Congress people and the senators who go to Washington come from your state you have a house district and you have two U.S senators but everything happens in your state\nI wanted to live in California and I love living in California one day I decided that I Want to live in New Mexico or Minnesota or wherever it's one of the great features America can move there but one of the main factor is in me deciding where to live is what laws do I want to govern me\nAnd I really like those in California governing me all ah more than the laws of Mississippi or Arkansas one of these on American states\nThese are not accidents these are features designed by George Washington and the boys to give us the opportunity to band together and to as an organized group\nMaintain and acquire maintain an exercise significant influence over the laws and the and the forces that govern our lives and that's self governance\nAnd if we ignore the system if we just drowning an ocean of apathy and we just say eyes\nToo important is not a boarding it so I was too complicated it's corrupt whatever justification we manufacture and our own mind to give us the psychological comfort to say I don't have\nTo participate I can just watch TV or whatever and not do anything about it well then when somebody else grabs a hold of the machinery right the bare bones of the machinery says okay my politics is different than yours I'm a one and now because you let me Abbott and then we get upset well\nI can only say one thing right and you know you gotta know how the system works and if you don't grab a hold of it and make it work for you or someone else will and you may not be so thrilled with the results are\nThat is how the system works and I'm Glad I put it in just one straight simple place now let's talk about this poor man who got chopped up\nWe had from the Turkish foreign minister let's have a solid today said that he will shatter adult an investigation into the parents' economic shelves the with the world\nSo far this week that he had such insight that Saudi concert here in Istanbul and also you say it douty consul general's residence a few hundred yards away and there have been some report which we cannot independently verify that your mom her show the body may have been disposed off in the ... general resident\nThere you go that's highly Williams of CBS News and we think CBS for then I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised that it was all premeditated they bad bone saw\nThat had the the doctor that does the forensic I you know autopsies right investigations and the doctor that has now been identified as the guy he's really Well hi highly placed politically and he very apparently accomplished like ah\nYou know an autopsy Dr who's very good with the bones saw they assembled this assassination and dismembered ... team with great care\nAnd New York times reported we talked about a yesterday the New York times reported that several of these suspects had been tied directly into the top reaches of the Saudi royal government I mean they're busted they've been busted it's obvious what happened here\nThe tech his foreign minister let's have a child I had to have you had not had any audio recording with any us if they show including secretary of state Mike on\nThat contradict proposing by at least one other news organizations I think that ... may have these audio recording when he wasn't tacky Eliot weight\nAgain Holly Williams up end of a department of CBS News I got to get my networks rally William to CBS News thank you CBS by the way they're reporting that pump pale is heard this evidence my pay up these so called secretary of state by ...\nI've seen a trend [laughter] than networks\nThe headline says I have\nAnd palm pale I say this to you for that guy every words ally and so\nTechnically media is reporting that investigators have expanded that to a forest on the at least on both as well as a farmhouse in a nearby\nAnd that is highly Williams of CBS News yeah they're looking for the remains and my suspicion I don't have facts to back it up and my suspicion is\nThat they're never going to find and it remains those were disposed of it was all for that well in advance and so Benedict Arnold is is compromise he fully in the pocket of the Saudis and he's still helping them concoct lies and this is where we are\nAnd so we have to use the civics of the system I just outlined\nSo that we can take power and prevent this from ever happening again\nMerkel is experiencing a lot of her oh what was it to you and then the sister party you and it's all based on race here in the sex in the region of the worst [noise] North West Germany but it's not just that area\nOh it's all over Europe Europe look at Europe there's a resurgence keys of all these Nazis I mean look at\nAn anti thank you for the call your ... and getting started on a grade no but the point though the lessons that I'm taking away from this is is no victory is permanent and senator former Senator Barbara boxer California taught me that\nUh because that was what you said was leaving office was after a long career politics she came to realize no victories permanent we thought we put the Nazis away at the end of World War two hey\nTimes change new generations come up\nMemories fade over generations didn't teach or for

senior legal analysts time and another one of our popular features as Russia gate and I wonder why that is well\nIt was to merge genetics we've got senior legal endless time because we've done a criminal case that's just been filed in federal court and there's a few important details I Need to share with you about it that won't take very long I'll be right back on the phones with us one triple eight three two one six thousand and one was justice has always served\n\nNow's the time now that you're going to make it\nNow's the time to take a stand to get involved to make a change\nNow

deserve a better way to watch the sports ESPN what do you live for and onto the show for\nWith the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nHis baritone day Thursday and I am so excited to tell you about spit and heart radio podcast where I sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around I don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning\nThat you are part of the revolution you can make family family's luxury\nA huge in grave mistake as many western governments continue to reject the kingdom's explanation of what led to his death some ... reports from Riyadh\nThat's the office that filed these charges and yes it's in federal court\nAnd yes it's in the eastern district of Virginia which means it could easily be assigned to that crazy judge we saw in the Manafort case the judge who was a pain in everybody's rear end if you get assigned him over there are plenty of other judges in that building however\nHowever the chances of they're actually being a trial are slim and none probably more like none because as you heard from the Williams she is not in custody we don't have\nPhysical jurisdiction over her she is in Russia and she and going anywhere where we can get our hands on her SOS unlike Maria Butina right Maria Butina believe that infiltrated the ah the n._r._a. on behalf of ...\nOr she is in custody and then the judge said you ain't going nowhere lady you're in jail and you're not leaving because they know the moment she's out she's going to vanish and so\nWhat we have ears another one of these cases like the one we saw you remember this one months ago with Thirteen Russians were named an indictment and all Thirteen of them are safely back in mother Russia right with it when they never left I guess they never came here\nBut the idea of these indictments from the special counsel or in this case not from the special counsel but the point is in my humble opinion is to alert the public right why would you filed a criminal case and make them public you know point of filing a criminal case\nIf you don't have the defendant the one you're you're trying to put in Britain you don't have them in custody and you don't have no chance again why would you do it obviously the prosecution is sounding an alarm the prosecution is trying to tell us\nHey hey it\nIs the special counsel that just worried about this\nThis is not raw fire Robert Mueller prosecutors this is not part of the special counsel investigation\nFor a couple of reasons the ... the ... the main one is we're told by federal officials this involves attempts to metal in the twenty eighth tail action\nOr the special counsel's job is to investigate potential uh meddling in the twenty six same presidential election\nYou go that is Pete Williams we think NBC News for then yeah\nThis is also outside the scope of Robert Mueller's investigation and so the U.S attorney in my humble opinion is basically sending a warning flair to America saying they're still here\nAnd they're still messing around and please remember they're not taking a a a rigid consistent idiot logical position\nThese troll forms these ... farms and\nAnd this woman here is Elena ... you know I'm not going to try and pronounce it right but in any event she was grading hundreds and thousands of fake identities right to try and make it sound like they're Americans and make it look like they're Americans rabbit pictures making up names that kinda stuff and\nThe whole point was not to take a rigid illogical position this is not an older teen not to just help Benedict Donald know what they're doing is they're observation is and by the way\nPut yourself in their shoes looked at the world through there on yourself and measures but rare\nThrough their eyes they look at America really put yourself in ... look at the world to ... he looks at America and what does he see a never ending bar room brawl that's been true since before the revolutionary war George Washington and the boys this nation was always\nFighting with itself and so if you're ... you say wow these people just love tearing themselves apart\nMaybe I can help turbo charged that so that they will tear them apart so much that we can tear apart America and if we if me ... ... turbo charged what they're already doing over there and get them to break up America then that weakens America they don't get the boss me blender ... around\nThey don't get the be all pompous and pontificate about all my human rights abuses and then I ... you can become a big strong world leader and restore the old Soviet Union empire because America won't be there to stand on my way Vladimir\n... wants to weaken and destroy America to to make Russia strong again right to make Russia great again and he's got his own treasonous you know puppets here in America Benedict Arnold one of them but let's understand the facts and the law here okay\nWhich is what Vladimir who is doing is largely illegal foreigners ally not allowed to do this stuff\nBut but he's doing it from abroad where we can't get a lot of his people you know a A R MIT's on them to put him in prison and we've got the the current party that's empowers actively in bed with the guy helping them\nThey don't care about breaking up America apparently they just want to when they want our money and so we've got a bunch of ... complicit\nQuiz ling treasonous Republicans and they're the ones in my opinion would do in the worst of the damage who is just helping them out they started at ... so we'll go out and said oh\nLet me see if I can help out and make it really bad and by the way ... between the Republicans are boot and they're winning they're doing a nice job because here I Am now saying the United states reports illegitimate we should fashioned ways of of of ignoring them and by the way I got one for years there's been upset a lot of people for that I'm Sorry but\nWe got to work with the facts and live with the truth\nBut the Republicans have been doing look we're still a senior legal endless time what the Republicans have been doing has been\nPlaying a two to standard game they destroy an institution like the Supreme Court they destroy it so that they can take over the Supreme Court\nBut then they immediately turned around to us and they say you must respect it and you must obey the don't respect it they don't obey\nWe say oh my God look good you know but then we respect I mean I'd be forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh already okay here's the problem\nWe're leading to the breakup of the United states and I'm One of the ones helping to do it because the Republicans are forced me to do it\nI Will not respect the current U.S Supreme court I Will not respect Neil Gorsuch corporate cabinet I think they're both illegally and unconstitutionally there and Merrick Garland should be there and that's I have no choice but to declare the U.S Supreme Court on ... ... it was a gentleman and unconstitutional and and\nCheck this out if you want and I look I feel compelled to have to do this I'm Sorry to have to play in the ... his hands but this is what the Republicans have forced me to do\nLook at look at the power\nLook at the power from a Republican perspective you remember that put yourself in their shoes stone yourself and measures looking\nThrough there are now again and get mad at me for giving them ideas I'm not giving them any ideas they're already thinking about this\nIf\nSomeone in Texas Tech ... Mississippi stand\nAlabama Stan Oklahoma Stan Arkansas down all those\nOn American unpatriotic states if they sat there if they really not I don't think right now I'm In the brain so they don't think but if if somebody sitting there going you know\nThis guy on the radio they're saying that this to the Supreme Court's illegitimate you know there's some real power to that argument let's let's take a look at what we can do with that if the Supreme Court is illegitimate\nThat means they're rulings are real legitimate\nThat means at tech says his tank and say you know what let's pass\nA resolution of disapproval both houses of legislature the governor signed it saying that roe versus Wade isn't it legitimate decision and it kept me a forest in Texas and because the Supreme Court sealed legitimate\nRoe versus Wade has no application now we tried the south Carolina led the way with that before the civil war and it got us into the civil war going on vacation right in the states\nIs what I heard there was ends justify the means and at times it can be a very valid argument go ahead I'm cheesy bad guy but he's are bad guy because we are getting the results that's what the Republicans are saying about Mitch McConnell jury broken to send these destroyed the constitution but look at these great judges [laughter]\nYeah well no Mike manning it has never gone to the extent that these Republican tariffs and the\nThe other thing that bans on your point of view of the Republicans will tell you he's worse than anything Mitch McConnell's ever dreamed up of course George hold over with me please all the ... I got to take a quick break the computers will cut us off anyway but the next ... hours you and me we saw with George with justice is served\n\nSounds sounds that no\nMatter how modern your family might be if you're pedaling round bed rock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past [noise]\nMay ... says the electric vehicle has a ride with the salaries and electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president learn more plug into the president dot com or something like a group of America\nThe natural habitats for the creepy ... is a movie that compound being creepy it's that small fixed smiling doesn't have a cousin guys who is more\nWhich showed imagining it's mindless when the creepy to all his the guy to save money but it also gives them easy access to emergency roadside service through an award winning I didn't notice you should switch because yes switching the guy who is a no brainer down the question is out to be telling them from the federal [noise] I Would get off the house\n\nNo matter who we are\nWe all experience difficulties and was a\nMilitary veteran now that sometimes it takes strength and determination to make it through\nWhether it's obvious physical challenges or struggles on the inside it takes strength to ask for help when you need\nI knew that I had to get support\nNot just for me but for the sake of my wife and kids\nTalking about it has helped me some more like myself again\nHere than you left on your favorite I hurt rainy assault than\nSome ... years you're about to make the phone even that I think for the thing the Iranians [noise]\n[noise]\nAs we did not hang up on you you vanished and that was not us in the photos in collapse because I've got other people here say George I'm Sorry I and you probably had to leave something happened and I get it I was not I wanted to give you some more time to finish our discussion but ah one eight eight eight\nThree two one six thousand and one one triple late three two one six zero zero one that is our number and George is welcome back of course any time I need to share with you though some really really significant breaking news and I mean this is really odd stuff the Saudis are now\nWith meeting yes they are there now admitting that they killed ... [noise]\nThey're admitting it I'm not kidding the check out CNN dot com you see any other other outlets are reporting it as well as and Saudi Arabia saying yes\nWe killed him but it was in a fight it\nWas self defense that's what they're saying it was self defense there\nAre now reports Saudi Arabia may ultimately blame a high level intel official for the show gave that both\nThe New York times and Washington Post say a top general maybe accused of Going Rogue an explanation that would just like the blame some crown prince Mohammed bin some on that is war\nProtests to CBS News and that's exactly what they have done the problem is that general they want to get rid of him for other reasons so this is what this is now the Saudi saying yeah we killed them but it was in self defense 'cause he was fighting with us\nHave you see a picture of this guy he's a middle aged pudgy guy he's like me I wouldn't\nBe getting into fist fights with guys with bones sauce and all that stuff I let's remember that first Saudi Arabia said what do you mean she left the embassy All right so they're now with meeting that's alive right they said he met there\nAre we to just forgive you people for lying about this then they said oh will cooperate with any investigation as if they didn't know what to\nNow and they've been lies little lies in between every time retreating another step back towards the truth now they finally admit that you're this I'll get we killed it [noise]\nBut it was self defense right because we were scared at ... am added oh did you see him well what a great\nThey have proven that they are giant pack a liars and that they have purchased the guy sitting in the White House and he's in their pocket and he's helping them cover up and this is a complete disgrace\nAnd if you and I don't get out there a bus stop bugs to take our country back this is going to go on forever one AAA three\nTwo one six thousand and one Ramon\nThanks for being with us a real talk nine ten I Ramon\n[noise] San Francisco Ramon may area Ramon Ramon I hear your loan wrong\nYou went away where mom ... three two one six thousand and one nicotine is can you hear me\n[laughter] I'm here I'm here waiting on the phone\nAnd I hear you you're on the air with many things I'm Glad off owns Avon collapse going [laughter]\nHey thanks for having me back on a well you know I have a another\nYou know on this whole thing and I have it on good authority that just after the election\nIllegitimate president elect draft dodging Donald visited Saudi Arabia on business\nWas official ah you know a government or president trip\nWhere he was criticized by this turtle it's show and apparently because of the sharks out of the culture of tolerance criticism and the new crown princes reaching an ongoing your approach of the opposition and that combined with Donald strategy or do you eat ego maniacal narcissism\nIt would've been they apparently conspired to assassinate his show these bombs do they plan this from way back in the king of the draft dodging Donald Rumsfeld was involved from the beginning\nNow let me see if I got this right you're saying that and that the alleged so called legitimate president elect Benedict Donald went to Saudi Arabia during the transition when did when did he do that I mean do we know the dates of the trip I don't recall that that doesn't mean it didn't happen\nWe gotta look up today if it was it was after after the election but before he took off shift is my understanding\nWell if they're reporting on that was it a secret trip I don't recall that at all\n[noise] All right let me let me do this they deem as I was told her that one let's hold that one let's see splits with we got to work with the fact that the truth I mean I I\nYou know so anyway how 'bout this one there is reporting and I do believe it's credible and it makes sense that cushion or the no good son in law the good for nothing son in law Jared Kushner that he met with NBS Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince the guy who's running things now\nAnd pushing her used American intelligence sources and methods and and evidence\nAnd said here are your enemies and handed NBS a list of those that our intelligence agencies through spies\nRight and and you know intercept and stuff we know ... apparently our agencies know at least some of the people in the Saudis sprawling royal family that we did not like NBS right they picked up a phone call saying you know people complaining about him so pushing\nHer handed NBS soda reporting goes a list of his enemies NBS and him were staying up till all hours in the morning plotting and planning\nMy suspicion is is that cushion are used our public resources to give Mohammed bin Salman a list of his enemies Mohammed bin Salman gave then then gave Jared Kushner like a hundred million dollars as a pay off and then my ... been some and used our nation's intelligence to crack down on his enemies and they all killed a\n... because they're this is their plans and just take over a silent solved descent and just he'll all the money\nWhat do you think of that and this is part of that this was part of the original agreement cooperation between the Donald and the crowd trick dealt with this so this is the kind of thing that would follow the intelligence that was necessary to\nBe able to crack down et cetera and down the line\nWell and you know I'm rambling Chris Christie shut down the bridge lanes to the George Washington bridge to punish the local mayor there or not endorsing him what was fundamentally the most wrongful thing about that\nWas it was taking public property a bridge that we all paid for with our taxes\nAnd giving you to pay for to maintain and the stuff that's public property he used it as part of his own political war his private political war\nThat's illegal you can't use public resources for private gain quote what Chris Christie did with the lanes in the bridge was was crimes compared to what Benedict Donald's doing he's selling our foreign policy for his own personal enrichment he is privatizing the entire US government naked demus on that", "show_name": "Food Talk", "year": "2018",
