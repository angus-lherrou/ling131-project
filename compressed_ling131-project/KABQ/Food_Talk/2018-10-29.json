necessarily go what that crazy guy we don't know anything about that so they kinda just play the you know what we don't know anything about that special section oh there's nothing\nThere's no there's no branch called special section I mean they'll just say all that kind of stuff that we have to say because that's the legal protocol for dealing with and acknowledge special access programs but\nYeah You're welcome to give them a call if you want to but you're not going to get much there but ...\nOne of the callers was going to ask this of according to the notes on my screen but I just didn't get around to it and that is have you brought anything back from Mars or would have laughed who have\nBeen able to bring some back that no [laughter] no it wasn't allowed to bring anything back no camera no photographs do cassette tape with audio recordings no no not that it's it's the cleaning process meaning\nYou know I'd have to turn that all my uniforms all my equipment when I leave that to come back through a screening process that is a medical screening process so even if I had managed to find some you know a rock or an artifact or\nSomething that I could I could show is proven managed it you know to cram it out my but you know they would have found it and pulled it out and I still wouldn't have been able to bring it back so um it's a clean process the cleaning process [laughter]\nRight [noise] it really does sound like we are living on a prison planet here and only allowed to survive a hot the grace of you know these elite overlords this breakaway civilization\nOr and or as you say in in in some of the posts on Mars they are in sleeping humans [noise]\nWhy should we trust them with anything to me and why should you trust them maybe maybe your being used how do we know you don't you haven't had memories implanted and some sort of a psychological screen or or something you know what I'm saying you shouldn't have various people\nA perfectly fair question and and unfortunately the complicated the answer is complicated which is there is no them in the sense that there's one group of people one organization one military organization one financial organization one covert break away civilization organization that's in charge of it\nEverything that gets to make the call on everything that dictates and decide how everything is rolling out there are a lot of actors are in the scene\nAnd there's a lot of people in military intelligence personnel there are state actors or executive elected leaders have executive branches legislative branches\nMilitary liaisons technological personnel industrial technology personnel corporate personnel you have a lot of people who really come together to make up this large lump of covert military space program activities\nAnd there just isn't one that show uh and and it's been over a process of Seventy years that a lot of this has occurred so\nYou have different people running programs than you did fifty years ago you know you have different people in charge of programs and you hit Thirty years ago so it's just not the same group of people doing the same thing decade after decade after decade after decade and then of all the process and it's people who are\nHoping that process as well so again I Would\nGo back to the part that we understand that there's an inevitability ... for this\nAnd most of the people that were communicated with\nUnder the umbrella of various covert military space program activity agree with that\nSome of them still do some of them still think that it's not the best thing to do\nAt this time they want to drag their feet about it but most everyone agreed that just has to happen sometime soon so but I can understand I can understand people being skeptical and have a hard time trusting but it's gonna happen one way or another anyway so enjoy the show\nEditors captain\nKramer great media we have to have you on again we barely scratched the

sentence and this apparently is quite common in the criminal justice system according to a defense attorneys I've talked to\nIt's frightening right All right name so I mean just it's so Curtis green the supposed victim of this posted murder for higher plot came out and said he doesn't believe Ross had anything to do with correct\nUm he said apparently he said that he acted as dread pirate Robert ... times more than one person we know has done this because one of the things you told us in a previous interview was after Ross was arrested somebody logged into the website\nAs red butter Roberts correct I mean how does that happen\nHow can you convict demand for all the things that drove by Robert did than dread by Roberts logs in after he's in jail and and just in the United States Supreme court says no biggie a case here it's it's insane it's like there's there's no there's no even intent at justice\nIt was a whole it was a farce and right to an end for me this case isn't simply about Ross this is an illustration of everything you'd think the you know about the judicial system in the United states is a damn lie you ah been lied to and you don't care\nYou say that your government is out of control but you're not engaged it's so hard to know where to start with this so let's start with today rather than trying to do a recap I heard that Ross has been punished somehow in prison I heard through the rumor mills going\nOn yeah actually um he put himself in protective custody because he refused to assault in other in may\nAnd um yeah there's violent 'cause I so I Know a dangerous and um that mainly apologetic right like even these Mickey's very laid back I mean you can you can read the hundred letters on our website and they're you know from people who know him as a joke to a violent\nAnd um or would ever planned violence or I didn't do that in fact the basic premise of Silk Road was do no harm right you know but in in ...\nThey wouldn't sell poison for instance on the ... there were certain things that would be sold about ... I think I don't think I was allowed\nOr certainly not nothing to with pedophilia ordering voice has stolen property and um weapons violent services or so in any case I'm\nA very asking me up right so the what happened in prison the protection agency so he has some gang wanted him to\nAround ... sure to do this and if you don't then you're a target and he had to put himself in protective custody but unfortunately I mean he's been sitting in a metal box now for six weeks\nOr whatever it was just the is ... it was awful I mean he was all a Terry right\nNow there is actually he wasn't solitary and then they did it now he has a um [noise]\nYou know some of the author was an air for his protection\nWhy because Russia is put into a violent up Britain for the most violent people and violent gangs because of his sentence not because of his security level which would put him in a low right by because anyone with a life sentence goes into a maximum\nShort because while we'd ask yourself what would they do to get out and the answer would be in many cases um you know desperate things [noise] but yeah\nI mean he's got a friend who is doing why for marijuana while informant said he sold marijuana Thirteen Years ago and he's in there so unbelievable it is unbelievable and the person the Colorado that's the final irony\nAnd now that he's uh right right where it's legal um ... the Russians at the supermax\nNow he's the one must step down so it's um the maximum which is one lap it's where the supermax people get to go in there they have\nNice so they've moved him because he was originally in New York wasn't he didn't you have to sell your house in Austin and moved to\nNew yeah we did we went on your you know in Colorado following yeah I mean yeah I sort of a nomadic um we have an Internet business and I just feel very very strongly that it's important for him to have a lifeline ... to me or you know I'm On the constant but then to friends or family [noise]\nSo many guys in areas where house with no one oh buddy and his becomes their life and and and so I Believe yeah so I'm In Colorado for now and then hopefully he'll be moved somewhere safer will go there you know\nSo I mean so he just has to sit in the cell handle till they decide where to send them oh so they were gonna move someplace else\nAnd I don't just do it because if they put him back there and he could get you know like oh I Know a woman whose husband ended up in the hospital because of the thing you know you can get really hurting their\nWealth and so let me let me see if I understand it basically some prison gangs says hey Ross go beat this other in made up and he chooses to or not chooses a chooses not to be said no and he says no I'm so they say well then you're going to get beaten up\nBasically certainly don't have anything better to do with their time [noise] [laughter] well of course not [noise] um so that's what's happening with him he can still receive mail I take it\nYeah just now mail 'em you can't make calls he has a new book okay I cetera notebooks now he's a Bible they let them have a Bible religions because because he's in a\nProtective custody even if I mean

I think so yeah\nThere's a difference between ... and yoga pants to imagine many localities ... and then the top is just like what's it like a tank\nTop thanked cropped up yeah\nIt's um it's wearable described the art if you could I Know it's really complicated I make I mean it's like graffiti art yeah and I use usually recycled materials and\nUm there's plenty of scraping background with the big one logo and it looks pretty funky people seem to like it have you know due to share it women's clothing stresses that better do\nThis you know the crypt a flag in the space really sucks like bare minimum design and ... like twenty bucks and whatever for method option but I wanted to give it some some high fashion you know so I Know there's more people in that space now creating a little bit more high fashion and are there oh okay yeah yeah we're still operating a couple projects city so if I'm\nSo I've I've got some crypto art I like that and that was it yeah it is simple but it's a good and it's old too apparently somebody was telling me that they have their shirt that they paid a crypto for like five years ago and so now it's six thousand dollar shirt or something\nLike why does that come in and like a little bit corn for it a band the day you can pay for it could have done my ...\nStore as well and I love that being able to support the movement just by taking you know commissions from\nThat so how's that going I mean so it's a none none of ... and ... and you B.

New Hampshire and spend it you know half a dozen different place\nMan there's some there's some uh food trucks that they get now I'll see if I can connect the okay there\nWas supposed to be a taco truck and I sent them an email and I tried calling to find out where are you yeah 'cause I heard that they exist and because I heard they have this Mad Men walk to hunting down but yeah there was a last year at this conference they did have a food truck that was taking crypto oh yeah it wasn't the one food truck\nBut and also the other systems are becoming better like now you know to tell you the art on the ... NFC chip near field communication chip you just scan them over putting them on your physical art and their instantly on the blogs and so you can do that with the the wearable clothes and you can do that with murals and so I think that\nWhat you've got shipped to hold on well yeah you wash those during the ... so you put the NFC chip and rather than make a little nicer residents how do you so you don't see her clothes it's not permit the water can get to know it can get them and it's just it's a fun proof of concept you know it's not you it's not\nEasy to do and it's not most convenient it's all hands but it is making it proved to redefined value to use art devalue because when you see it on the block to and what do you mean like a well what's that mean so when you scan the NFC chip\nConnected to your close friends um you can you I'm using the blocked in our collective which is an awesome up really close friends that have this system you basically log in all the information and agree it's a ... and it's just I provide density originality and so they go to explain that every day\nOh approval originality meaning this is the genuine article this was the real thing from ... somebody didn't send it to a Chinese ... knocked over there and it was right there on the block to enter the area and so that's so cool yeah that's awesome you are on the cutting edge of\nA of crypto art it's fun man is really fun ... dot com slash are now you know last time we talk to you were kind of getting into media did you ever pan\nOut without podcast idea or is that something that got you got too busy for and I\nDid but he became a decentralized broadcast I ended up interviewing people on my channel and then going on a lot of interviews and it's just become more fun to to do interviews than to have my own caucus because basically painting fulltime shipping heart I just had my last time parents um ice ship might two of my favorite pieces and they sold like the first day and well off and\nIt's it's been really reassuring to see that the art is something that people like and the joy\nAnd keeps me inspired to make it hard about it so\nWell there's not a whole like you were saying there's not a whole lot of good are out there there's one guy who's your who's really good I don't know I Know he does\nHe puts wallets and his paintings were jeopardy yards and so there's actually there's a lot of really amazing art in the grip of space there's probably about um I Would say Fifteen artists that are the most well known that are incredible and that are\nThat are trained and everything it's just amazing but it's difficult to connect those artists to project so that's I mean that I'm working with um some brands to try to hook it up and move marketing budgets to our budget so that artist and get paid to do what they love sure and I mean\nLeading the a lot of the campaigning on social media as well as on several different platforms such as this one so what do you go I mean what's the website going to be as it already registered as there's something there it's crypto eat cues that that's the R. Y. P. T. O. you could do you eat cue\nDot ... dot I. O. R. editor what if you go there now you can actually sign up for our newsletter to get our alerts as well as potentially be involved in the beta launch to tell me your story though just if or how did you get involved in the crypto universe okay so I actually me and one of the other co founders we actually work together at a company called aligned group in Houston\nAnd me and him we were just talking about crypto every cancer we had we would talk about crypto this was actually before the hype this was like\nMid to early twenties Seventeen we were just like we kept hearing about it and we looked into it and then we went down the rabbit hole at first I was actually a skeptic probably like ... have you ... I was like what is this big points though like I'm not trying to buy any drugs or anything like that on line I was like I don't need this stuff\nAnd my friend was like you know they'll be so close minded you know look into what did you hear about\nAnd I started digging I read the ... motives white paper and then we went down the rabbit hole from there I started looking at all a by the way a ... white paper came out October thirty four years ago if you're saying yeah\nYou have a few days from now ... there's a very cool this great to be here at this about a decade later so it gets so was it the white paper that kind of convinced you or paper\nAnd then I looked into when I saw the types of games that was happening\nThat technology behind it I started looking into blocks and blocks and it was actually about ... ... that's the technology the bags the technology behind\nBig level of ... the distributed good a decentralized public and then I've always been somewhat of a person who believes in being of sovereign and you know taking a controlling ownership and accountability for your life as to what\nBitcoin crypto currency is doing is giving you the power the people the power back\nFor for them or ... I mean it I mean\nIt's it's been in the hands of governments in banks for generation I'm ... I mean this is the first time and but you know that there was kings and oligarchy is right that we're in control it was always a big group or one individual that was in control right now we're distributing and decentralizing all this power to the to the people yeah I've said\nBefore that it's hard to really expressed to people how important that is you know the concept of distributing that power the power of money right one of the most important things\nThat governments and banks have historically had total control over and have used field that power against all of our interests by printing out money right the inflation process yeah we can all of our buying power I was explaining this to a cab driver who was bringing me from the airport the other night who'd never heard of a decline before he's from Ethiopia\nAnd of course he uh you know send money back home right over Western Union and money granted these systems that charge a hefty fee before you know five bucks may not seem like a lot to everybody listening but if it\nIt adds up it does add on transactions every day or every other day yeah and in your living paycheck to paycheck five dollars is important it's a big um and if you can take that five dollars down to five cents\nThen that's a huge advantage and make ... right semi instantaneously if you don't have to fill out a bunch of forms and there's no approval process and you cut out the middleman and so like\nIt's like I said it's hard to really expressed that people how much of a paradigm shift this really is absolutely it's kind of like Paul said and one of the talks earlier at home mom from edge yeah it's right for a while it he says it's like it's one of those things you don't think you need and so you need it\nYeah right he was like why are we ... we don't really take vitamins that much but why is big pharma such a big industry because people don't care and so they have to take care of it until they have to go and get the treatment the medicine and whatever it is\nThe same thing with money with everything we don't want to be inconvenienced with having to deal with it or having to worry about oh no I'll just let a government take care of this from Arab Bank handle it for me because I don't want to take responsibility for another thing in my life is I'm already overwhelmed well yeah if you don't want to take responsibility than the person who does is going to take a cut back they're gonna\nYou lose the action and on and so this does require people to take responsibility which is something we want to encourage people to have you have to take responsibility for your finances um and so I imagine these some of the things you talk about on your podcast which is called every day king\nThe king so actually the everyday things a little bit different so that's actually me and one of my business partners back in ... and we're talking about is the everyday show about values and being a modern day man\nSo we're focusing for me what it is for me is we're focusing on the individual that are on that journey to their quote unquote success there on their way to building their fortune five hundred company they're on their way to launching their\nNonprofit organization or their castle ... whatever it is these are people that have the big games that are going out there and trying to execute on the everyday kings trying to ruin the kingdom essentially is what they what you were trying to spread the awareness and those people because it's such as an iceberg\nSo are you see the ... outside just you know your radio show how many hours did you put him before he even had a lot sizeable audience right yeah you were on that grind before you find any kind of got your break or that time we were like oh now it's actually something that I can uh fulltime as profitable but you put in the time you put in the hours it was fine\nBut we don't people don't highlight that enough people don't talk about the people are going through the process so we wanted to highlight those people so that's what we did was that's what we're doing with every day can spot gas very cool is that uh how do you often do you do it every week or every Thursday so yeah we're on episode twelve so we started about twelve weeks ago\nWell yeah but it's like we're in everyday kings podcast dot com predict kings ... at the everyday kings on Instagram as well if you want more information and at so great for Joe on every dining on every day you can find me\nAnd I'd be glad law question or anything yeah I have on my blog stuff on my personal brands of everything everything that happens in my life for the most part\nAnd how how often do you argue blogging and ... so actually so this summer I did a hundred days of daily blogging wow so for a hundred days I have so you can you go to my YouTube you'll find my blog playlist about a hundred and twelve videos\nWhere I did it was a hundred days straight and after that started getting to weekly\nIt's actually haven't done it a little while for them to start picking it up again but just been so busy with crypto cue and trying to grow this brand go this audience podcast kind of put that to the side for a little while but I'm going to get back up for sure what the what the camera here oh yeah that was it absolutely is that for that is also that for content for our ... page OK\nOkay we have a

then you got your you've got some experience man and I appreciate ah where you're coming from on this new trying to hold these government bureaucrats accountable for not following their own rules

almost every single time not a single one of our do a lot of research good\nLuck with your resume to broken collar bones three dislocated ribs broken elbow attitudes knocked out been there done that\nFrom trying out some of the things that I Know a lot of things not to do\nFight or how you learn what not to write so you were telling us the story you were in a courtroom to help a friend that yang and you'd fall to some kind of motion with the judge to each other and we were stopping in eviction to challenge subject matter jurisdiction\nUm and the judge said I don't want to read that air or whatever he admitted that he hadn't read it and said he was denying your motion without having read it and then you you went all the mail is\nClosed my folder told the judge were done here walk to the bar appointed a debate if you come with me stormed out of the court [noise] and then\nThey got out of the courtroom the Bailey said what can I Do for human scale to the need you to arrest a judge\nWanted I rushed to judge class a misdemeanor official Russian criminal violations thirty nine oh three penal code in that he failed form of due to his required to perform and the process and I mean full free access to enjoyment right he said well Mr ... or ... did he deny you in [noise]\nBut he denied being a combination under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nRight 'cause you'd ask for a hearing aid or the\n... said well why didn't you tell the judge about the Americans with Disabilities Act\nHeck out of doing that he might have turned the sound up [laughter] you know the daily stood there are a minute this green come across his face so you said well yeah he was a sucker for that money that is what it gets real smarter [laughter]\nThat got around the county ... and after that if I walked into a courthouse and in turn or Dallas County\nAll of the Bayliss they're gone I don't want to see you they might out of the most watched and they did not want to see me but I got a big surprise two days later I was at a political rally ...\nAnd I thought I recognized the security guy when I came in and I'm floating around the pavilion and he came up to me and it was that bailout ha ha yeah he said Mr comes from a I've got some guys are like you to meet\nAnd he explained why we're walking over there that they're Baylor some around the county and they do security at these functions make extra money I've seen them doing that in New Hampshire to he brings me in the room and he said this is the guy that set up have\nAll of these babies ran over oh wow that's great [noise] they did I don't like him\nThese judges now we go into court and we think the Bailey for Easter jak booted Doug mhm but everybody's human beings here this base of human me every policemen are no became a policeman so he could be a good guy so people yeah they\n... some of these judges treat these bailouts like trash\nDo they treat 'em a crash and the bailiff stands there and watches the judge ... grew one person after another and they hate it [noise] but there's something new about it right\nThen I come in and stick it to a judge and these guys are just thrilled is a good education for me yeah that is in doing what I Do\nThere are no bad guys here\nEverything is wrong in this system mhm and there's not some individual that we can single out a and vilify beyond all redemption in royal at and righteous indignation do bad guys here\nNot the judges not to prosecutors not the police this is a system they did not create [noise]\nThey got in the business and found it wasn't what they thought it was and they were trapped inside it\nLike a quit if they wanted but hey the money you know it was just noticed is that you're going to quit your job because you don't like you get once you get yourself committed to a career you've kind of stuck on that sure you don't have lawyers if there is a bad guy you well that you and me\nBecause the first we are we are citizens in a republic\nAnd we ask our police to police us to keep us from doing stupid things are getting hurt or get somebody else or\nWe don't return the favor [noise] you mean to police the police police the police it's our job [noise] I think my public officials like I Do my grandkids mhm I Love them dearly\nBut all the times they behave badly most of the time one of 'em runs out in the road I'm fixing to Dan here that it's not out of anger or avarice it's about keeping them in line and the best way to go after these guys is not wait till they do something horrendous\nCoax them into stepping across this tiny little line and land on like a ton of bricks\nNow they get worried\nHow do I keep this from happening next time mhm\nYou know when since I've been doing this show\nIf you don't know where you're going you know a good chance you'll wind up somewhere else sure I have a goal goal has always been to place every judge in the country in a position such that when he steps out behind the bench and looks out across the board the gallery I won't even wondering which was\nWhich one of those in a hole in eggs out there waiting to be rid of the ... you don't lecture and going down ... you're trying to get me indicted\nYou always ask the bailiff or the policemen to take his chicken shoot off\nAnd it sounds really dumb doesn't it [noise] but what the officer is going to want to do is accused you of being\nAgitated\nMansfield, Texas same day a pool that [noise]\nThe trick on the judge I went to the mass feel police to have them arrest the judge 'cause the bailiff wouldn't do it and the officer got real excited one of these pipes skin tattooed too much uh anabolic steroid guys\nAnd uh when I told him to take his chicken soup off he was so furious he was shaking [laughter]\nA friend of mine called me he said what were you doing in Mansfield yesterday minding my business can well my brother who was the Mansfield city attorney said that that officer told him you were agitated\nUs it can't ask Craig ask that officer if I got agitated before I ask him to take his chicken suit off or after [laughter]\nShe said us get your desk and that that I always ask them that and that's because whenever you are in front of one of these officials always keep in mind what we'll play well before a grand jury of my peers\nAnd when they accused me of being agitated and I tell them I ask him to take his cheek and sued off it just discredits so I did this to the bailiff here and he refused [noise]\nAnd I told him I live it's filled with little citizens we all get to make them when he absolutely refused a judge set there and kelp his mouth\nShut I've done this about a half a dozen times in court and never once has the judge opened his mouth\nBecause he knew and at that point he knew I knew one word out of him\nWhile I'm making a criminal accusation to the court security officer against Sam\nWitness tampering obstruction both of them felonies the judge kept his mouth shut when the bailiff absolutely refused the judge picked up the gamble and he said Mr ... I'm Sorry you didn't beat up yet he said Mr bailiff ... does leave the courtroom your interest him\nI said with all due respect your honor that's cheating he picked up the Gallup gavel held it up and said maybe but I got the gamble [laughter]\nPoint now turn to debate if you come with me and stormed out of the courtroom was that was so much fun [noise] then I made a criminal complaint up against him and took it to the Texas courts criminal appeals against a judge against the judge and up to ...\nTexas quarter criminal appeals in Texas we have two high court's Supreme handle civil court of criminal appeals handles criminal so I take it to the ... and the\nClerk said well you have to file a motion for leave can fire\nYou kidding me this is a ... is\nThe great writ the risk of right this court has no power to grab door denies leave he said well I Can't take it without it while not my ... I'm trying to get this kid out of jail so I filed a motion to relieve of how the habeas\nNext day they deny by ... the nine my believed to file the habeas the next day I went to the grand jury with criminal charges against all of them mhm it took a year\nAnd finally the prosecuting attorney gave my criminal complaints against the highest judges in Texas to the quarter criminal appeal to the grand jury\nAnd I thought it was all of my eloquent oratory and all the pressure I put on my Bush whacked the hip criminal district judge in Travis County with these criminal complaints\nI thought it was all this stuff I went in with camera crews mhm oh just did all kinds of crap [noise] had nothing to do with any of that was important lesson you will never get public officials to be afraid of you\n... you will get them to do is be afraid that you will create cannon fodder that one of their political enemies can use against them\nRon Earl twenty five year district attorney not running for office again\nHe's a Democrat or none of these judges are Republicans that dirty rotten scoundrels\nTook my complaints tried to use them as cannon fodder to take those judges that within\nThe grand jury got my complaints the first day in office wow they know build their last day in office these nine judges sit there for sat there for three months I Wonder if their careers going to end tomorrow nothing absolutely nothing they can do about it\nI it's interesting that you were able to actually get a complaint taken by because you can't bring a complaint direct to a grand jury at least not in New Hampshire that I'm aware of man 'cause how the hell you reach them because you have to go through this district attorney you got to go ... where's that at all I don't know how you get to them they've got um protected\nOh that's okay you don't have to get to the grand jury uh-huh it's about boxing I'm up to the fed pets are the same way so what I Do is make up a criminal complaint against the bad guys and I send them to the prosecuting attorney\nAnd he doesn't give them to the grand jury of course not to make up criminal complaints against in the district attorney mhm for fueling from prosecution who to give that to our mail it to the foreman of the grand jury at the district attorney's address\nUh-huh registered restricted only the foreman can sign for it and it goes through the mail room to a guy in the mail room at a minimum wage stamps it prosecutor gifts that he opens it up he's looking at criminal complaints against himself right\n... hoping that you want to do was to open up and he looked at it and he says a scoundrel set me up his right we do [laughter] so what are you\nYou do now but the next step is said\nYou and good that the grand jury or do we go to the feds under Thirteen porn forty one Eighteen years go Thirteen forty one you use interfere with the public mail mhm [laughter] it's about making everything they do\nCause things to be worse yeah and they will never stop fighting you\nThis time when you take them on they will fight you all the way to the u._s. Supreme ... but the next time you come to them they get this and I say I just had a friend of mine from Dallas County send a criminal complaint against the foreman of the grand jury in white parents county which\nIs Fort Worth you wanna stick with us yes already comes here it's rule of law radio dot com that's his website this is talk library here at the Texas bitcoin conferences and ah I Love a third person who's actually got courtroom experience who's actually tried to things he talks about it's rare to find somebody like this is talk lots more coming up\nFolks this is very important information what's to be said about CBD\nAre CBD is made from hemp\nAnd has point zero zero three T.

Robert Bork there was a hero for the Republicans\nBut there's something else more did that got him torpedoed in my legal opinion you want to hear that one\nWas that the reason Supreme Court nominees since Robert Bork never talk in detail about their policies and theories of the law they speaking generalities it's because of what happened with Robert Bork\nRobert Bork in his testimony laid out he's legal theory of basically roe versus Wade I mean it was being applied to roe versus Wade he set\nOut in next wiz Italy detail I think it was like a four border five part test where he said\nIf a lot of the Supreme Court is a B C D any then it gets up hill live it's not a B C D or eat it gets overruled and everybody especially the Democrats said hey wait a second you just sit out a new legal test\nFor over ... versus Wade and that's why the Democrats went after him because he said he's being installed by Ronald Reagan to overrule roe versus Wade\nAnd the legal test that he's going to import Jesse manufactured this theory just loaded up out of his brain and and it's going to imported into the laws the Supreme Court justice with all his fellow Republicans and so the Democrats said\nYou just gave us the formula to defeat you because you showed us how you're going over the world versus Wade and it is my humble legal and political opinion that that's\nWhat ultimately torpedoed the guy uh\nUh and and so since then oldest reporting on these just don't ever do we're working don't do what you plan to do that's my theory on the matter I\nAbsolutely I heard that absolutely so thank you know this\nBut since then but since then Pam since then\nBasically the Supreme Court has been\nA giant battleground old vote only lately has become the massive better run I mean even Alina Kagan was was confirmed and Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by some big numbers so it's it's gotten so toxic now that the whole institution is illegitimate and that's sad Pam thanks I think that was born with justice was or\n[noise]\nOr radio you want to hear\nSome up and some down by to let our programmers you know how to make our radio sound out but [noise] [noise]\n\nDay\nBy\nThe way\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know\nTo me [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAh [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're getting a great interest rate you're getting the interest rate you deserve consolidate all that high interest if you carry imbalances Eighteen percent you don't need to do that you don't need to do twenty four percent you can stretch the terms you very flexible you can borrow between five and a hundred grand check out light streamed dot com slash\nNor man because you you you need to in order to get the special offer because the show conceive eat you this show to save our listeners even more with an additional interest rate discount on top of light streams already low rates but the only way to get the discount is to go to light stream dot com\nSlash Norman think of it is light streaming through your window because that's in L.

remember the name Brett Kavanaugh that's who we're talking about Brett Kavanaugh is been on there and what a couple of weeks now\nAnd I have been asking have we forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I'm very happy to report that no we have not forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I am for my part will never let us forget about Brett Kavanaugh this is a disgrace\nAnd that's nicely put that's putting it nicely okay\nYou'll recall I Know it wasn't that long ago your call that the the overriding theme about Brett Kavanaugh was can we investigate\nAll these complaints that are coming in right that was the whole point was their people were popping up everywhere and they were making allegations that I have no way of evaluating them it's not my job nor is it your job we have no way of evaluating this stuff people pop up they make allegations\nBrett Kavanaugh denied how the heck do we know whose line is telling the truth\nThat's why we do investigations so everybody was saying\nWe please take some time and investigate it now of course let's not forget the politics Democrats trying to run out the clock the republic is trying to a gym through right it's all about the election coming up so you know there's no point to to to have any claim to principle by anybody here it was just a wrong naked political exercise we understand\nAnd so when the Republicans refused to investigate right Dr Christine Blasey Ford's allegations when they did the IDF the FBI do the most slap dash comical ridiculous non investigation and as they see it's okay now\nRight when they did that what the Republicans did was say we refused to investigate we won't investigate the claims of a lot of these claimants that there were people you'll remember popping up saying I knew Brett back then and I can see this and I have this information right now all these people were just ignored\nAnd then of course we had Julie sweating it do you remember Jewish sweat neck I Know that name sounds familiar and Michael ... we all know Michel ... right okay Julie sweat Nick remember this one she alleged that back in the day\nShe was at a party where she was basically fed Mickey right you slipped to make you somebody you know got a very very drunk and she was taking advantage she was in fact gang raped that is her story Jewish wedding ... she was gang raped\nAnd she said that Brett Kavanaugh and his buddy mark judge ... at the party but me to her knowledge did not participate in her gang rape which to me sounds very honest I mean\nNo you're going to lie why stop anyway so\nThat to me was a a a credible enough allegation I mean she was in school and the play and there were all these associated facts around through was sweating it that that screamed out\nVery Rapid City truth I mean she was in the place right there it's not like she was from you know Nevada or Nebraska you know or some place in as all of a sudden like\nHow did you get into Maryland at this time me she was out of school at that time she had friends who could verify she was part of that social said she was at the the parties there around\nI mean she was obviously somebody who was in place at the time to in a place in a position to tell the story she was telling\nSo all of those what I call associated or background facts right that to to get us to the point where her actual allegation of this is what happened to me that night in that house and this is who is in the room to me it's like okay go investigate and Michael ...\nWell the Republicans of course as you as you know as the historical record will now reflect didn't investigate\nCharles Grassley here senior legal analyst I biggie Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer he's a farmer so they say he's actually he's actually a ... he's a mummy who's been shipped from Iowa and I don't think they want him back\nBecause he's been in Washington for about six years now and I think he's mummified but and he's not a lawyer back you know maybe when he was a teenager you know back in the Eighteen ... or whatever I he you know he was a farmer but for my part part marijuana sound smog I really don't I mean I\nI go after other people from being smog I don't want to do that\nBut I just think as a matter of wise public policy making is probably a good idea to have a lawyer in charge of the Senate Judiciary committee made it just helps because you get ... it's like being a quarterback in the NFL you have a broader view of the playing field you see all the nooks and crannies the nuances\nThat's why lawyers run the legal system because it's complicated there's a lot of reasons why it's complicated and it's not just to ... people for legal fees to protect their rights anyway before I go down that tangent overrode Senator Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer\nWho presided over the the debacle that was the whole Brett Kavanaugh experience uh Charles Grassley now has found a sudden new interest investigations yes I'm not I'm not making this summer I mean Mitch McConnell gonna help me a message I mean you got make this stuff up and and I am not\nSenator Grassley is now demanding an investigation of Julie sweat neck and Michael ... saying that they made false statements before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre so I'll let you fill in all the punch lines and the ... that you want cars that situation Senator Charles Grassley demands investigation of Julie sweating ... this comedy material just waiting to be had there I Will go with the law part\nAnd that is this we have seen this in the past where Congress for political reasons uh demands were makes reference to the department of justice to say investigate and prosecute and the answer is yes they can ask but they cannot compel\nThey they cannot directly compel\nThey can sort of compel I mean the department of justice is funded by Congress so when they senator\nWho happens to be the powerful senator of the Senate Judiciary committee or the ... they mentioned the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee whether he's a lawyer Nazi relevant he's the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee at the very powerful position and if he gets mad at your agency or your little unit within ... he can go over to his buddies on the on the budget committee and\nAnd and take out a giant chunk of your budget and so that's kinda how you know\nThe the Congress can coerce the bureaucracy to do with Congress once but not directly can't directly forced them to do this and so this kind of thing\nGoes over to the department of justice and they have the right to kind of back pocket the thing and say yeah OK Senate write him a letter saying we acknowledged your request for an investigation will certainly take a look I Will get back there and then they back pocket the thing and and you you don't hear from it ever again\nThat happens and it is the right of the department of justice and more to the point the prosecutors because what Charles Grassley has really asking for is not an investigation he wants to prosecution he was punishment\nHe wants it images and so he doesn't want investigation with prosecution and no senator can force a U.S attorney to\nProsecute a case that's the the the independence of the you know checks and balances right the different branches because the prosecutors during the executive branch and the Senate during the legislative branch so the to the extent though the legislative branch as ... as\nInfluence over the legislative branch is sue the money is funding the agencies and all of that\nBut in terms of who's the boss of the U.S attorney\nLike for the district of Columbia it ain't the Senate it's it's that's the guy in the White House\nRight part of the executive branch through the through the attorney general right to the U. S. juries are part of the department of justice like the FBI is part of the department of justice and the attorney generals in charge of the department of justice and you know who's in charge of the you can hear me smiling you know who's in charge of the department of justice right\nNow he's a little guy was with ... years he's a little elf he looking guy\nIf I were key blue eyed file a lawsuit he's he's he hurting their trademark I Am not a right as well you know he is All right one Tripoli three two one six zero zero one is our number and David I'm really glad you waited in Minnesota you're on the norm mangled manager\n[noise] [laughter] Oh thank you owe on your show the machine Norman thank you what\nThis feels cut out for sure lawyer I was I heard something about um gone Arizona that the Republican controlled legislators are just passed a law or trying to pass a law\nThat will take away your free speech and if you think about they will ship out put you in prison\nFor safety still to this day it is the NFL is number one blooper [noise] this week in Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers played their first home game\nLosing to the San Diego rockets one tend to Ninety nine this weekend Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium open\nThe Dallas Cowboys be the New England patriots forty four to Twenty one stadiums unique root structure covers all of a siege unless the playing field exposed to the elements it was often said that the whole on the roof of designed to allow God to wash his team play [noise] yes [noise]\nLike God's the cowboys fan this week in Nineteen Ninety event or Holyfield knocks out James buster Douglas fir the heavyweight boxing title as we can Nineteen Ninety three the NFL announced a new fashioned seen the Carolina Panthers will\nBe in Charlotte and they will begin playing in Nineteen Ninety five and this week in the year two thousand the Monday Night miracle occurred down thirty to seven at the end of the third quarter the New York jets pulled together and improbable comeback with poor touchdowns in a field goal in the fourth quarter eventually defeating the Miami Dolphins forty ... thirty seven in\nOvertime that your heart radio weekend sports time capsule\nAnd flood college football coverage [noise]\nTo do what's right you have\nTo offer a helping hand\nChina now's the time to volunteer to raise a hammer and drive and now's the time to build a wall that\nNow's the time to open a door to a new law and help maintain now it's time to help habitat for humanity they'll hope and change lives but the family and your community\nNow the time they\nEver\nVisit habitat or we all make promises big small I pledge allegiance to the United states of America\nI Do solemnly swear to help you when you are in\nThe caring loving\n[noise]\nOr\nNext nearly hour and you and me on the phone at one triple a three to one six zero zero one and that means Jeff on W.

Bush and his and his criminal friends on Wall street brought down economy none of these things are crimes so\nI hear you loud and clear Jeff and the problem is is that what we saw when George W. Bush and and the criminals I Want to be brought down the economy was exactly what you're talking about two systems of justice this country is still upset\nAnd I believe one of the big reasons Benedict Arnold got as close as he did stealing his way in was because we didn't hold Wall Street accountable\nThey stole all the money they rig the economy they took it all it came down crashing down people lost their homes lives were destroyed they got bailed out then they were left in place and they're all still they're making even more money now the the depths of seizing\nThe air is still not understood by the political leading this country and so a lot of people saw\nThat and see what's going on and say why\nAm I not get my head against the wall here to do live under assistant lives rancid and corrupt that you know the rich are getting away with everything the boys on Wall street are getting away with Eric Snowden cocaine by the bucket full right drinking champagne while they're doing it making all this money and ... you know I got to be worried about going to jail for a dime bag of pot\nYeah that is that what you're referring to buy an ... [laughter]\nExactly and the other thing is that when the Senate corporations are people shouldn't they be prosecuted when they do what a corporation does something wrong should they be prosecuted like a person\nOperations or people my friend how do you put a corporation [laughter] in\nA theater throwing the city or the corporate and go\nThere you go no I agree with you Jeff as a matter of my personal opinion of course I agree with you a hundred percent I mean what do you think in my opinion of anyway\nHere's the thing it it it if the CEOs and\nActually the C O o who's if all of the cold the control group in the law they're called the control group and it makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second who can cause a corporation to do something you know who could make Exxon\nInvest in this oil well who can make Exxon decide whether to give its workers are raised who can decide whether to build a new facility here or there if you're if you're Exxon it's the control group is the chief executive officer of the chief operating officer\nBoard of directors these are the people the small group of people at the top that can cause a company to do things the janitor who's cleaning the bathrooms after hours isn't the in the control group that person doesn't do it\nSo my argument has been all along put the control group and put the whole lot of ... president all of them are ... you know that then put the board of directors in there too that will send a signal to the to everybody\nThat you got a mind your peas in choosing you got to do things right where are you going to be held accountable and and so if you just start doing some kind of group incarceration Z or I Want to have to do too many before they wake up\nExactly exactly\nWhat it what are the odds of that ever happening Jeff it's never going to have well let me ask you let me ask you how it can be made to happen\n[laughter] well if you're like eighty percent of this country started voting\n[laughter] if Bernie Sanders where president or Elizabeth Warren were president ah and we had a strong democratic uh you know group of people with a bunch of spines in the house and Senate and we had you know then ... you know that kind\nOf trickled down if I can use the phrase to the regulatory bodies right and then it could happen if we can shift to the point I've been trying to make any seemed like a smart guy so you get it\nWe can have whatever we want we really got under the United States Constitution as it exists now we can have\nWhatever we want we get a Medicare for all we can have free college we can do the transaction tax on Wall street we can do any ... any policy that any liberal or progressive is ever proposed on this show we can have it there's nothing standing in our way except Powell\nAnd to have power you need to win elections\nAnd to win elections you gotta work really hard and once you wind power you got to use it the way I look at how the Republicans are using it you got to be tough and they're tough and the Democrats don't know how to win elections they don't know what to do once they won the elections I mean it's it's sad to watch but the truth is if if if the citizenry\nDot angry enough and got aroused enough and was willing to stick with it long enough and have no short attention span and engaged in truly a you know listen to the show for example is that oh this is how the system works\nThey wouldn't need to be socialists they wouldn't need to be democratic socialist they wouldn't need to be arguing with me about Hillary's too close to Wall Street they would understand that the real key is to take over their county their village their town their city first their county\nFirst and everything beneath the county the city the village first then the state then the members of the\nHouse in the Senate and US Senate from that state\nDoes Hillary and Wall Street stuff is irrelevant the way the system works as a state based system and you take over your state and the Republicans know this look what they've done their clothes their close to having enough states under their control the ... brand new constitutional convention and if they do that we're all in very deep trouble", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Food Talk", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "29"}
