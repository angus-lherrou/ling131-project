New Jersey has had has added forty six thousand net new billionaires break or a turtle of two hundred and fifty eight thousand according to the latest data New York has added eighty four thousand new millionaires for a total of four hundred and sixty five thousand and the California\nHas added one hundred sixty nine thousand new millionaire since ... bringing the total there to eight hundred eighty five thousand in all of these high tax states the broader populations have increased as well\nSo I Would say that I'm first stuff that you are you a ... law for and a more or addressing income here and these guys are addressing net worth and there's a difference between income and network yes and I don't know you know like I I I hate apples and oranges comparison\nBut it's the same sort of thing when a somebody will talk about how the debt is Twenty one trillion dollars while I have a plan to cut the deficit and a half now those are two different thing\nYeah the deficit is um you know how much is being added to the debt the debt is how much is how oh yeah I yeah I mean you know that's these are the games that though that you know people like that play it seems obvious to me that people are moving to Texas and Florida Florida recently eclipse New York as a the third most populous state in the union I Believe\nI'm you know that's a pretty big deal and it's not because\nThe rednecks are having babies in in Florida they are but that's not the reason the reason is is because people are leaving places like uh you know Ohio Indiana I'm a you know Chicago Illinois\nThe article here continues that's not to say that rich people have left those states they have high profile image graves like David tapper\nHave left New Jersey for Florida which give outside or yeah give outsized publicity to the moves yet the high tax states are also creating the most wealth and the more new millionaires than the number who were leaving\nYeah it's big money in New York right\nIt's unclear that taxes are the chief reason for people moving from the northeast to Florida\nSure it's unclear how could it possibly be clear when the last time you pulling and who wants to write the last time you move from one state to another did anyone asked you why you moved\nUm you know though right because there are exit polls for why you've left the state even so if there was an exit poll\nPeople don't always give the reasons that are true for them right I can say that I moved to New Hampshire for a job free talk live or I could say that I Move for as a great freedom migration because New Hampshire's freedom Florida but it's not now a critic potato Institute anyway eight five five for five zero three seven three three free talk life list\nLet's talk about let's\nTalk about down home value fade into us a blue jays like you more as a kid I\n\n\nHere in the way they\nVoted down in the crowd\nWhere you need in\nDown in\nNoodle fashion comfort dime a dozen genes Everest is guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle ...

when they see and hear one lawyers know a bad witness when they see and hear one and there are ways to town\nAnd I'm really I mean given what's going on I've got to go easy on the comedy right or at least in my case the attempted comedy and and so I I I I've written down\nAnd I can hold it up on the norm came here but I'm not sure you read my chicken scratch we stream video and audio nor mangled men dot com address you know that on our website as a podcast and all that stuff nor may Goldman dot com but I what I did was I I just drew a line down the sheet of paper and on one side I wrote words that I as a lawyer\nWould use to describe doctor Christine Blasey Ford as a witness right if I were evaluating her as a witness to testify at a hearing or trial what words we use if if other lawyers other people say you know how\nDoes she do as a witness what kind of witness though she make ... ... talk to each other all the time\nSo if I put myself in in my own shoes and I was world through my lawyer eyes how would you evaluate ... witnesses who did the same thing and\nI have to confess I saw a lot less of Brett Kavanaugh I did I saw a lot less Brett Kavanaugh than I did Christine Blasey Ford I didn't see every last second them Dr Ford I saw most of it lots and lots of it\nBrett Kavanaugh's doing show prep either get beyond the norm together by the way it's about drug companies are getting competition generic drug companies get competition from the hospitals that they'd been different so that's a very interesting beyond the norm but I mean I I didn't have a lot of time\nTo spend poring over Brett Kavanaugh I did kind of dip in there might be in and out and I got it I got a really good sense I got a good sense enough of a sense and of course Krista got some really good clips and this gives you all you need to know about Brett Kavanaugh\nThe constitution gives the Senate and important role in the confirmation process but you've replaced advice and consent with search and destroy he's\nLicked cheering the senators who are there to evaluate and confirming andme advise and consent I wouldn't advise that here judge Kavanaugh don't get and here are some of the words I

call ally you don't like that in a witness when they lie because the obvious answer is All right let's get mark judge us the guy he's referring to wrote the book confessing all this stuff and let's get and put them under oath and get them here and of course mark judge and a girl friend Elizabeth razor and he confessed to hurt the stuff that everybody all the all the victims are now\nSaying so if we're going to try and get to the truth or you know there are a lot of witnesses out there who would need to be subpoenaed but obviously there are\nBrett Kavanaugh did not come across well as a witness evaluating him this is not the way you're supposed to come across you don't lecture you don't Hector you don't give people PC your mind\nYou don't get into fights with senators on and tell

good witness present how does the person present as a witness\nBy the way doctors use the same lingo Dr writing a report patient presents with the following sympathies there's just so lawyers lawyers last yes how does how does the witness present\nMy hope was that providing information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider having a serious misconduct without having to make myself my family or anyone's family\nVulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy that we have faced since they name became public\nThere you are there's Dr Ford and as we have discussed previously she tried to find a middle ground she didn't want the things that happened to her that happened to her but she didn't want to remain silent she's trying to find a middle ground to get the word out without having her name on it as we know it didn't work and so we know what happened\nLike greatest fears have been realized and their reality has been far worse than what I expected

about\nA a sixteen year old Seventeen year old whatever kid maintaining and keeping it calendar and then keeping it for thirty six years so I think a very simple thing is we the the senators should demand that copy of can demand the calendar\nTest the paper [noise] see\nIt was harder than dated [laughter] yeah you know I was I mean there there are there differences he and he made it up for weeks ago or something right ... you know they did it you know look at the ink you know and things like that I mean they can right through it to where I'm coming\nDown like ways there's all these scientific a light ways to tell us something was just created reasonably\nAnd what they should have done during the testimony is to get him to a swear that this is an actual calendar that he made it at the time remind him that he is under oath remind him that perjury\nYou know committing lying under oath is perjury which is a fellow at what potential felony you know and then remember ask him if he knows what the you know criminal penalty is for this just to get them to get that would riling up a little bit\nAnd then they find we want to see this because we are going to examine it and if it proves that that paper is not thirty six years old\nThen you're a liar didn't you didn't they already ... lying though of course but with the memos that ... that would be absolute concrete ...\nThat would stand up in a you know any kind of court not just simply he said she said\nWell what does your ... unfortunately the hearings about over and they didn't do it and they're not going to carbon date the

tribes interstates\nThat Brett Kavanaugh is very hostile do and she'd being lobbied very heavily by the native tribes and don't let this guy in because Mazie Hirono who's got native tribes in Hawaii who has been very hostile do pointed out to everybody how hostile Brett Kavanaugh's to native tribes and so we used to Murkowski would be very\nEnd as women saying these bad on on on roe versus Wade and now with all this meat to stuff that we've done here Chris Lisa Murkowski is a lot easier for her to say no than it is to say yes and the same thing is developing for Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake is out the door anyway and you know\nThe reason I don't disagree with you when Jeff Flake Jeff Flake wants to you know is looking for the nice\nBig payday when he retired he knows that if he doesn't play ball and if he angers them he's not going to get a job ... nice cushy job as a lobbyist\nChris let's leave it here I think you're jumping the gun\nBecause first of all the vote

Republicans yes forty five Democrats know there were seven remaining and that then by the way it's George W. Bush math fast forty forty five is Ninety three and I leave seven for Republicans and that's I'm putting Bob Corker in there and I probably shouldn't 'cause he's probably already are in the tank\nBut at least three Republicans the two Republican female senators Murkowski of Alaska Collins of Maine and then Jeff Flake the retirees center of Arizona and then you've got the three Democrats Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and the two Joe's one Donnelly of Indiana\nAnd one Manchin of West Virginia\nSo if if if\nIf the question is as you're presenting it\nDo you believe him or her\nRight isn't that kind of what you're saying do you after watching and listening\nDo you believe him I mean with all this with the calendar right in ... his providing his own corroborating evidence he's hanging around with the people she's identifying at the time with all the other witnesses with all the other stories with all the people are saying yeah we knew all about Brent drinking and doing all this crazy stuff back in the day\nHis own room mate man's oh price went down to me that he was a heavy drinker back then and he was doing all kinds of stuff anyway with all that\nDoesn't the question to those six or seven senators have to be do you believe her would you believe him and if you believe her how can you put him on the court isn't that where we are now Michael\n... and honestly norm my concern is that that goes back then and everyone's impressions are going to argue that that's a great job for that by that a lot of people's impression for the end of the day today is going to be\nWell you know is the NFL fans I mean he he really came out swinging that for a side coming out like you said ... aggressive yelling\nA lot of people psychology one on one tells you that that but when it was why it has something to hide but for his base and that base there there is a very persuasive so I guess we'll have to say\nWell I to me it really comes down to those that small group of senators and Here's Michael here's the way I\nView it uh at Charles Schumer the Democratic minority leader the leader of the Democrats in the Senate I I don't have facts to back this up so I have to confess that I\nDon't have facts to back this However I'm a hundred percent certain anyway that Senator Schumer has had many meetings with the Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd he's he said to them look I understand that if we get to a final final final final vote that there's a lot of pressure on you to vote for cabinet however let's make a deal\nIf the Republicans can't get him across all by themselves then will you hold back\nSee now that's the kind of way see and Schumer can give me Heidi Heitkamp she's a woman North Dakota in in a ... heavily looking democratic year you're the woman year Heidi Heitkamp as lots of political cover to say\nI'm willing to put a reasonable nominee on he's not a reasonable nominee given all that we've heard give me another the two Joes the Manchin of West Virginia and Donnelly of Indiana\nFor right now that bond is brave and we need a place that could make it home\nFrom diabetes prevention to safety around water why does the gap in fact says I\nCan't do without it\nBecause there's a wide enough that\nMethod that are really like having a role for returning talking about just listen to Nick and Vicki

[noise]\nThe why for better or [noise]\nVows now the time to make a difference\nNow's the time to take a stand to get involved to make a change now that I'm going to raise a hammer and\nAnd open a

sixteen minutes ago breaking news\nSenators Collins of Maine Murkowski of Alaska and fleet them Arizona Manchin of West Virginia are meeting they're having a meeting\nAs a sixteen minutes ago according to CNN now these are ... are those are four of the seven that I've identified as swing centers and they were all identify those wings Sanders\nThe fate of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nSits in the hands of seven senators I'm including Bob Corker of Tennessee and I may be tempted to remove him and miss making three and three on on each side however that it appears to me and certainly from looking for a political point of view that if there was going to be\nA Scott pulling a getting rid of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the way it would be most likely to happen\nIs a group\nOf democratic and Republican senators\nAll together join hands and leap\nRight that we not one of them can be blamed as being the boat that that prevent the cabinet oh you want to stop cabin\nAll right this way if you've got six in let's say the six three Republican three Democrats and and it's the usual suspects right and they all come out and they hold a press conference and they say look we can't do it we're not doing it and so the six of us who just not voting for Brett Kavanaugh so forget it he's done that way\nYou'd have to blame all six of them and it's by partisan 'cause you'd have three and three if Brett Kavanaugh's going down\nThat seems to me the most likely political exit route so this way the politicians spread the blame they don't get into trouble individually that way you don't have the the John McCain optics right so Senator McCain you remember Senator McCain walking up was some down and then Benedict I was walking around the White House impersonating him hey ball I Am forgotten about jibe ball\nI'm Sorry so or if I was talking about the calendar somebody who keeps a calendar and I do I keep a workout calendar\nEven at that age he says I cross things off if I didn't if I didn't lift weights across it up I Would think it'd be very important\nThat you would put it in other words lift weights which will write a my spreadsheet for my for my daily walking I put down how far how long it took me a log in what time I got it if I didn't go down rain a well maybe I was sick whatever\nA reason why I didn't go and so forth across things off with no notation as to why seems a little bit funny\nThing is I don't think so angry angry is innocent person I've ever seen but the part that was of norm was when he said towards the end you on the other side to uh put me through this and ruin my wife I may never change our coach basketball I can\nAnd I thought you know what I'm Talking about well water sniffling it'll create to say that as if I have a right to be challenged to take the highest court in the bench alive\nCourt in Atlanta sense of entitlement that's why he to me he's in the lead us prep school brat now not every person that goes to her to prep schools new leaders rats but he is he is some portion are and he qualifies any real well you know that he was known for\nEver lawyer when you're listening [laughter] I I had to feeling first me think out of protest too much you got to watch evidence you're ... you're having too much you're telling you got from a Nineteen eighty two covered here I mean there's no there's no room for you know there is\nTelling me to watch and then he went into all kinds of things about football practice and his heart I mean it was just like\nThis is irrelevant and doesn't speak to me it was so destructive I didn't feel I can help many courses attitude was so hostile\nThe problem is you you got it and you got it from the start which is if your innocent\nYou don't go on the offensive you do all these people names you don't lecture them and yell at them and the temp to bully your weight pass them on to your job and the Supreme Court\nNo if you're innocent if you're being wrong you do what Dr Ford did and you said you said please investigate I Will be exonerated I Will be only too happy\nTo cooperate in fact let me name forty eight witnesses here who could just I mean his approach was the approach of a guilty man\nIs approach was the approach of a guy who\nCarefully concocted at tactical base strategy of getting his way on he did the Roy Cohn thing to Benedict Arnold thing of\nBest

I'm trying to remember but go ahead of me please continue all ...\nOkay well we'll see she was trying to say that white women in this country I have a a real\nNow I remember almost [laughter] okay with the way that\nThey they they fight back against white male supremacy in abuse here in this country and and you kind of just brushed it off like well don't paint and every one with a broad\nPartially because I didn't learn out there on I was not the part I was reacting to the part I was reacting to his wishes that you got to bed down with these men and I was like wait a second I\nI Am she was going off in this direction that I just I didn't think was pregnant frankly\nAnd and to me to me well back at what I you know Peter ... remember being struck FBI guy Benedict went after him Louie Gohmert whom I've got a perfect name Louie Gohmert in a congressional hearing said to him how do you look in your wives eyes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Food Talk", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "01"}
