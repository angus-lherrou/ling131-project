be here a lot you probably have a face if not you could drop right out of your mother ship you know in space or whatever but if you're going to be\nActive here for whatever your interest are you going to have to have a base in the best place to have bases down way down deep into the bedrock or down in the underground than the bottom of the oceans and whatever so that you don't uh affect the

information and they and they and he had this meeting and it was the corporate lawyers and they wanted to know where he's got the information from and whatever so it's locked up and and what I consider without talked about it in my politics book there's a kind of a a good a good for the ...\nOf of of of of all of a lead interest than corporation that basically control this whole matter they ... they control the need to know who drove the classification system\nAnd the corporate lawyers up at the top work with all these corporations that is that this that determined that special access

don't especially in the area of criminal justice reform because nobody cares about convicts yeah mostly than in any way going on here\nI'm a cell phone is gonna sooner usher in a series of do criminal justice reform Eight Belles dealing with everything from police accountability to juvenile detention are now on the desk of governor Jerry Brown and they'll become law if he doesn't veto them by Sunday\nAnd uh my understanding is of each other any of these so I'm a we'll just go on here it's not clear which bills you may signed but advocates of the criminal justice reform are hopeful about the proposals passed by California's Democrat controlled legislature\nIt's noteworthy and look I I don't like Democrats I don't like Republicans but for me in the area of criminal justice reform I feel like Democrats are trying a little harder for Republicans to there's no there's no traction there within the or the right side of the spectrum or to try new things\nAnd I think that most people would agree what I've heard numbers as high as eighty five percent of adults um coming out of prison are likely to re offend and return to the prison system that's pretty pretty scary stuff it's obviously something's not\nWorking well what are the things I've thought for a long time is that our criminal justice system has turned into sort of an exile in place system where even after\nYou get out of prison it becomes almost impossible to find employment because of your record it becomes very difficult to find\nA place to live because if you record so then people are more likely to turn back to crime because they can no longer live in society at all and it has become this sort of alternative to president senators is to ruin a person's life forever and while I Do think that people who commit crimes should be punished especially depending on what the crime is some of them are pretty bad\nYou have to also think people need to be able to put their lives together and move on so we need to get rid of this whole exile in place system that I think is contributing to re citizen right and\nI remember and it's been a long time since I've heard anybody say this but uh there's some kind of saying of well they've served their time so they should be allowed to be a full member of society but\nNow with all of these things as you mentioned uh a lot of apartments now have a question on the application do you have a criminal record a lot of job applications now have questions have you ever been convicted of a crime\nIt used to say have you been convicted of a felony in the last seven years which um since I got out of prison after eight and a half years the answer to that would have been no\nRight which would have to go apply for a job now you would say that the vast majority of those applications or have you\nEver been convicted of a crime right and I can't so\nYou know I haven't been at but it's filled out a job application of Fifteen Years or\nSomebody that say sixteen years old petty shoplifting and gets charged as an adult for the rest of their life they're going to have to mark that box and then explain to their potential employer about that thing that happened Twenty years ago\nI'm not entirely clear so you know certainly in New York giving legal advice here whether one if one is convicted I'm as sentenced as useful offender or whether they have to reveal or if they're a juvenile whether they have to reveal\nWell I said charged as an adult okay sixteen year old charred citizen adult probably need a lot of times depending on you know what the crime was is very likely\nAnd if this is different from the trend in a lot of the the other first of all countries which is in places like the u._k. and Germany in Australia\nMinor offenses drop off the record after ten years and in those countries they are legally allowed to answer no to the question have you ever been arrested if it's a minor offense like a misdemeanor whereas in the United states it follows you around to the rest of your life even if it's something small\nTwelve years sounds reasonable still sounds long but honestly if somebody has been you know so yeah if it's been whatever period of I'm Sorry ten years if what if bin whatever period of time I mean if somebody's been was convicted of something heinous them when they were Seventeen years old like I was\nUm I mean at what point does it not matter anymore I mean you're you're sixty five you're you're you're filling up Social Security forum does it matter I mean I don't know it seems like it's not worth a not worth taking a look at\nThe end immigration I mean sometimes I deal with people who are in admissible for criminal grounds for things that they did literally Thirty years ago\nRight happens yeah and ... well how do they bring out of the ... has this judge react to that when you're dealing with a situation like that\nWell sometimes they're not even eligible to apply for a waiver so if you have somebody who was convicted of cocaine possessions for Thirty years ago they are permanently not allowed to enter the United states even if they're married to a U.S citizen so it's really really

we do have a a couple of them waiting on I Want to tell you I looked at this uh California prisoners rights thing and\nI I mean they're they're pretty flimsy as far as rights because it's not like this is the right to uh you don't have a prostitute brought in to you every uh every other week on Thursday\nUm it's a lot but probably shouldn't even mentioned that as I'm going to read what the rights are but that is not one of them\nAll right so the the right to purchase receive and read any and all the newspapers periodicals and books except for distribution the United states post office obviously they can't have a and then they go on you can't have anything to do with inciting riots an arson and murder and things like that\nCan't be obscene and variety of any thing like that so\nAnd of course they had to fight a say in the water and just know that when he sees that\nIndeed uh that's that's up to the courts but that's basically the first thing the second thing is to initiate civil actions subject two or three dollar filing for you to be collected by the department of corrections in addition to so they can file a court case they can get married\nThey can create a power of appointments I mean anybody in a hospital can do that to make a will they can receive all benefits provided to whatever the labor codes other there's that covered in the the labor code to some extent they can\nConvey real property from one person to another or it could have written and artistic material that can correspond confidentially with their attorney or correspond with other people I mean these aren't\nLike [laughter] all inmates in the United states have rights the rights that are afforded to Californian and mates don't seem to be particularly\nAmazing speaking as a person who was in prison\nRight and you know it's important that they mentioned the right to confidentially correspond\nSpecifically with an attorney yeah because you know in some cases and I think the the place that I've worked as a corrections officer Eighteen years ago they had somebody that monitored all telephone calls\nAnd the ah visitation rooms were monitored\nSo you know ain't nothing confidential happening there but if there was an interaction with an attorney I don't remember if they had ... national room for the I don't remember if they did it again it's been Eighteen years and that wasn't the area that I worked in\nA bit you know it is important to be able to confidentially talk to your attorney that way somebody's not then going\nTelling the prosecutor well yeah this is what this guy was talking to his attorney about\nJust go to Matthew calling in from Louisiana Matthew you're on free sock life\nYou're talking about a ah\nIf I may digress what I originally called about talking about life after prison I Know a couple of people who are sex offenders they might as well just kept them in person\nYeah it's rough on sex offender specifically and one like\nThis is the saying that I it's it's it's one of those truism you know I say you can't take bad people\nPut them in a bad place with other bad people treat them badly for a period of time and then expect them to get out and act good\nUm I happen to be one of these ah and I'm at the poster child for the correctional system out there I'm you know I turned around and all that stuff but\nA lot of these people they're still bitter and the you know these kinds of things and I am more punishment isn't what's going to make their lives is in what's going to turn them around\nAnd in regard to the sex offenders some of the stuff that I've read is that that's part of the increase in the homeless population yeah is that sex offenders they can't get where they can't live anyplace\nAnd the downside of them being homeless because I Know some of the listeners may be saying well there are sex offenders you know who cares if they're homeless who cares about that right well the thing about them being homeless is then they can't be tracked then it's very difficult to know where they are then they do you know even though these rules about where they can live\nIs designed so that they don't go near schools are places where vulnerable people are if they're homeless you can't stop them from going there you don't know if they're they're so basically in the end it didn't do any good\nPlus they um ended up collecting in certain housing areas so um it has to sort of the opposite effect the worst is there something worse than a sex offender and that's a large group of sex offenders together do you really want these people getting together and making plans\nI mean if that's what you think they do is getting in vans in rural trolling for kids imagine if there's two or three of them and they can work together\nAnd I don't have all the magic ancestor what to do with sex offenders it's a very difficult problem but just making it so that they can't live anyplace isn't isn't working and if I go ahead Alan\n... the biggest challenge that they have is that they keep ... bad the definition of what caused it it's just so bad and if you go to work at the ADA you look up sexual assault\nA solo realized on the sexual assault scared to death okay all the way you are called though has to do with the oil industry and did you hear that if he a as remove the permissible\nLimit of zero from radioactive material\nUm no\nThis is going to be a boon for us it well oil mind aboard yes okay or as far as all the steel bodies in the ground absorbs the background radiation from New York okay under the previous administration uh it was\n... one two three radioactive Jewish cycle even though it's noble radioactive\nJobs you know has been something that I've ...\nMaybe I stand corrected and I don't have the data and that's\nWhy we've got robot to manufacture than in the United states because uh uh the labor laws and the U.S make it difficult to manufacture stuff so um you know use unionized labor as difficult to deal with and it's just significantly cheaper to have a robot do the job\nYeah actually that's the only thing that's happening is a lot of the manufacturing jobs that went to China are now coming back to the United states because of automation so there are being more jobs created in the U.S but it's not going to be those lower level unskilled labor jobs if people who know how to manage the robots and there's not going to be as many as they were before but we are seeing them return\nIt but the unemployment as low as it's ever been um ... I mean you know there's an opportunity to work there is an opportunity to work on skilled I'm ... you could still complain about your job you don't have to have a manufacturing job and get with other people to complain about your job you could you could get a job waiting tables and complain about that um everybody loves a good ... waiter\nSo I'm kind of not lost their well\nThe the idea of being in any case it's like you know it's it's not just a simple matter of you know people have this\nNasty tendency to reduce the spends too well you know it's you're you're imposing terrorists therefore your not for free trade or you're not sure\nIf it comes to yeah\nYeah All right so um I have a trade deficit with a Wal Mart target a Home Depot a whole variety of places I've got a trade deficits all over the place the people that buy my products or a you know in my case that's a radio ads\nUm the by my products and services are generally not the people with whom I have a trade deficit they have a trade deficit with me it's the network a Web of buying and selling and you don't necessarily have to have a a a fair a fair agreement in order for everybody to benefit\nWhen somebody buys something they don't buy it because they consider the price to be fair\nThey buy it because they consider the price to be\nUm acceptable to be cheap I'd rather give I'd rather have\nThis ten dollars that I Would a Twinkie however I might rather have a Twinkie than a dime so it comes down to pricing and when you let the free market work it'll be fine so\nUp against that can't well\nWell that that's a fine theory except that you're not dealing with a with a free market a good example is in Mexico was putting a Fifteen Percent in court terrible on basically everything that came out of the United states and then we're allowing Mexico to a ... and and there's no tear up on Mexican imports right\nAnd so you've got you've got a one way conveyor belt of resources out of the country and then on the other end of that you're subsidizing an invasion of immigration you got one way conveyor belt resource it out of the country a one-way conveyor belt to\nBuying those things if they cost Fifteen Percent more um in Mexico then the the resources aren't leaving the United states or the resources leaving Mexico 'cause they're cheap here\nI'm Talking about the money actually sell like ...\n... ... there's no there's no there's no trade reciprocity being created they're okay and so you're living a tray\nYou want it with your market Mexico doesn't have a whole bunch of money there even if it was even if it was subsidized in whatever way that you know the Mexican market isn't going to spend that much more because they just don't have that much\nBut yet you know the truth of the matter is is every time Donald Trump talks about we're going to get a trade deal it he says if and if not even better right\nThe truth of the matter is you know in the states like we do not need to deal with the rest of the world we don't want to right which is why Trump has so much negotiating power under his belt like you've got to say like I'm a great negotiator and I'm sure yeah\nBut you don't have to be when you're the United states everybody wants to sell stuff to us and we and actually we don't need everybody else right and so\nWhen they come in they should've\nTrade isolationism\nBut when they when they come in when Mexican Mexican products or come in to the United states\nThey because they the ... like manufacturing costs is lower it lowers the price of drives down the price of American uh goods and services which is good for Americans who are making those things I'm like I'm not manufacturing anything so I therefore get the benefit of paying less\nFor any particular product\nRight unless you're a ... has been destroyed by the trade policy in which case you are going to stop or uh in in some other ... right and so\nIs that a paint a picture\nOf my my my upcoming doom\nWell the trade deficits matter when you're talking about stopping entities and I forget exactly the mechanics by Peter Schiff has explained the trade deficit drive up the national debt okay\nAnd so like when we're when we're living on a trade deficit we're we're we're living on an artificially high standard of living which the United states is sort of had this habit of doing the monetary policy borrowing and everything else right that's one of the ways\nThat we have been doing that and eventually it has to get fixed right and so you know it has not come home to roost just yet but you know you're actually run out of the ability to do that\nWell Americans are spending more than they make again uh they did that in two thousand and five and then two thousand and six at a a\nReally unpleasant surprise for them um Americans are spending more than they make again\nAnd if you want to put in place a safeguards for people to act appropriately\nUm you know I suppose you can do that he could Danny state the world if you want you can put a you can you can round the the the hard edges and soften things up I however or have learned the lesson of spending frivolously and would prefer to just enjoy the low prices well\nI think it's good when I there's a competition with the American products that makes the American products become less expensive I think when it starts to become a problem is when the foreign products make it so that it's no longer financially reasonable for us to produce that product at all and then we started to become dependent\nOn their side there's aren't toasters you can buy in the United states is I I've read some articles someplace you just can't buy American manufactured toaster there are no more all this is what happens\nAnd the toaster did not end of the world right but you look at something like you don't like a nation need the steel industry right it's important for national very important for a lot of different reasons right and so China will go and subsidizes the other big dumped all over here to prevent us from having a steel industry\nRight and then once they get to the point where they got their control over the marketplace and they can do whatever they want with the price you know\nAnd so I find that type of thing we don't\nHave we don't need to be manufacturing brightly colored plastic garbage a like a lot of crap that gets imported from China right but you know there are things that we do require um as a society that we can't produce them by ourselves and we will reliant upon foreign entities in Paris one way to preserve goes in\nAnd one of the examples would be the transformers the electrical transformers for the electrical grid we no longer produce those in the United states at all they have to be imported from Germany and I forget what there's Japan or Korea so in the event that we need a transformer we can't make it here at all\nYou gotta watch out for these Germans never know I think for the call

New York will continue for some time\nCorrespondent polo San Deval reports the NTSB calls it the deadliest transportation related accident since February of two thousand nine\nNumber right and again in some cases never even participate\nMostly it yeah they they've got charges like accomplice principle they have charges for this we don't need ... to yeah we we don't particularly need this charge in order to be able to sentence people correctly we've got we've got this covered folks\nRight but see a lot of times they wind up doing this charge stacking up thing of all well they fit the a criteria for this this this and then you wind up with five or ten different charges and then that's where the police come in\nWhere we'll start playing let's make a deal All right so we've got ten charges are new will drop three of these if you played to the others and then I Know you should wind up facing a hundred years in prison will just say five years call it call it a good day\nWell I think that's a plea bargaining can certainly end up with people getting the right amount of time it can make it ended up with them getting fined sentencing and all that but in many cases people who\nAre not guilty take plea bargains simply because the system isn't even set up anymore to give trials right far fewer\nFar fewer than one percent of arrests result in a trial and that's it it isn't it it's no longer a CSI out there are people you know I I don't know what the shows are that actually have trials or some Perry Mason you know and\nThese people think things have changed that law and order and there are any more that people aren't going to trial\nRight and there's a podcast that I listen to wrongful conviction with Jason ... and something that has been repeated throughout numerous interviews that he's done is the criminal justice system that we have is completely screwed up to where if you say I'm guilty\nYou get to go home if you say I didn't do this you go to prison for the rest of your life\nYeah that's a real mess is that I mean statistically some of the people that are arrested by our find boys and blew out there are not guilty right because humans make mistakes and that's the reason we have a criminal justice system\nWhat's happened is over the course of two hundred and forty years of bureaucracy is that prosecutors are law enforcement judges these people have figured out ways to get around\nHaving to do their jobs and give somebody a trial admittedly not all trials are fair\nBut um you know they [laughter] they they deserve to have one innocent people to me the more likely to take a case to trial but it's about two thirds of people who take eight felony conviction a felony charge to trial ended up convicted right and that's a mess\nThat there is also a lot of people that will uh take what's called an Alford plea which is something that I had not heard of until a couple of years ago and it's something that I'm guessing a lot of other people have not heard up so what an Alford plea is is that where you say\nYou have enough evidence to convict me but I Am not saying that I Am\nGuilty right as I said no contest they are no contest and you know that that's the play and then some cases there won't be an adjudication of guilt necessarily with the er the sentence 'em so you know\nTo having dealt with a lot of people you know and I do immigration I don't do criminal stuff a lot of my ... in a certain number of my clients have convictions and I would say most of them almost all of them pleaded guilty it's very rare for me to see anybody who actually went to trial on and I think I've only had one who pleaded no contest\nAt the truth is most of them actually did it but I'm a rarely I have seen people who in my opinion once I listen all the facts I did not think that they were guilty I've seen it a couple of times\nI like the the term Fifteen Percent um but that's\nJust that's I've learned to fly out there but I have also seen I've had very few are very wealthy clients who've been accused of criminal activity and I would say if you have a lot of money you're not going to get convicted\nUnless like you were really really stupid and there's tons and tons of evidence to the whole justice system is definitely skewed I'm so that people who have a lot of money are far for my more likely to get away with stuff than anybody else\nYeah that's the that's the truth there is no way to avoid that let's go to Sara calling in from New Mexico Sara you're on TALK live\nLike in that call and I I you know by the bacteria

Seventy to eighty is considered borderline they're not actually mentally disabled mentally disabled has blessed to have any\nSo um one thing I can say is is that ah obviously people mature at different speeds\nSo if we use this term Eighteen as adults a majority age um then one would presume and ended by the way they mature in different ways that different speech so that you can physically mature you could have a a mature sense of I dunno mathematics but not a particularly mature sense of uh you know right and wrong or whatever\nUm you know I didn't I almost I I went through my juvenile career in high school and I never got caught for anything I ever did\nThe first crime that I was ever convicted of was the crime that I went to prison for\nAnd I got to say that if I had been caught doing some you know skipping lunch line or something um you know probably would have been a little more mature but I just kept on feeling like I could get away with things so I think that to some extent that's the maturity anyway all I'm saying or will go on here are talking about this and we'll see what with ... with about it\nSo I I'm trying to find what the IQ was of Rickey re rector guys that name sounds familiar to either of you know he was executed in Nineteen Ninety two\nIn Arkansas when Bill Clinton was the governor alright Ricky re rector for his last meal did not eat his dessert and when asked he said oh I'll come back at it that when we're done with the thing\nHe had no clue that he was about to die clearly\nExecuted and he was considered like mentally competent yeah so I mean that's\nObviously a mistake he shouldn't have stood trial at all because he's clearly not competent\nBut obviously when people don't stand trial they're not getting away with it right there not just saying up well too dumb to ah to handle this so let's just let them back out on the streets say\nRight it's basically what you're describing somebody ... who genuinely doesn't understand like if you have somebody who's mentally disabled and they take something from the store you know while their mom isn't looking and you know even if it's an adult he doesn't understand that that stealing so he doesn't understand that he's done anything wrong so he wouldn't be standing trial because he doesn't he doesn't he's not competent\nI Can't you can't defend themselves but I I'm sure that some dumb Douglas have committed murder in the past and those people should go to mental hospitals I'm to be to live out the rest of their lives I'm not saying they should get away with anything right the same time my\nMy point is that there there are rules on the books that are supposed to prevent this from happening there yes\nPeople are supposed to evacuate people are going to slip through and I don't think it but there is the rules so creating the rule isn't going to solve the problem yeah because it already exists\nAnd I tend to not lose too much sleep over people with low IQ's that kill people getting executed\nI don't know if he did or not I'm just saying that I tend not to lose sleep all that it's a great story [laughter] my shoe [laughter] I'm great as an absolutely horrible well it's great because it illustrates um you know that some people are clearly not a understanding what's going on\nRight now and there's actually a Supreme Court case that the court heard arguments I think a week and a half ago about a guy that it's in a death row in Alabama\nHe's had several strokes over the years that he's been on death row I think it's been close to thirty now\nAnd he has severe dementia has no recollection of the crime that happened or why he has incarcerated church and so the Supreme Court is going to have to decide whether or not he can be executed for the crime\nYeah this is another issue the prisons are having to deal with is is that because longer sentences are being implemented um and you've got people who committed crimes in their twenties and teens right now uh you know heading up into their seventies and eighties\nUh uh yeah I it's it's a more and more prisons are having to confront what to do with the geriatric inmates and it used to be they just kick them out because statistically if you released everybody at the age of twenty seven\nThe likelihood of them recon a recon committing is low\nBut um you know they they don't do that because the notion is is that somehow legislators who came up with the sentencing guidelines do best as to how long somebody should be in prison honestly it's different for everybody and that if you want if if you if you care about anything like\nRehabilitation then you know that's a that's a different period of time for everybody and right I don't think a parole board could even figure that out of your race\nAnd there is kind of two fold the way that mandatory minimum sentencing came about it came about because some politicians were quote unquote upset that certain judges were giving certain people different sentences for the same crime\nAnd they also wanted to be able to tell their constituents are tough on crime\nAnd if you look at the uh the graph of prison population you will see that in the early to mid Nineteen eighties what's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines came in and they just start going straight up\nYeah all of them and the ... and the crime rate went down to those at the same time so it's causation and correlation we don't know maybe this system of throw them all away um and throw away the key\nMaybe at the ... maybe it's reduce crime but on a world wide scale crimes reduced to and they don't all have the same policies the United states so right the U.S\nHas a what is it a twenty five percent of all and may it's been only five percent of the human population\nYeah the uh the incarceration rate in the United states per capita as a remarkably higher than it is and other countries\nAnd some of the reduction in the crime rate to simply has to do with an aging population and so you know we mentioned before\nAnd that's the most of the crimes are committed by meals between the ages I think Fifteen and twenty seven Jeff and so as the you know we become an older average age in the population you would expect to see the crime rates go down\nThe Senate bill Thirteen or Ninety One would prohibit prosecutors from recommending that fourteen and Fifteen year olds be tried and sentenced as adults\nCurrently teens this age you commit certain serious crimes to be transferred to adult courts with a judge's approval once and they don't system they could face when the synthesis even prison life in prison and I got to say I saw that\nAnd [noise] it doesn't say much about most the or the ability to reform um you know the idea that our justice system give us the ability to reform if you're putting a fourteen year old in prison for life eight five five four or five zero three seven three three it's eight fifty five four fifty normal blood pressure naturally how would

situation at the beginning of the next hour because we've got a really important situation going on here with the U.S Supreme\nCourt and to finish my present patient in my view of the Republican Party they would simply there they would be so incensed at what we've just witnessed if if we change one factor versus and it was a Democratic president who got in with two point eight million less votes right I mean it just no\nFacts change except one\nDemocratic president Democratic Senate fifty one forty nine jamming through somebody with all these allegations you know the Republicans would be apoplectic I have the best words they would\nBe so melting as a best were they will be the right and so\nYou know they would go and destroy the U.S Supreme Court and here's how they would do it they attack it's legitimate ... the Supreme Court does not have a police force right there are U.S Marshals right I mean the the the U.S Marshal Service been around since Seventy nine ah but the ... how are they gonna where how are they going to do\nThe Supreme Court lives\nOn our acceptance of its legitimacy and the Republicans know that Mitch McConnell knows it and now you and I know and so\nIf this situation were reversed and there were you know Democratic president jam and democratic or judges on here after holding a seat open with a Republican president boy they would have freaked out right think about this the situation just flip a Democrats or Republicans Merrick Garland right withheld for a year the Republicans\nWould go after the Supreme Court and the legitimize\nThey would they would have infiltrators saying you're not you're not a real court they wouldn't call him chief justice Roberts right they would do everything they would it would be like South Carolina before the civil war passing\nResolutions of nullification single federal laws don't apply on our land this is where the Republicans have taken us they're getting us back\nTo the question of what does it mean to be an American\nAnd what does it mean to be America\nAnd ... over there kept\nPlaying and by the way he didn't do this boot and didn't do this the Republicans started this is my president Obama was inaugurated when Mitch McConnell got 'em all together and you know that meeting the night President Obama became President Obama January twenty two thousand I there was a Republican leaders meeting and they said we will obstruct everything\nRight and you remember what they did during President Obama's turn okay well boot and said hey\nI'm a turbo charged that the he hijacked their movement he he joined in with them and they know it and they joined in within the Republican Party has the lead with Russia and I'm Don Donald Trump is food and stop it and here's where we are so\nSeems to me if the Democrats want to do something other than accept red cabin on the Supreme Court forget about impeachment forget it because the word appeasement does not mean removal okay in removal means two things to things impeachment announcing and remove all by the Senate you\nNeed sixty seven and it ain't happening so if you want to get rid of him I'm Sorry you're going to have to do with the Republicans were doing hound him out of office and I mean how look what the Republicans would do\nThey would not let the Supreme Court functioned they would disrupted they would deny the legitimacy of its rulings they would be in the public I always just throwing battery acid on the court saying these are legitimate this so called court you know it and I know\nNo one else John Boehner knows it to you know and I know what we all know so\nIf you want to do something about it my suggestion would be do what the Republicans do however I don't see it happening Democrats are like Republicans Democrats are not at all like Republicans so what do you do\nMy thanks for calling from Chicago Hi am I\nPaying our by you doing\nI'm I'm getting through the day what's on your mind\nOkay first of all I'm gonna just come out say I'm a Republican or scarred let's talk about America early or number of Nineteen Ninety to Joe Biden on the Senate floor sitting president as last year should not nominate Supreme Court let the voters decide\nHe said that he got he said it right he said and when did I had to wait no no no no no there's\nNo way go way you're going to have a conversation with me or we're going to not do this okay here goes Joe Biden said it didn't do it Mitch McConnell went and did it okay here's my question to you and I'll give you back the airways is it only for presidents or does it apply the senators to\nGo ahead\nWell this is a presidential year no no no no no no no no ... does the rule that no lame ducks put Supreme Court justices on is that only\nThe president's where was it only is it for senators and presidents are only presidents because your say you were saying that Joe Biden saying this in Ninety two sat there and then okay rate Mitch McConnell then wouldn't follow the rules I'll go along with you one of those great so does it apply to senators to\nReplies that would be really great and why is Jeff Flake and Orrin Hatch and Bob Corker voting for this guy they can't they disqualified from the Joe Biden Mitch McConnell rules and you just agreed with me\nActually shut shorts at the same thing is two thousand eight\nSo great ... so we're all on a favorite so we're on the same page if you're a lame duck president or you were a lame duck senator you can't participate in the process of putting a Supreme Court justice on because the rule is lame ducks don't leave lifetime judge just behind\nRight okay that's great so we're not so good bye\nTo Brett Kavanaugh so you're gone and so with Brett Kavanaugh you just through Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court\nYou're you're such a troll you're so interested in being a ... not that you just lost the argument bro on the merits here's what you should have said if you were if you were a better role than that what you would have said was known on it only applies the president's this president's peck sent me the only\nDevices that can sense and my response would have been\nIt takes two in the U.S constitution it takes to\nTo get someone on the Supreme Court they are constitutionally equivalent a president to nominate but as we saw with Merrick Garland it doesn't work that way if the Senate doesn't do its part right it takes two to tango so if we're talking about\nThe lame ducks leaving lifetime Supreme Court judges on there is no logical commonsense\nReason why it doesn't apply to US Senators the only reason it's being applied to president says because right now Republicans\nThe control and they want them to stop Obama and Jim this do through so they were OK with a lame duck senators like Orrin Hatch of Utah Jeff Flake of Arizona Bob Corker of Tennessee that's three if the if the McConnell\nBiden Obama rule applied Merrick Garland I'm Merrick Garland forgetting are gone with this current do Kavanaugh wouldn't\nBe there might if you're going to troll me you're gonna have to do better Joe thanks for calling from Cleveland\nWe're we're all in this together you can't be in it when it's good for you
