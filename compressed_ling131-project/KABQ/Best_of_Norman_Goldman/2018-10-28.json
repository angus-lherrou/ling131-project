settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and in payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a new account specifically for those\nAre the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through was notified by the bank or something to mail a return on a stock payment on a second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet\nA now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a ... new center to all the different\nDepartments and how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or ... days or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time\nFor all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just I ...\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement huh that no we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance\nSo we settled that and they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company correct they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nNo end to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually\nHad to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question\nAnd then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost there you go okay\nWell you'll get paid more guy it's it that's world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh I hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine ... thirty nine home or we when we bought a house um were was given a or excuse me a fiancee and are\nThat are limited what we could do a lot and what we could do with our home\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that\nEach of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura or the city approve the flooding of the lot and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of that the sea and are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our records\nThe record on you and what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the actual weight also can control\nAnd they can say no more than one lied or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the ... but you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always\nOkay so you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them All right max\nHi good morning for yes or buy insurance claim a horse [laughter] okay\nBut yes you have trouble with an insurance company\nYeah I never heard that one before ever I'm an accident much of that yeah that's what\nThis is while asking [noise] anyway uh anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of space committed they shorted me eight hundred and Ninety seven dollars\nYeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go pound it said that it anyway um anyway what I did I filed in small claims court trade are there and maybe seven dollars and immediately came with a check for five hundred\nBanned the verbiage on the checks if I pick a check or that negates credit for claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I take a check because I Know I picked her button court if I take that check 'cause negate to yeah yeah\nBecause that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sell is jak then I Will not go after you I have all my rights absolutely okay so the only way you can go and kick their body is to say no thank you to the Jack and boy had and file in small claims court and keep their what\nOkay that's that's where I'm gonna\nGo good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a\nJudge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge a well he's a small claims judge which are usually not judges hug and daddy is and this happens all the time with the company's immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nLike dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair

Wasserman Schultz says the return address in some cases police are also investigating a suspicious package sent to former vice president Joe Biden and a suspicious package found today at actor Robert

came in a package address to John Brennan all of the targets have been vilified by President Trump in the past authority said it remains unclear if the bomb devices were opera bombs or designed to look like bombs no one's been hurt by the devices assault comes less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nOn Wednesday afternoon President Trump described the attempted bombing as quote

the media also has a responsibility to stop the endless sue the constant\nNegative and oftentimes false attacks insurers have to do\nThe Wisconsin rally President Trump did not name any of the Democrats\nTargeted a earlier this morning a Trump went on Twitter quote and wrote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nAnd I'd gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast said Trump\nTrump has a long record of attacking CNN and inciting violence last\nYear he tweeted a video showing him tackling on punching a figure with a CNN logo over its face\nOn Wednesday CNN presidents ... blasted President Trump saying quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks\nUm he made his way after getting out of prison out out to the west coast and ultimately settled down in San Clemente a in South Orange County and um\nHe and several other folks from from this area for him to rise above a couple of years ago at him in part as a result of their presence at rallies where they kind of formed the identity of being kind of the street fighter type folks that were going to defend\nPeople's rights to free speech uh they they're a group that really a has focused on the idea of of training physical training they do a lot of them in a training they they were actually just completed a European Tour where they\nMet with far right extremists across Europe including Russia with a leading MA a neo Nazi group called a white rex\nUm they do a lot of cross training so they really promote this idea of healthy lifestyle and that they're kind of a opposed to this kind of contemporary decadent culture and lifestyle that's being promoted by\nKinda multiculturalism so they're very Xena phobic an anti immigration or they have links to a much older white supremacist groups like the hammer skin nation which has been one of the largest neo Nazi skinhead groups across the globe since the late eighties\nSo uh they're definitely part of this you no longer traditions of white supremacist group that has a long history here in orange county\nSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday at President Trump I'm a ... I wanted to turn into a video I'm a that comes from frontline\nI'm at a video that describes\nWhat really what we're talking about\nNew generation of white supremacists are pushing their politics into the mainstream Rob\nRuined do seem to be part of that trend\nGroups first public appearance wasn't at a torch march\nIn Huntington Beach pro Trump rally behind a manner that red offend America\nOne member also attacked\nA journalist with the orange county's alternative weekly paper at the time did you know that this was a group or who did this or or what was going on\nNo I definitely saw their organized they suck as a group you know the also the banner one I got back to the office and I started talking to stall about everything you start having to go out and look for everybody there who who was attacking people\nAre going to hashtags but like hashtags mega march of last few yeah right there are so for like this was this him hitting you is that or is that later this is right after he had just hitting me\nWhen I clicked on his name it took me to his profile\nAnd you look at his pictures their ... and you say oh that's the due to attack there you go\nThat's an excerpt in the race and PBS Frontline documentary titled documenting hate Charlottesville the clip began with A.C Thompson of ProPublica\nWho helped expose a rise above move than ten we were just listening to Frank ... and a reporter with the ah Orange County alternative weekly paper talk more about that\nYeah um so you know this is the you know the the the the investigative work the ProPublica has done a exposing a rise above than in others as well it's been extremely important in terms of trying to shut a light that otherwise seems to have been\nKind of ignored to to a large extent which has been part of the problem that my German was discussing earlier I'm a few moments ago\nAnd I also want to mention something if you look at rise above in their propaganda they they have been a pretty adept at creating a glossy videos that show them train and doing graffiti and and and then also having clips of some of their physical violence at some of these rallies\nThey are very clear about identifying themselves as a nationalist\nAnd so it's an interesting point that President Trump a just a couple of days ago at the at a rally in Texas made a point to the dental find yourself as a national lessons so I think this is important to underscore the lot of these groups like rise above they don't neo Nazis or white supremacist they call themselves national is oftentimes\nThey call themselves nationalist very interesting that you should say that considering yes this week I'm at a at the Houston rally at President Trump is holding these campaign rallies across the country he called himself a national yeah\nYeah I mean it's it's for folks like rise above that's music to their ears because that word means a lot to them\nAnd they really see that as an important in a way of defining themselves are that can be potentially more palatable to a larger percentage of of the population especially a white Americans who won't\nBe as likely to be turned off by for instance a term like neo Nazi where you have folks it might be a little bit intimidated by that term so groups like rise above are very very adept at using a turn like national because it is very meaningful within their culture\nMy German would you care to expand on that also in New York\nUh we've been showing this video of the Proud Boys\nOn a the Proud Boys are a number of them were arrested by New York police after they basically rioted and assaulted people outside the metropolitan Republican club where their leader\nWas inside speaking five of the nine members of this far right groups Proud Boys arrested on rioting and assault charges um\nThey arrest followed the October twelfth street attack and like she doesn't have members of the group were caught on camera\nPhysically assaulted anti fascist protesters after attending a talk by their leader Gavin again is I mean it's quite amazing Gavin again is speaking at the metropolitan ... public and club can you comment on that\nIt is troubling and you know one of the things to understand is how is the word ... governments gain power and one of the things that they have done in history is sanction street dogs to go out and commit political violence and when people get upset at that\nUh what you see is then legislation designed to prevent protests and of course we've already seen that number of state legislatures and regulations being promulgated\nA in Washington DC that would uh shut down some of the protests in front of the White House and elsewhere a national parks so you know this is a very troubling trend and the fact that you have the president United States identifying with these groups much like we saw right after Charlottesville\nWhere a comment about very fine people on both sides\nOf of this conflict\nUh it again gives these groups sanctions and I'd give credit to the FBI for finally arresting these people but it was a year after ...\nPublished an article that basically laid out who these people were and I tend to be for a free speech purist and this isn't about free speech and these are people who had long criminal records who who forecast that they were going to these protests to commit violence\nCommitted violence often filmed the violence and use that to recruit people for the next protests were there again they for cats they were going to go commit violence and the fact that they were traveling in her state should have been something that it was tracked by the FBI in real time\nNot here a year plus later after frontline\nOr basically put the whole thing on on national television\nAmazing things progress rights and the Guinness is lecture metropolitan Republican club\nWas about a tie a Yamaguchi who himself was a member of an extremist right wing growth in Japan and Nineteen sixty I'm a Gucci stab Japan's socialist party leader and hero afternoon to death\nAnd he's been celebrated as a hero extreme nationalist groups after leaving the event the Guinness was seen waving a ton of blade like the one used to kill a new law like turn\nRight exactly and again when you have people that are Doherty promoting this kind of a\nPolitical or\nA ... a ... I think that is more than just a wink to these groups that is an actual sanctioning that allows them to think okay the the government is on my side and when you don't see a a rap in real time police response\nThat then confirms that forum and the trouble is this has been going on for for roughly two years now so these groups are are are\nHave spent plenty of time recruiting and now that there are enforcing measures being taken it's easier for them to go back underground and be very strong in their in their ability to organize much more serious violence\nWell I Want to thank you both for being with us of course we're going to continue to cover that so we're heading back to New York today my German is a fellow at the Brennan Center for justice in New York University law not named for John Brennan the former CIA director who\nAh who had a a a pipe bomb address\nTo hand CNN causing ... name for justice Brennan from eighty eight to ... thousand for\nUm like German served as an FBI agent specializing in domestic counter terrorists and he's author of thinking like a terrorist inside of a former FBI undercover agent ten ... see me with us here in orange county and Santa Ana\n... I'm so let's turn to San Diego um can you talk about Republican Duncan Hunter a running against him are kept button a jar the Mexican Palestinian America\nOf a very significant race um I mean Duncan Hunter um is the person who I think he was the second Congress member to endorse President Trump\nOn he and his wife were indicted in August misusing two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in campaign funds on trips to Hawaii Italy in Lake Tahoe or other extravagant personal expenses including spending six hundred dollars to fly as family pet rabbit across the country hunters responded by blaming his wife\nOn Duncan Hunter was the second Congress member to endorse Trump the first New York Congressman Chris Collins has also been indicted on I Want to go to a campaign ad produced by Duncan Hunter attacking his Democratic opponent mark happen after\nSome are coming a jar is working to infiltrate Congress three different names to all the time we started the jury room masterminded the musical my father served\nMars you lose your support\nRisk we can't ignore Duncan Hunter and I approve this measure\nAnd this is mark camping in a jar responding to this ad on MSNBC\nHonestly what are we doing as a nation we have policies we have things we could talk about this is a deeply on America that and I feel like John McCain if you were with us today would be So Paul do remember he stood up against a woman who tried to disparage President Obama on the same line of argument\nAnd I think the party and became a party of Reagan even as long gone and it's heartbreaking because I have friends who are Republican it's un American it's not true I'm not a security threat I was given a clear as the FBI the security's ... Duncan Hunter\nWho was a criminal indicted for spending a quarter million dollars and the corruption smoking gun when you talked about when he paid about\nSixty thousand dollars he is guilty and it's only a matter of time into people hold them accountable\nThat's mark ...\nI'm ... I Love it it's a very American ... are you kidding me demonizing as being scared about Palestinians and Mexican this is like the Republican nightmare\nCome to live I Love it unfortunately ... district San Diego it's basically like Orange County the Nineteen seventies\nFilled with a bunch of Robin right wing lunatics kind of so I think Duncan Hunter gotta one who cares if he's indicted ... Republicans don't care if their candidates are indicted the Republicans ... Democrats just for being Democrats\nThey're evil and if you're Mexican on top of that you're even more evil and Palestinian like they can they can pin he's moslem anymore because he's Christian he converted Christianity so it's a nightmare a candidate I think he's a future of the Democrats and I think that'd be a wonderful thing if he's a future\nAnd find a comment and you'd like to make for people who are watching this around the country the possibility that the house could turn based on the racist here\nThe fact that we're having this conversation itself is historic no one ever thought that weren't county would even be close to a purple I Would say uh the OC Weekly the paper that I used to it and we were the profits we've been calling this for a long time this is Dylan and perfect revolution so my hope with the Democrats learn\nWhat's good and instead of a supporting corporate it's Democrats slip through the good Democrats\n... well I Want to thank the story I Know for being with us columnist for the LA Times he's the former editor of OC Weekly he resigned from the publication last year and protest against budget cuts\nThe says democracy now uh when we come back we'll look at a proposition a on a day November ballot around the rent control stay with us\nPleasure coming from you'd be better than that oh oh\nOur line drive in\nJust beyond around in a\n...\nWage\nAs far as you move into the\nOn the road\nShould follow um the revert to the\nDrawing leaving\nFollow the road by Tom Paxton and hills that democracy now as we in today's show looking how next month's election could impact California's housing crisis\nWill state residents gain access to a wider pool of rent controlled housing that's one of the issues that will be put to the vote November six with proposition ten which would repeal the Costa ... rental housing activists\nSweeping state law that permanently and sent some properties from rent control\nThe ballot measure has come under attack by landlords and private equity firms including the Blackstone group we're joined now by housing rights attorney Elena pop executive director of the ...

or intelligence right he did they canceled a meeting to share intelligence or the Senate of course because he said it's not a pretty picture you know Saudi Arabia\nHas to have and it's interesting

ah for four years of this uh dated him in the first moments just to get 'em compliant but aware\nAnd uh then at that point they wanted him to suffer it and they ended it most likely ended it with a ritual is the ceremonial beheading which is what they do but none of this is not sanctioned by the crown prince it cannot happen all of\nThose aircraft that flew there were from the oil flight yeah

Scott work in our front waited Trump is complicit in an assassination think about that he's helping the Saudis cover up the assassination of a U.S resident resident ... show the he's known 'cause you'll be was dead since the story broke lied to the world about a Trump is the biggest threat to our national security um because someone else wrote that Malcolm is like\nWhat is this open the door to now what next because they've ... obviously the world knows you can a buy off Donald Trump that he has you know no moral core of any kind\nOh I've been saying that for for a long time that the Saudis when he went to his trip to Saudi Arabia uh up until this point us presidents were immune\nImmune to their charms over there\nAnd they're ... the way that they do businesses they offer you cut they offer you a deal or they offer you a straight up Dr I had that happened to me or Iraq yeah it was standard practice you got ten percent kicked back to you on any deal and when I didn't do that in Iraq people were dumbfounded they couldn't understand me\nYou know because I'm an American Donald Trump is a player he came into that casino\nReady to take whatever kickbacks they offered ready to take whatever sweetheart deals facilitate Asian of of Jared Kushner's a debt all of that and I think this is a new facet of of of corruption that that that I was just a moment Albert Mohler is gonna really is going to go to town\nYeah I was gonna say that but I always say this every morning right\nThis is almost the most\n... what's the word but we'll during array this morning of\nThe indicted both fences criminal behavior corruption between the pro public story about how the trumps family's\nBusiness model has been fraught and this is a memorial for this is the most corrupted ministry that he was American history period ends down stuff on the FBI from moving their headquarters so because of this stupid hotel which he shouldn't be the first place there's another advantage I mean the fact he just shut the Saudis have bought him off basically I mean I just\nBut you know what's dangerous about this moment as all of that stuff comes out as you talk about Stephanie it it's done against the backdrop of what Seventeen Days Eighteen days away yeah\nIf they hold on to the Congress they are going to say all of this was out there the American people don't care right they made the referendum vote on what they want and it's we're now it's time to go to town\nWhile pollutants taking a victory lap while we were gonna victory yeah that's right and you set it up for ... to remember the sick feeling the morning after twenty sixteen election when you second guess yourself and ask what else you could have done to ... prevent Trump's victory you better be asking yourself now you're going to do in these three weeks before November six to save democracy\nUm so let's talk about that I had time for is on yesterday specifically to go I don't want to be here November seventh going they stole another one old diarrhea you know and like what can we do now to fight back and there's a couple of things we talked about um [noise]\n... ah tweeted North Dakota tribes needs a hundred thousand

voter ... the voter suppression this cycle feels almost frantic\nAnd then I think that's a really good way I mean I think they feel\nThis blue wave coming and this is so\nBlatant right front on it so blatant that sell out there they're they're they're trying to disenfranchise voters are in Georgia in North Dakota in Texas right\nThe numbers in Georgia are staggering over a million people in the last two years have been thrown off the voter rolls surprise surprise eighty percent of those black voter right in Georgia right and as as you said they know they can't win on the issues so they got to rig the system which is why they'd been projecting this idea of a rigged system for three years now\nYeah um okay so that a fight back I mean is everybody says five I think ... about that to fight for your vote\nYou fight ... fight as hard as you can do not take no for an answer let's help everybody that we can get registered get IDs get to the polls as Malcolm keep saying voter leader that'll also how hot down on the lines that a lot of people with kids with jobs they can't stand in line\nFor five hours not only just go out and vote now if you have the right to vote now voted absentee if you vote now on election day go and facilitate people at the bulls yeah there are people who need lines Sanders there are people out there who need to you know just need assistance and ride syllables\nYour vote this year is not enough you have to have bring\nAnother vote with news never voted before there's ... of never\nVoted I'm like no no no I I Need I Need evidence\nThat are not just

conversation here were these Stephanie because I don't know if he knows this or not but the intellectual author an inspiration for this idea that so many around the country been responding to is Malcolm Nancy I wrote about this in his book and he said what will make\nAnd lastly it's back to the car which if you bust [noise]\n\nCould be the most expensive night of your life getting pulled over

felons as what\nYour awful it's secret just about anything that you're supposed to tell me which is what do you do not transmit the punch to the enemy\nOn national radio [noise] I got to pick something clever to do only three million people listening will be I was just what does that count as you say what I'll get one of those\nYou committed treason side like the guy from ... from Virginia yeah draw which has those giant trader side yeah oh that trolls outside the courthouse yeah the bad guys that American you know\nI was hearing someone the other day talking about whoever wrote the New York times you know anonymous thing they're like well you know that really kind of his trees and and I'm like well so if you commit treason against a traitor what kind of is that [laughter] is there some kind of double ... [laughter] the three hundred my treatment he's already attracted you committed I guess that's\nAll right I'm All right so off or not and you were saying\nAbout uh what do you call it that we were talking about smaller well first of all your take on Rosen steam it the comments he made because we're all nervous right you know he obviously was defending the investigation but you're like is he fired right after the you know the mid term ... what was your take on all that\nWell look I mean I think the fact that Rosenstein still has a job is a is a tremendous thing for this country I'm shocked that he's still there yeah I thought they were going to use the um the leak if you will of the time stories the pretext to get rid of him\nBut fundamentally I think Trump knows what's going on you saw Don McGahn out also the general gas yesterday yesterday was his last day on the gig yeah after we learned hundreds of ours was the term\nOf cooperation Manafort was reported a couple of days ago yeah he's had dozens of hours with the special counsel's office something is clearly rumbling something is clearly cooking and as I said earlier I think those indictments or an ice and the question is how quickly Stephanie after the election\nDo does the report come out and and just start to leak into the into the mainstream yeah because if I\nGot nervous and the two months even if there's a huge blue wave like that a couple of month period before we actually take power right\nOh yeah we missed you can happen in that period of time but I suspect Fernandez right I think there there\nWas one piece of this puzzle which we we all spoken and written about several times in this room but what I call the bridge has not yet been lately uh done a five and that's the bridge between wiki leaks and the Trump campaign which is essentially the Russians and the Trump campaign\nThat is that why that's what men if they're talking to Manafort about his connection to stone in about\n... and I just I just know more and you know ... you know it's a joke\nOver in Mueller's team\nThat every morning they pick up the phone and they go get me Roger Stone they have all the break out of the laughter is like yeah they're going to get that guy is going to be fun [laughter] go get some active measures okay that's how we do it behind closed doors were always be joke [laughter]\nUm okay uh once again for non two weeks or three weeks from this very moment we will have either voted to flip the house and save democracies of confronting dark future for our beloved country that's three days before America's most important election we will march to save democracy what is the website again\n... saving democracy march dot com again that's saving democracy march dot com and I and it's just an honor to be sitting next to the intellectual inspiration for documents because as Malcolm has learned in the work he's done overseas\nWhat these governments that are trying to flip a system we're more than anything is a popular peaceful uprising national mobilization\nAnd that's why we're talking in only asking you were not asking you to put the uniform on and go put your life on the line where blue wearing American flag and just be out there show that there are safety in numbers and there are millions tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of us Stephanie that don't want this to happen and if you if\nYou don't have a history yeah and if you don't have enough to motivate you the fact that ... is right now openly taunting us that America has done America American influence is over\n... showing him exactly what Malcolm says in his book this is what is most afraid of ... and he actually warning Trump about right now is that ... an uprising like this all the power of democracy\nNow it's time for my buddy Ron Perlman the actor oh boy yeah boy to come out and announce that he's going to run for president now's the time he's been dabbling with that but imagine him on the trail imagine would he would like to write\nOn our happy hour he did it a fictional about even ... really like speech to Donald Trump is fantastic [noise] so New York [noise]\n[laughter] oh Larry

done this in Europe\nYeah oh okay so what you said we did early on bigger story U.S intelligence has special slash communications reporting network designed to inform the president of critical intelligence within five minutes of recognition\nA Trump has been lying to us about cars show these since day one and he still is usually the hammer yesterday oh well I don't look yeah maybe\nUsually five minutes a maximum of ten minutes from the moment of recognition yeah show on the day that ... a disappeared in that embassy that would not have been that level of reporting but the moment\nThat the Turks came out and said that he was killed or we would have used our own intelligence and that slash traffic would have gone straight to the president without stop yeah it it must be put before the president in ... that was the first day it's been two weeks now yeah he really much has been like\nAny way I've been pointing out ... you know about the Saudi arms deal on top of it is not a hundred and ten billion dollar deal right now it stands at fourteen point five billion\nA while he is personally ... millions of dollars in Saudi business where am I reading from um he's exaggerated by seven hundred percent the value of us weapons sale to Saudi Arabia um he said a hundred\nAnd ten billion with the military the biggest daughter in history of the world like\nEverything's what he has to lie about everything and everything in reality only fourteen point five billion a weapon sales have been approved by the Trump Administration\nOr in a ... this is a case where conflicts of

exile get killed on American soil\nYes and that happened a lot under Moammar Gadhafi he would send out hit teams to murdered his dissidents overseas and I think the Saudis just thought hey we can do

Boot ... former lifelong Republican and of course I'm Talking about this\nIt's going to be a long wait if they're looking for a serious investigation I mean asking the Saudis to investigate to mark

the economy on the surface good but it's not sound is not lasting is based on debt and the payment will come due soon\nHe said are rising interest rates in the housing bubble are are going to be negative factors he said uh this will eventually lead to a big busting is not a matter of if but when what economists are saying and Republicans do this every time they do big tax cuts for the rich yeah\n... right now we were in a trade war\nRight ... and the strength of this economy is Obama's and he's doing everything he can to destroy it yeah yeah I I just I Can't live and he's doing a great job of destroying it yeah I mean look at the ... it's just and it's incredible and yet they're spending the numbers to make it look like everything's just so great right\nRight but it's not yeah I

limped\nPresident Trump has ordered that flags that federal buildings be flown at half staff in the wake of the attack on the tree of life synagogue he called the anti Semitic attack an attack on all Americans\nUm that it was you know but done by I don't know some nefarious group or person to try and affect the midterms which is telling isn't it because you know the idea that it would affect the midterms tells you that they were concerned about that right that\nThat these people being targeted for political violence and of course it comes on the heels of two things one is this ongoing [noise] you know a\nThird a medium that they have a about left wing mob that are just you know running rampant through the streets or in the country\nAnd then also that the Democrats had paid for this caravan and Mexico and were somehow behind that Trump says that over and over again in his rallies so you know this idea that somehow or another the Democrats are doing all this stuff to try and win an election\nUh I think we can pretty well see where that's going because if the Democrats do when they will be because they ended up all this stuff to win an election I mean this sort of reaction coming from them and I can guarantee that no matter what happens with the with the investigation into the bombings um\nIt it it you know the the right is going to say that it was a deep state conspiracy if it turns out to be a right wing\nAssailant because that's how you know they they now have a a method of sort of covering themselves no matter what happens right or left wing or or it's a deep state FBI conspiracy to uh you know to a\nA unfairly tag on the right wing so you know they have this thing all coming and going but I was astonished at how quickly and how\nYou know viciously they kind of came out I mean I even in the worst sort of\nYou know ... um terrorist bombings or terrorist attacks that you find with you know where they're all immediately rushing to the assumption that it was Muslims even seemed worse than that I mean this seemed like it was just I mean it was I guess maybe it was defensiveness that made them do it but uh it was bizarre and of course the president\nWho didn't bother you know he usually he tweets about you know practically everything he had nothing to say oh he had to say on Twitter was you know I wholeheartedly agree to what's something that Mike Pence said you know some thoughts and prayers message and then he had at an event in the White House\nWere they sent out you know ... it was about the opioid crisis millennia came out said a couple of words and then talked about the opioid crisis than Trump came out and basically practically fell asleep while he was trying to say that you know we need unity\nAnd uh this is a bipartisan thing and then just dropped it and went on to is a prepared speech I mean he really didn't care and I mean I can only imagine what was going through his head when he saw that I mean he's probably glad actually to see the bomb threats I I'm assuming if you know actually for it\nI mean I think I think he probably\nThough um has some awareness that this cuts against and I think this is why there was such a strong defense in is I think you you hit the\nNail on the head there was this is um\nInterfering with the narrative that they were trying to build right I mean let's look at this week they had been trying to build this narrative\nThat are like you said the there is this caravan we're gonna talk about that later in the program this a caravan of people that could not be less threatening to the United states I mean I'm then\nYou know a a small rainstorm or the [laughter] you know off the coast of ah of I don't know it would be way out in the Pacific in terms of in terms of a a\nThreat to the country but just I mean to your point about their attempts\nTo to\nAh you know elongate because it's been going on now for a couple of weeks this notion of the Democratic mob right and the the protesters and\nEveryone is anti ... or antifa and um because in in and they were quite successful is still making like this notion that there is this for off the a left wing mob so much so that it knocked it even the Proud Boys off of the the radar and we talked about the Proud Boys on this program last week but\nWhen we come back I Want to just a recount\nWhat we saw on Fox News which to me captured\nThat moment a perfectly it was really really stunning\nBut it I think it explains why the right responded with all these conspiracy theories that somehow this was a false flag or they clearly know it makes their rhetoric and they're posturing and um it it brings it to life\nIn a way that you know they crystallize is what has been going on in this country for some time um but I think their reaction was even double the worst because of where they were trying to go with their narrative we got to take a quick break we'll be right back Sam street a ring of fire radio talking to the great Heather pardon or did they\n\n\nAnd now I look back at this week in history this week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicines Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel with the help of two assistance Taylor strapped herself into a letter harnessed inside an old wouldn't heckled barrel five feet high and three

Kennedy announcers us spy planes have discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba Kennedy announced that he was ordering a naval quarantine of Cuba to prevent Soviet shift from transporting anymore offensive weapons to the island what was known as the Cuban\nMissile crisis essentially ended on October twenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all weapons in Cuba\nAnd this week in twenty twelve Lance Armstrong is formally stripped of seven Tour de France titles he won from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand and five and banned for life from competitive cycling it was a dramatic fall from grace from\nThe one time global cycling icon so inspiring millions of people after surviving cancer that's your look back at this week in history [noise]\nBucket back during a fire radio I'm Sam cedar here with Heather dignity Parton from salon so Heather when we broke we were talking about\nThe of course you know the the attempted and this is what this world I mean someone someone referred to this I think it was Jeff Flake actually as a threat because we're not threats these were attempted\nBombings tempted maiming or murder I mean by sending these a pipe bombs essentially or some other type of a you know explosive device or through the mail in some instances some instance I think they may have been dropped off it's unclear um\nBut I Will I alluded to a moment on Fox News that\nReally summed up why the right was so angry about this happening they weren't angry because they were upset that their country\nHas a descended you know a into this type of violence they weren't upset because the uh these weapons were all targeting\nI'm the sort of hit list of left wing villains that Donald Trump and right wing media talks about [noise] uh they were upset because it ran counter to the narrative they were trying to push on Fox\nLiterally well it went like this on Wednesday morning they are talking about the lack of civility and they are talking about how both sides do it at\nOne hand you have these Proud Boys these round ... beating up people on the street on the other hand you have protesters who are and it literally wrote the said this on the current upsetting and preventing a Mitch McConnell from enjoying dinner\nAnd as they are trying to make it about both sides\nThey get the report and remember this the day after I'm a George Soros found a or not him but a a a bomb was found on his property\nYeah so I mean the peace in the paper that I wrote about his historical measure this was about a program that started way back in Nineteen Seventy six and continue to Nineteen Ninety nine\nBut recent reporting has shown that there's an attempt to influence law clerks at the Heritage Foundation puts together training academy\nThere are other uh less reported on a retreat some ... and things of that nature that you know we're just clear intent of indoctrinated federal druthers there's a whole apparatus you know the federal federal society which seeks to outlaw students\nYou know it's a very very early stages of their career and and puts them in the high profile jobs and works to get them onto the federal bench\n... there's a whole apparatus on the right and and what I wrote about in this piece is really one of the more embryonic versions of that something has happened in the seventies and eighties that really had this amazingly\nPowerful and robust effect\nOn changing attitudes within the federal judiciary\n[noise] All right well let's let's let's go through this it starts in Nineteen Seventy six what is the impetus I mean where what is it about this era I guess that\nCreated some awareness on the right any ways that the that we should be playing some type of long game here\nSo I mean this was the year of of what is known as the Powell memo where uh Lewis Powell who was we've actually became a Supreme Court justice\nThe time was a lawyer a road that businesses need to sort of get into the game of politics and more a focused way that they were losing out to the likes of of Ralph Nader in terms of influencing politics\nOr and this can be seen as part of that there was a movement\nA called the law and economics movement which at tempted to apply economic principles\nTo the law to to the uh the various ways in which a judge's go about understanding or various uh parts of the law including criminal law a family law a regulation all sorts of things\nAnd the lawn economic center which was very much a funded by corporations a hundred and five months into a contemporary accounts\nI put on this two to three weeks seminar\nFor federal judges they did it down in plantation island Florida\nWas a resort area they drink a lot of wind they it was it was seen as as something that was you know a a a pleasurable trip in some senses but also a very intensive almost like a semester\nLong seminar in economics plugged into it to the ... period\nAnd it was for federal judges\nSo judges who are you know wanted to understand more about economics and how they may be a lie that within their cases there were ... case work their career\nCould could get it there and and and at the time or the theory that the law and economics movements sort of put forward is that\nUh there is no structure underlying the decision making that ah that\nIs made in the judiciary\nThat there there are no sort of formal ways to kiss tickle analysis to look at whether there is discrimination whether there is a proof of flawed whatever it is\nAnd uh they set about to to change that and the the the seminar was billed as very much a non partisan sort of objective look at at here's some tools you can use you judges or to to to make sense of the law\nHowever was put together by a guy named Henry nanny who is a conservative\nOr there were liberal economist that that gave lectures as part of the series but they were confined to certain segments of of of the discussion and conservatives were were very much in the forefront when a certain large subjects came up\nManny controlled the curriculum he he knew exactly what he was doing and eat that while he sort of presented it and objective manner\nBe clear intent of this was to indoctrinate federal judges in in conservative views business friendly views of the law and by Nineteen Ninety over forty percent of all federal judges took this seminar\nSo this is very very widespread a uh a lot of the people who were deciding these cases with taking these classes are and ah what this paper then then wanted to look at is what effective is how\nAre you in before we get into that like I I also want to just a touch on this this notion that these seminars\nJust simply by defining the arena by co mingling the notion of economics in economics itself as as a as a discipline and a profession has its own ideology that is baked into it right of course\nUh but the idea of applying cost benefit analysis and economic efficiency um\nEat almost I mean I guess I'm back when I was in school the one of the things that um you you have you did anything in the social science is the first thing as you advanced um ah through the years was the professors would tell you you need to find the underlying assumptions\nOf any endeavor and once you do everything after that follows\nFairly predictably and if and if you sit there and trained people that the law is an assessment of cost benefit analysis in economic efficiency\nUm and those are the prominent I'm a I guess a elements that you must follow then then what follows after that becomes fairly hum a standardized right I mean I think that's\nRight and and you know when you are talking about a case uh where you you know maybe it was some business that has some litigation before a court uh they they might not be able to win on the fact that they poisoned a certain number of people\nAre in in a in a very as this specific area but they might be able to find some economists they can tell you well the the the there were costs here but the benefits of providing the service or whatever it is they provided all these people so surely outweigh the costs\nSo a economics is a field upon which business can more easily a fight that battle\nUh it's it's more favorable terrain for them and so yes if you're if you're you know boiling down the law which has certain\nSort of a a you know it's it's it's it's a little more abstract than just cause benefit into this framework then yeah you're going to get a certain\nKind of understanding of the law are coming out of\nAll right David we're going to take a break when we come back I Want to ask you um how how it was determined by this working paper that judges decisions were impacted or what how did this manifest itself\nHow did eat\nThese these changes in the way that federal judges\nAssess the law and assess their cases how did that trickle down to future generations\nOf of would be a both lawyers and or not would be but lawyers and would be judges that would come after them and Leslie I'm curious as to your perspective on how this might have implicated anti trust when we talk about things like a fish and sea and cost benefit analysis\nThis is going to have an impact on the way that a anti trust\nA is a is assessed and um and executed and we know there was a big change right around the same time we got to take a break I Am

laundering but why\nYou know I don't know it's ... it's very tough because you know this is just rank racism left his face what's happening here that's a bunch of brown people\nAnd even if you look at the at the at the pictures you're ... you're not seeing a group of hardened criminals or or an army you're seeing a bunch of women and children older people you know single men kind of you know walking with a with a pack over their back I mean it's it's\nNot a kid on their shoulders a kid\nOn their shoulders right and and you know carrying a wheelbarrow where something I mean these are people\nWho work quite clearly and threatening in any way as a group or as individuals I mean this is a bunch of Central American\nYou know folks who are you know you don't take on a thousand miles walk unless you're pretty desperate I mean these people are not doing this for no reason but it's that sight of that and that this is what got Trump so excited over this was when they saw the caravan take place\nThey realize that they were going to have pictures of brown people in a group\nAnd and Trump even went out of his way to say look ... did you see the pictures down at the border and kind of assuming that if people were too stupid to know that it was actually the Mexico Guatemalan border right and not the American you know the U.S Mexico border\nAnd and there was all this you know there are people in a crowd and there was military there the Mexican military was there and he was so excited 'cause I really think he thought the Mexican military was going to shoot in the crowd\nBecause that would be the only way to stop this right I mean is that these people were coming over in various ways and across the border and the Mexicans weren't going to do that but and he ended up being very disappointed but this is the idea of this you know there's a mass of brown people coming and this woman that you mentioned in the New York times article I mean she was at Michigan\nI mean as it did it to start a martyr fear from you know French Canadians coming than than any of these people from Central America I mean they're walking but they're not going to walk and how far\nUm so you know this this is ... ... this was just playing right into their hands and and you know I just\nI don't think I Need to um you know go too far into this but I'm sure you'll you'll agree with me that the media played into that I mean the New York times had front pages three days in a row with pictures of this big caravan or you know Trump had to love that\nIt's not and it's not a front page story it really is not first of all as you point out their thousand miles away\nSecond of all even if they do reach the border and many of them will fall off by the way these caravans have happened before and people some ended up staying in Mexico others ended up\nGoing back I mean there's ... there's never this group that states sticks together the whole time but when this group comes to the border here's what they do they turn themselves in because they're applying for refugee status right turn themselves and there's no battle\nThere's no fight there is no nothing and then you know they are cleared or not for for ah\nFor for some kind of a silent and you know they they take an asylum claim I mean there's nothing violent or invasive without any of it there and they aren't doing anything illegal by the way I mean if you come and turn yourself in at the U.S\nBorder and say I want to apply for refugee status that's the law now Trump knows that and he was saying we have changed a lot\nWe have to say that as US law and international law right and wrong so these people are not in the uk locally all of that is used illegal they're not even undocumented immigrants they are refugees seekers and then they get\nDisposed or disposed of their cases get disposed of in one fashion or another some are are very few frankly\nA will mean if if um if past performance is indicative will receive a status um you know extended status others will be basically told you got to leave\nNow and so that this was all completely manufactured and when we when we come back to I Want to like get a sense of like how\nHow the media should address is I mean clearly the New York times has no reason\nTo put pictures of the caravan on for three days in a row\nBut let's talk affirmatively like how should they deal with these type of life we have the same thing will talk about this to return this idea of a second round of tax cuts does not even remotely close to that any more so than you know I'm going to announce that the next incidentally next lottery\nI'm winning a billion dollars [laughter] like the ... those two statements have almost the identical um uh validity or we could break I'll be right back Sam see the ring of fire radio we're talking with a great degree\nWe call\nA rock and roll lovers Danny west supposed to take a journey back to this week in rock

some of that or ... or ... who ... who are [noise] hope I ... off of all seven of\nOh\n\nWe're back on ring of fire radio I'm Sam cedar here with Heather pardon or as you may know her\nTo be so Heather in the last thing that we were talking about this caravan which represents no threat to anyone and it is it is a story\nThat I mean it it's very reminiscent of the Ebola store you remember that one yes and then also happened at an off year election and this gets the Republicans are juices flowing ... it's almost like they don't even care that it's completely fake I mean it you know\nYou wouldn't be hard to sort of figure out the implications of you know three or four thousand um ... families\nWalking from uh the southern Mexico and we don't even like you said we don't even know where they're going to end up certainly some will end up at the U.S border and they will apply for asylum others will will peel off along the way but\nThis is where we're still like twenty thirty forty days away from any of these people making it this far north or do you mean to the border\nI frankly from my perspective so what\nAt least to some degree with the Republican base right we've got to take a break we got a lot more to talk about I'm Sam see the ring of fire radio dignity will join me in the next hour and we'll be right back in just a moment [noise]\nJust ahead how banking giant UPS made billions off of selling bad bonds to their clients in Puerto Rico I'm Sam cedar we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n\n... here to discuss the case in how you BS was selling bad bonds attorney Michael ... from Lebanon pap Antonio so Mike before we um\nWe talk about how this was litigated give us a sense\nOf ... just the context\nIn which I'm this claim moved\nForward [noise] yes uh salmon the thanks for having me on but uh this all related to the Puerto Rico a bond market which in twenty Thirteen suffered or began to suffer a collapse and a related specifically to a couple of types of products that were\nSold by a firms down in Puerto Rico and even some firms on the mainland but specifically in this case\nA it was UPS or who had under wrote bonds under wrote literally billions and billions and billions of dollars\nOf these bonds and encouraged\nPublic entities public corporations down in Puerto Rico to continue issuing these bonds at a danger afraid and more specifically beyond the bonds a lot of proprietary products in these came in the form of closed and funds which really served as a rapper\nUnder which UPS could wrap up the bonds that are under wrote into a product that then sold to regular retirees regular mom and pop investors and it sold them by the boatloads by the truckloads of backed him up and sold them to\nAnyone and everyone their retirees people with very small network people with large networks it was a a profit center for them and they sold these bonds and these funds are for years and made a lot of money doing so but then in twenty Thirteen and\nIn twenty Fifteen sixteen as Puerto Rico situation deteriorated uh these funds and the bond suffered significant losses and folks who had ah the retirement assets invested in these types of risky products or suffered huge I mean just terrible losses\nOkay I I Need you to go or we're going to back up just a little bit here so I mean clearly what we're talking about some measure of a you know a fraudulent representation of the quality of these bonds\nIt appears in and you'll tell me if I'm right but but but just walk us through what it was so they're underwriting bonds on behalf of municipalities in what is what is involved with the underwriting just I'm essentially helping them I'm a take them to market\nThat that's exactly right Sam I mean we you ... you can there's other things that are involved with it but at the end of the day under riding a bond is really you're just giving them an avenue to actually take the bonds the market and more importantly and perhaps this is most important in this case\nActually sell the bonds because you can underwrite a bond but if you can't sell it to somebody if you don't have\nA customer to sell it to then it doesn't do any good and that's what one of the big things that UPS brought to the table in this business was\nThey had especially in Puerto Rico they had fifty percent of the retail customer base on the entire island so they had access to the clients and an underwriting these bonds they did help bring them to market and then actually distribute these bonds and you and you\nMentioned they wrap them up and something ... walk us through what that means in lay person a terms\nSure that was just it gave him a little bucket to put these things into and and it says specifically was a is a closed in finding closed and funds operate a little bit differently ... people were probably generally familiar with say a mutual fund\nAnd and these are like a mutual fund but there are a little bit different these don't trade on the New York stock exchange um these aren't regulated in the same way these can use the leverage and leverage is just a form of thinking that is borrowing so when you\nBought one dollar of one of these funds\nWhat they were able to do by creating it as a closed and fun they borrowed against that and purchased another dollar so every dollar you put a new one of these products they were able to get rid of essentially two dollars worth the securities that they needed to get rid of or a dump if you will\nThis is sound like one of those situations where they have the clients and they create a product in a market or because they have\nThis sort of this captive audience without really being too concerned about what the quality of that product is but just a relying on their ability to sell them because they have a direct line to them\n[noise] yeah I I think that's actually a pretty fair assessment of what it is because especially when you looked at it and you start getting into some of the quality of these bonds and certainly there's there's arguments about some of the sand that can be had I mean we could have a discussion about some of the the ... features or their priority features on some of these bonds but some of these bonds were\nHonestly a joke I mean there were some there were literally moral obligation bonds that were being sold the folks and and those those are worse than they even sound it's it's like an audio you it has no guarantee no backing no security interests\nAnd the way these are able to get passed on to clients is by having people there who stand to gain significant money from underwriting fees from commissions from management fees really kind of collecting at every level in the sales process so what\nExactly I mean uh so they're selling their they're basically a underwriting these loans and they're taking them to market as a as the financial securities what were these under I mean you say I'm somewhere just moral obligations in other words there was\nNo legal way of compelling repayment and\nFor these securities I mean just walk us through what people normally expect when you buy a bond and it's theoretically right it's a safe investment because well theoretically many times depending on on the quality of the bonds but what if what if people normally expect when they go and buy a bond like how does that work\nYou you you took the word out of my mouth that's what people think people think I'm not investing in options\nI'm not investing in an ideal of a company or even a a stock you're buying a bond and the word that I think a lot of people the ... normal regular people think well the bond is is safe that's the thing is maybe not gonna give you a ten percent return obviously but\nIt's it's going to give you some security and that's why it was so easy for them to sell these products because\nYou're selling a bond you're selling a bond and they they sold it as a bond is\nEither backed by something where it's guaranteed by something and it was easy to sell it is as secure so someone who is in their seventies or eighties is thinking that they're they're buying this for their retirement in the ... the principles going to be safe and that's what I think the average person who's going in investing thinks that\nUh if if you're going and buying bonds that that it is something that is going to be safe and secure and that you'll make some income on it for your retirement but not taken a big risk not not reaching for the stars are not trying to hit a grand slam and knock it out of the park I mean you're you're talking bonds year which is what again made it so easy for them and so there's this expectation\nThat they are lending I guess I'm In is a policy uh money I mean are these all of municipal bonds or they were kind of bonds are the\nYet so primarily municipal bonds there's a sales tax financing bonds there's a pension obligation bonds\nOr there's a lot of different types of bond summer general obligation bonds of of the government of Puerto Rico so it it's there's quite a few issue were down there the the the central the central bank the government development bank in Puerto Rico also offer bond so there's there's a lot of different ones involved and of course there was just\nOr their financial advisor they went after financial bias of what to do got recommendations from these are people from all walks of life these are some are lawyers summer doctors some are people who ah worked blue collar jobs in and save money their entire lives we we represent people across\nThe gamut from every all different places on the island\nUm from different backgrounds people who were born in Puerto Rico people who were born in Cuba and came to Puerto Rico um in in the sixties or anything and everything you name it from from young people from people in their twenties and thirties people\nAre who are in their eighties and nineties so we we seen this literally affect everyone on the island because it\nReally did permeate um what the biggest brokerage firms on the island were doing in the business model that they operated\nAnd so when you as as an investor if you have a a four one K. if you have an investment account you would have signed onto a account opening green and in that account opening ... there is an arbitration agreement which says if you ever have a complaint\nIf you ever have something that you need to litigate with us about you can't go to court you can't go to state quarter federal court anything like that you have to go to arbitration and you have to go to fit in arbitration\nFinn or is the financial industry regulatory authority and and based on case law around the country that's where we file our our our claims that's where we filed the cases that we bring because of those arbitration agreements the clients are essentially forced to sign\n'em and we litigate the claims there and and there's a lot of things about the process that I could make complaints about there's a lot to be done to make that a more\nA fair process but really we feel like we stand\nAs the people who represent the client as as the way to protect these people against receiving a second injustice after they've already received bad advice if you've already lost some money\nOr what we do is we try to fight with them to give them a fair shake to have their story be told and have the truth be told and and in this particular case that we tried\n... that's what we did and the arbitrators they awarded us full damages they ordered every penny\nA day we asked for the full content compensatory damages they worded attorneys' fees and the water costs and it was just a little bit over Nineteen million dollars a that was awarded a in this case against UPS UPS was word to pay\nAmazing story a

there is\nA hobby is\nRacial report deadly Pittsburgh Senegal shooting I'm Christopher approves\nFederal prosecutors have no charge forty six year old Robert Bowers with twenty nine counts including hate crimes\nNuclear weapons in Europe to defend against this and the people of Europe didn't want any part of it so this is a very big deal and it worked\nI worked out pretty well now as I said there is cheating going on and the thing is the Russians have one of the U.S to be the ones to terminate the agreement right they've been provoking it so that the U.S will pull out\nAnd they've been trying this for years and it ... the Bush administration even Don Rumsfeld went in and get outta here we're not doing that and the Obama administration the same thing\nWe're not going to terminate the agreement so that you you know you get you off the hook here now you just you have to comply well all that's changed because John Bolton wants to terminate all agreements and Donald Trump is you know I mean let's face it he's an F ing moron particularly when it comes to nuclear\nAnd which he claims to be a big believer in arms control and he wants to bring peace to the world and eliminate all arms but his philosophy of how to do that is for us to build up so many nuclear weapons that everyone else will be scared\nAnd ... and they'll destroyed theirs because they'll be so frightened and I'm not ... that is not hyperbole either right that is actually what he says he says that outright I mean it's the most sophomoric view in the world but you know and you know what really happens right the U.S builds up everybody else builds up to what happens so\nI mean if the exact opposite of what we should be doing but that's his view of it you know he's this very you know schoolyard bully method of of running the world\nAnd so that you know they're they're planning to do this now my suspicion is and and you know maybe I'm way off base here but my suspicion is Trump and and and putting have been chit chatting\nOn the cutie about arms control from the beginning this seems to be a little tough topic that the two of them talk about but they don't talk about publicly\nRight and in fact the meeting in Helsinki supposedly you know that there was some some evidence that they talked about it then so I have a feeling that Trump is announced that he's withdrawing from the treaty he's terminating it and then he's going to meet with putting personally now in Paris next month right after the election\nI have a feeling that the two of them are going to come out with some kind of an announcement sort of on the lines of Kim Jong un announcement\nWhich will be meaningless and will totally benefit the or the Russians but Trump will stretch around like his you know the big you know peace maker and that that's how this whole thing is going to come out\nAnd and and the ideas that ah they need to clear the the the ... of any type of nuclear agreements right\nHair up all the old bad ones that were bad for America and that you know that's how Trump will sell it\nThat these were all bad news nobody knew what they were doing we're going to do a new one that's going to be a lot better and they'll find some agreement and then I mean I could be wrong but I just have a feeling that Trump said some stuff this week\nAbout putting that was totally out of character races they can't gain need you know we did this big trash talk you know world wide wrestling commentary\nThey can't gain me thinking if he thinks he can get away with is he's got something you know he's got another thing coming kind of talk it\nWas very strange when I heard it I went oh that's weird and it made me think that this is a game\nAt this actually is a game that this is some kind of a thing that they are they've cooked up sort of to create some sense I mean I could you know putting putting isn't a genius and he's not ready you know it's not some bond villain whose trying to take over the world but

B. Q. AM's Thirteen fifty\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell comeback ring of fire radio I'm Sam cedar if you aren't following the Florida midterms\nThan you're missing out on what could be an incredibly important election every day there seems to be a new story coming out about a candidate running for US Senate and governor and here to explain what's going on down in the sunshine state Rick outs and editor of the in weekly so Rick let's let's\nJust start with for our audience who are not uh from uh Florida and maybe aren't familiar with it you know Florida for a long time was always sort of the a turning point of at least our modern presidential elections I'm\nNot to mention that uh there was a little bit of a discrepancy back in two thousand I don't want to dwell on that any more\nThan a hat do at the moment um but uh in this last election in at least in twenty sixteen Donald Trump made a Florida was was was pretty much out of play wasn't\nIt it it was I'd be Florida's a truce swing state uh there were a lot of people believed that Clinton was going to win it in twenty sixteen\nBut the poll started to come in and if they came in at every county turn red except for a handful\nOf Obama was able to win both times here primarily by strong push in the central part of the state where the where the universities are and and that just didn't happen to the Clinton campaign didn't galvanize that same group of voter out there\nWell I mean I Do have a sense of what that was about in other words with this say um was it a unique\nUm was it unique in the sense that Donald Trump really spoke to Florida values or was it unique in the sense that Hillary Clinton was just not particularly inspiring to a certain populations in Florida for some reason\nOr or or is it was it is is it part of a sort of a trajectory I mean what what was behind that\nWell I I think that um\nA lot of it was just the overall warning you know change you you had the same type of government essentially for eight years and the feeling of change in the Washington was in gridlock I think that was a factor it made people open to to try and something different\nI think that that ... that the Clinton campaign even though they brought star power to the state and had a lot of people going around for ... that she just never galvanized motivated people to to to go to the polls as much as the Obama campaign did\nA and a lot of African American stayed home they didn't get out and vote\nPart ... part of it with some of the mix messaging that was happening over social media there was a there was a certain amount of you know this was in the bag we don't really need to vote who is going to win I think there were some of that happening some apathy there I think the other half of the was the ...\n... she just didn't connect with them at the same level or as a bottles that with the\nOkay so would that um I mean with with with that knowledge um in our mind let's let's turn to this mid term because\nI you know the if I was to put myself in my mind where I was a year ago let's say and I was thinking about the um\nThe Senate race a Bill Nelson and a Rick Scott I think we knew at that point Rick Scott was running I'm not sure if we knew who was going to be\nA running in the Democratic primary in fact I think we've probably didn't right I mean we ... well let's start with the Democratic primary or a democratic ah I mean excuse me the the race it for a governor\nElected are there for a moment because I'm\nNot ... that's the one that is a fun one day and let's start\nWith that because I think in some respects I get the sense that if um if if the Democrats are grab the governorship and the Senate at least in Florida it's\nGoing to because people pulled um people's I I guess choices were sort of almost in that order in other words that the governor you know we don't see this too too often it seems to me but a new governor pulling across the line and income than\nSenator is I think not a dynamic that is typical cry tell us about Andrew Gillum because I don't know that a year ago people would've guessed that he would have been the nominee no ...\nHe would um he was running against the the favored candidate was a ... ram Bob grams daughter a former congressman very personable uh and we were a lot of us are newspaper included sort of looked at at her as well this is the year the woman\nThat this would be ... and she was very good on issues but she was not that different from what the Democrats have run in the past down here Sam uh we've had very uh\n... candidates or to to say the least Jim Smith a Alex Sink who was a state CFO chief financial officer who lost to Rick Scott the first time the last time they had the governor's race it was Charlie Crist a former governor running hit switch parties\nAre and they were all calm level candidates that didn't excite voters Andrew Gillum is a is I think the new type of candidate that the Democrats really need\nA lot of bold ideas he doesn't back off of an idea they he won't let himself get labeled by the other side he responds to attacks immediately uh\nAnd I want to talk to you I mean I just want to put a pin and that for the moment the I've seen some of those debate clips and that was that was stunning it um and I want to talk about that but continue he's he's got a lot of bold ideas and um and he's I mean is he the first African American a candidate for governor in in Florida as history\nWell outside probably reconstruction I Believe he is definitely the first of a major political party are to be their nominee going into the general election\nAnd uh he is dynamic he is a he meets people well and he had a really good pitch a win win was wet and that we had a lot of other candidates to fill a vein of popular mayor from a Miami Beach was in their Jeff Greene a billionaire that put\nHis money into the campaign in ages sort of seemed to be on the edge of this but he would go around and say we can do what we've done in the past he would tell the Democratic uh people in all the communities we can do what we did in the past and we could lose again I Will win\nAnd it's a he got a real good influx of money about ten days before the primary and you could just see that the the campaign flip that just see the enthusiasm start to come out that Obama type enthusiasm a and it is carried over into this general election and and\nA disastrous was slightly head coming out of the primary in fact Republicans I talked to a lot of Republican power brokers a lot of consult us and they were they were excited that Andrew Gillum was was the opponent they thought that he's going to be so easy to beat it has been just the opposite and and their candidate Rhonda Santa's\nIs turning out to be more and more of a one trick or one note a singer and would not an empty suit\nWith the ... so uh this dynamic we have someone who is I mean a\nRun to citizenship and he's not an old person I mean he's the only both\nAbout the same age I think once forty forty one the other one's thirty nine they're young they're both\nOf them right and and but Gillum comes off as just simply\nUm he just seems to be um different in the sense that are just sent us is saying the same thing\nThat a Republican running for office could have been saying\n... you know four years ago six years ago ten years ago Fifteen Years ago uh I mean he's a little bit more a brash but we've had certainly Republicans run for governor let's say up in New York's a state who sounds like him you know he uh the Santas amino mentions Donald Trump but we've\nThe guy's a beer sound exactly the same ... same type of attitude you know a sending around faxes of ah of racist jokes about Obama stuff like this um and but Gillum sounds very different when it comes to his politics in Florida\nUh but ... the I ... the idea that uh that can garner a such popularity really I think speaks to I'm a dynamic that\nPeople are only now beginning to understand in terms of of how voters vote\nRight um you know and you know as I I don't know that as Florida\nGoes the rest of the country goes but I'm Florida is going to be a very different state for the Democratic candidate who's running and twenty or twenty twenty it seems to me in terms of the presidential elections and I would imagine\nThat a a guy like Gillum is going to get in and he's not going to be a cherry picking which people who are going to get their right to vote back right in that state right\nWell and we're getting Gillum is is important because this is another democratic candidate that doesn't fit the mold of democratic candidates that we've had over the last Twenty years\nObama broke that well but we didn't have a whole lot of other the same people stayed in the Senate and house seats and and we saw Democrats lose state houses in lose\nA legit state legislatures and and give them the way I I think he is a it's it's still a tight race we're we're talking about five points separate him and ... got a week to go\nA but a little less than a week really but just a few days but uh it is is generated excitement that I haven't seen since when Obama first ran into a which was very exciting for the state\nWell obviously we are now just a days away from the election right or is there early voting in Florida we have thirty seconds\nLay it is and I know it it's it's a much higher rate than it was in twenty sixteen that's that's the early returns coming back we're having a high number of early voting I think Republicans are voting a little bit more an early voting or the Democrats right now but that doesn't mean that they're voting for the scientists and Rick Scott\nInteresting well our folks are if you're in Florida go out and vote in fact if you're anywhere go vote or whether it's\nUm as you hear this or this coming Tuesday I ...

I have to take that money and go buy a few because I guarantee you whatever size we don't have ... that's the size child that walks in the door\nAs that just always seems to be the way it goes but of course you know we do have enough folks that are you know live in the area and burn earlier county that we're going to if if you run out of one size you're ... you're going to have a need because that's going to be coming through the door right now the statistically speaking [laughter] to say it to\nNot ... an added attraction at the at the hotel is we have a haunted house oh my gosh tree into it is if they bring news socks or new underwear that's the only way to get in well they could also pay a dollar oh okay but I prefer the other way that don't yeah we've been there for the socks and underwear\nThat you trust yeah that that does sound huge now is that going to be better for you then then a cash on that particular thing because a lot of folks you know it just sort of works out with what they're going to apply the money to do you do school supplies to you and I talk about her yeah\nYeah we do school supplies backpacks course we do hygiene items travel sized\nThings um you know your child or travel I hygiene items um we do stuffed animals we do toys\nI'm you know we kinda do it do it all for the kids and Asian prom yeah we have we take prom dresses leave and have a tough now that we loan out just the one just the one and we get a clean start bright cleaners is really good when you know somebody boroughs that we take it to start brightened they clean up for some and bring it you know\nBring now that that's very helpful you know and I said just the one because I was like that but I I don't really made it like that other than I Do may not like that we need some more [laughter] yeah it really is yeah it's really nice to be able to you know it's a I think it's a thirty four so if you happen to be a very for we got to cover you got to yeah for the tax and stuff but\nI Would you have dresses in there to do those are those get to stay with the girls that they get to stay with a girl that's\nNice you know there there's a that happens quite a lot is a is people will go out and buy the prom dresses\nAnd then they have no use for it like you know and so we we did kind of find out that ah it's a very good thing to kinda get those donated and then just pass them along to the gym you know the next person so so if you do have a prom dress out there that's like in a closet somewhere to definitely get a locker five oh five how would they get that to you that particular item\nThey can bring it just again we have different drop offs and you know just a minute throughout our website locker federal five dot org\nUm and they can go on there and see our our

can always dropping off the locker five oh five during our ours um and then we have a couple of other drop offs that you can look at on our on our website\nSo boy that's a pretty good diet and and I bet you that's the the you know the cleaners they're either end of the sale lead talking about like the way West End of it when it ends up there and rearrange I'm\nKinda well at Coors Light Coors okay
