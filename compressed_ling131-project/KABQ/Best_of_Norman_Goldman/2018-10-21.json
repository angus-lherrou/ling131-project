hundreds of documents to determine that quote ethnicity is not a factor and Elizabeth Warren's rise in law\nOr any Lenski welcome to democracy now you did an extensive investigation on can you talk about what led up to the\nSenator warrants release of the video and the DNA test on Monday but first talked about what you found out all the people that you interviewed a what the allegations are and what people said to you\nTo shore happy to um so you know at the Boston Globe um we had been asking for um\nFor years for six years really for Elizabeth Warren to really is her personnel records really from Harvard University of Pennsylvania where she had been a law professor and the reason that we are so eager to look at these files is there's been this long\nRunning allegation against her that she um checked the box and used her Native American\nHistory as a as a reason to um to get ahead and so that's always been the allegation and the reason for it is a back I think it was in Ninety or eighty seven when she was at the University of Texas is a professor\nShe started calling herself I'm a minority lifting herself as a minority in the ... a a larger tree\nAnd the very next year she gets this really big job at a at a law professor at an Ivy League institution\nAnd so the idea was oh my goodness the moment she identifies herself as a minority professionally that's when this big promotion comes and then a few few years later she goes on to an even bigger institution to Harvard\nSo we went back and we looked at as many documents as we could find and ... to ... to find out I mean what was there some correlation there because on the face of it it looks like there could be\nUm but when you look at you know starting with the University of Pennsylvania\nUm we were able to find a document that had never before been reported it was a ten page an equal opportunity memo that the University of Pennsylvania I had to fill out when they hired war and\nAnd they had to fill it out because they were ... they saw themselves as hiring a white woman and so they they had to you know in the course of ten pages go through this giant pool of applicants that they had looked at for this position break them down by Sachs by minority and you know the number of black\nApplicants a number of Asian applicants the number of Native American\nApplicants and then say look after looking at all of these people we ended up hiring a white woman Elizabeth Warren and um because we could not find an equal or better minority for the job and that that's quoted in the report\nAnd so to me that pretty much solved the issue from University of Pennsylvania clearly she was not a minority higher if\nThey the um uh if the the hiring committee they're always having to argue to hire her as a white woman\nFell on that then takes you to Harvard after a few years at Penn and she goes she teaches at Harvard in Ninety three as a visiting professor at which is a sort of weird thing that law schools do\nThey have you come and when they're looking at hiring you and you have like this year long job interview 'em so she taught for a year at Harvard and they loved her and they did an unusual thing which is offer her job you know while she was still there and it's still teaching and Ninety three\nAnd however an she initially turned that job down she wasn't really gunning for it um there are a number of reasons but she turned it down\nBut at how you really wanted to see is there a similar form you know is there a similar EEOC forum that she had to that in Harvard had to fill out\nAnd if there was one I just I couldn't find it so to look at Harvard and understand you know did they hire her because of her Native American heritage I instead had to look at this vast hiring committee and and the way it works at Harvard is\nHadn't even law professors get to vote on who can join their style kind of who can join the club and they have is sort of to they had this to meetings about Elizabeth Warren and sort of picking up her scholarship trying to figure out do we want this woman on our staff\nAnd so I tracked down every single living person who would have been in that meeting and tried to interview all of them to see if I could find anybody who said yeah we ... we saw her she was Native American and we wanted a Native American on the staff\nOn this for more than a year and her approach to this is quite different than say Hillary Clinton I mean her idea is like look I'm I I got a tip is test well it does actually show that this is the first proof\nThat she has been able to produce that through her family stories were true and that there was\nNative American ancestry and her family um so you know this is the first time in in six years there's been something beyond you know a a family lore to rely on and put this claim although for credit because they're saying my goodness it's so far far far far back does it really count 'em and do people\nHave to make that that decision for themselves um I just I Know that this is one of those questions Everytime I write about Elizabeth Warren\nI get I Would get so many emails about why does she just take a DNA test I mean ... you know they ... they would be um from across the board it didn't feel like the sort of normal um you know offered him generated type of emails they would just be from\nA regular people I got so many from one story I actually had to create like a forum emailed to respond to them all so my guess is that she was getting in a a similar amount of\nQuestions for my constituents and I guess this is the way that she decided to deal with it which is very different from\nHow a lot of candidates woods and we'll see how whether it was wise or not\nWell I mean it seems very quickly that she has a maybe for other reasons expressed regret about her decision on releasing be taking the DNA test and releasing it saying I Wish I had been more mindful of the distinction between heritage and tribal citizenship\nIs it your sense that she has been a regretful for this reason\nNo I mean I I don't think she regrets during the ... I have no indication that that that's the case at all I mean I think what she regrets is\nMy sense wouldn't be that she regrets calling herself Native American at Harvard at a pet I mean I think that's where her\nUm she has learned a lot more about ethnicity and about how ... tribal membership works and how a family story is not the same as\nUm you know having the experience of being a member of a tribe but I you know ... the idea that she robots doing a DNA test I I have not heard that from anyone\nAny length scale and I thank you for being with us Washington DC deputy bureau chief for the Boston Globe a link to your piece ethnicity is not a factor and Elizabeth Warren's rice and law after break we host roundtable discussion with a Jew by lawyer ...

American ancestry she's come under fire since releasing the DNA tests showing Native American lineage and her family tree in a video released Monday she told her family's story\nMy mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIt had been Indian Territory until just a few years earlier when did you become an\nDaddy always said he fell head over heels and my mother\nOr\nMy daddy's parents herrings bitterly to marry my mother read was part Native American\nJust short of discrimination was common to time\nSo when my mom always Nineteen and my daddy was when they love and together they built a family\nElizabeth Warren has said her mother told her family had ties to the Cherokee and Delaware tribes\nBut Native Americans across the country are criticizing wise decision to use a DNA test her heritage\nJohn Koskinen junior secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation said quote sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA test can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence of tribal affiliation\nUsing the DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong come\nAre we hosted roundtable discussion joining us from Fargo North Dakota is Tara house to national campaign director for honor the earth she's no ... lawyer\nWe

storyteller member of the black feet nation has to the pot cash break dances with wolves welcome you all to democracy now I'm let's go to North Dakota I'm too tired how SCA\nIf you can respond first to I'm a Senator Warren releasing her DNA test indicating a Native American lineage and her video and your thoughts on this\nWhat I see are some non native folks arguing over what native identity is\nI'm a native people just being in almost entirely left out of the conversation\nI'm so we saw that Lindsey Graham now is running around saying you know that I have more Indian blood than she does I should open a casino it kind of shows just how problematic\nI'm senator warns decision to use this DNA tests as her smoking gun now see I'm native I said I was\nUm when in fact you know common genetic markers and geographic location does not tell you anything about you know which tribe you might be a part of or that you might have this tendency from she couldn't actually locate an ancestor I'm having done a genealogy study who is a native person\nUm it's kind of this one drop rule that she is reinforcing all these you know understandings of race being something by blood and they're being the difference between um different ethnicities literally senator\nWarren and her own words in that video that she released on Monday talking about her Native American heritage\nNot enrolled in a tribal only trying to determine tribal citizenship and I understand members\nOf my family history is my family history and\nSo that's a Elizabeth Warren ... can you respond to that and also explain how is it a a that Native American tribes determine a membership\nYeah you know I think she's kind of walking back her words because she got this really harsh statement by turkey nation who is saying you know that this is really disrespectful and has nothing to do with um you know their sovereign right to determine membership\nUm you know I I don't think that she's very regretful about this I think that she's just kind of bold her way forward on this on this issue\nAnd you know yeah it's a sovereign right of tribal nations to determine who is a member it is in a relationship so Ken ship of community of\nYou know a lived experience it's all kinds of different factors that sometimes can include blood quantum but blood quantum is something that was created by the colonial government not by tribal nations um and it's this kind of myth that's been perpetuated by the United states and buy a many many Americans who claim to be quote unquote part Cherokee\nUm you know and continued as problematic ideas of who native people are and we're\n... let's turn to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends Tuesday saying he plans to take a DNA test in response to Senator Warren\nI'm going to take a day and it just all of us I've been told that my grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you go to find out in a couple of weeks ago so I'm going to take this new or going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be really old here this is my ... this is going to take what you and I just I'm dying to know why you know I didn't really think much about it but she's less than one tenth of one percent\nI think I can beat her I think I can beat her do breeder will us for a million dollars from the president you know I Want to casino enemy but [laughter]\nTo see you know in a million bucks to our house so that was Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\n[noise] yeah it's a it's incredibly disrespectful and you know she just really shows um\nHow warrants behavior although it's less crude than some of the comments have been made by Donald Trump about you know poke around us and demeaning women with this in a historic figure and making that into somehow for\n\nI don't have a\nChance to Jimmy ... by the group Smith says democracy now I Need any good and then within their means shape we\nEntered a show looking at the record number of Native American women running for office from the mid term elections that has never been a Native American woman Congress member this yet there are at least for indigenous women running for Congress three are running for governor and thirty one I'm running for seats in the state legislature\nWith us mark ... editor of Indian country today member of the ... tribes also with us in Fargo North Dakota ... house and national campaign director for honor the earth\nThe June ... from the coaching first nation in Seattle, Washington we're joined by Jesse Ross author speaker lawyer storyteller member of black feet nation has to the podcast break dances with wolves\nMarc let's go to you in Alaska even writing a lot about us in Indian country today about the record number of native women who are running for office in the United states\nIs just this week uh history was made when a Valerie Davidson became the lieutenant governor of Alaska the first Native American woman to hold out office than any state in the country\nUh she's ... she's one of a four other a native women running for lieutenant governor across the country in fact in Minnesota no matter what happens it'll be a Ojibwe woman who will be the next lieutenant governor of Minnesota red legged mission for the Republicans and daughter Bergstrom\nAnd a ... for the DFL in Minnesota so she's ... so this idea of just this year everything is just lit up a candidate\nA decided this was a time to round up hall is a great example um even though it's because of she said in her announcement because it was that Iraq and because of Donald Trump\nThere's also this long arc of she's been working at this for Twenty years and she was built to resume this ready for this job and that's part of the case and the story if you look around the countries are so many women who are prepared and this is the moment they chose to run\nSo could you talk about the contacts you said a ... being in office has something to do with it but how is it that that Native American women for the NIH's a to run in this election\nWell definitely the administration has policies was a motivating force particularly the policies that gives women\nUh this one of the great stories is how the Native American women candidates have created this network of early on I started reading about this I use that has said she representatives\nAnd a very soon after that uh the fashion designer Bethany yellow tail decided to make sure she calls she represents and list all of the Native American women running for office they formed an informal network they reach out to each other they support each other that help fund raise a Sharif said was a\n... together both in Kansas\nA pile of Jordan was at um\nA ... campaign the night of the primary win and making calls for knocking on doors the network they've created maybe the most lasting institution out of this whole election\nScott can you talk about what's happening in Minnesota and in Minnesota um you have a situation\nWhere no matter who wins on will be a Native American woman I'm we're talking about um the state representative penny Flanagan versus Republican uh John Bergstrom uh both running for lieutenant governor\n[noise] yeah you know that's been frustrating part I Would say about this whole Warren debacle and like the the concept of native identity being played out by two white folks um is that there is this historic\nYou know I'm representation of native women running across the country there's also you know the um the Indian child welfare act coming under coming under fire and the very core of federal Indian lobbying put into question by that\nUm there's the by and large pipeline in Minnesota where we're looking at you know to potential native women are going to hold the lieutenant governor said\nYou know at the same time we're looking at a a you know massive resistance of indigenous people um that his building against the line three project and bridges line three tar sands project that's actually where I'm coming from today um so you know we're\nSticking lane that while laying them para\nIndigenous representation I'm at the same time that is that we're trying to hold back the worst of what's happening\nExplain that you're deeply involved with pipeline politics whether we're talking about the Dakota access pipeline or whether we're talking about the current battle that you just mentioned\n[noise] yeah you know I think that native people as people who are still very connected to the land to the water are taking these leadership roles and fights all over the country and all around the world\nUm to protect the existing resources to protect the existing water resources for us all\nUm you know as I say to climate change raging around us um we're trying to protect the last of what's what's still remaining to us and protect our communities and protect those um around us for the next generation so as that's happening it's also in tandem with this with this rising up of women\nUm and particularly women of color and see representation but hopefully you know we can get a a good balance between the two so we're able to all survive as climate change is the greatest problem facing this world\nAnd Kara um how important is that women were also leading the battle against the Dakota access pipeline and inspiring when a new or in a North Dakota right now I wanted to talk about the Supreme Court I'm In North Dakota\nI'm and also indigenous activists fighting a daily battle in the swamp plan to Louisiana against the bayou bridge pipeline one sixty three mile pipeline being built by energy transfer partners the same company behind the apple\nUm water protectors have repeatedly been arrested for protesting and face felony charges under harsh new anti protest law signed by Louisiana's governor\nEarlier this year pipeline construction scheduled to end before the new year\nI think that women as we've seen with me too movement really building and we've seen the women's march and we've seen women being the backbone of so many different movements faces including um you know indigenous\nA resistance against these extractive industry projects um it's women taking on this role of leadership that's sorely sorely needed it's women record recognizing that missing murdered indigenous women as a epidemic across this country across the across Canada\nUm that these can be directly that these ... cases of ah women can be directly tied to the extracted extractive industry\nUm and also sitting here in North Dakota where I Know there's many women organizers rushing to try to get people I'm home address is that they can actually participate in the election and the very notion of indigenous people not being able to participate in the election of a country that started after\nUm our nation's existed you know it's women taking on so many different roles and I think it's something that is really really needed in this time it's very critical time of potentially are very survival I'm being called into question with the latest reports of what's happening and we're we're out with climate change\nAnd Jesse of us could you also comment on that issue the issue of of voter ID laws that could potentially a restrict uh the the pipe is a patient of Native Americans and the

news\nYeah well I mean just five you treated among other people you said there is an exodus of women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump and again yeah the matter how they try to keep spending this cabinet stuff and Trump's ego women loved in women are very angry about the Democrat hoax at like ... no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women or women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has CNN's new generic ballot will has women opting for democratic candidates sixty three ... thirty three gender gap as the net thirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time\nAbout this blue wave is going to be female but I also say what you say

well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality of what we kinda are in a place where we have to scare our own people into voting you know

just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door\nThey come down\nTo vote but I mean it's true but I think we're underestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so\nWho are fed up and and now's the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted weed out of the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party yeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know Bob I think I'm like I was saying it it is an interesting I mean ... tweeted a yes the electorate has was transformed this November we will experience in Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so voting early as ... keep saying voting by mail was a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr own a lot of these machines broke who sell well\nYeah and and as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans what I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of

had to admit it and then um I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister and I didn't know that until it was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying to when you hear these things are six deaths that it's not just one victim it's many it's the the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue continues escalate they find new victims so when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ... or\nDo they slide and you know knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believe you but didn't yet believe that it was at all and that is that it was\nThe other members of my family looked me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was even what um\nIf it was fall spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white substance on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that's done to me for the rest of my life\nAnd when I told my other family members they said well I Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe it's him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want to either hand yeah hurts and that you're telling me because they can't handle that\nWell that's what this was so egregious people react in so much to this Catherine that was just another layer of of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her second one so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the U.S and so\nOf course not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for\nThe Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him and his face is what five inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah he knows right at you and she knows all the obviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean\nThe fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was ever nominated I mean it's just I yeah I yeah I ... I couldn't watch her whole speech I was like on she just apparently there's a lot of women who've\nBeen raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that that is the dividing line all the men are innocent of that and\nIn this part that she believes him about really he's poor perjured himself how many times but she believes in about ...\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn presidents are all the time\nThey aren't overturned all the time there and listen to the standards that he put forward his conversation with me and also a ... in the here and he says for president a long established precedent like road to be overturned\nIt would have to have been gravy a slave wrong and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in answer the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not locals twenty twenty would obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed into Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but I'm the upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\n\n... we\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard me could present ski go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere is something that you're right about whether to Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just this rate the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kind of like ... again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh so you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just like sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr Ford did don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women you know you need to be responsible for their own blah blah blah well\nIt's something I treated recently it's Ninety to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other time\nThere is no suddenly they're all mine and that's what they want you to believe so that means yeah if you're\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women who are obviously credible and a half a cooperating witness was they've been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report the thing that the truth of it\nIs that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said this that the white women are our first a a barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and a white man's first degree of saying he's lying if not him\nThat whole discuss things get Trump did you know about the\nMother or grandmother mother I'd been unfairly mom mom what am I going to do like you know just before again as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash of of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's a yeah\nOkay so uh Kellyanne Conway\nOh there are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we can get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again I go visit her speech justice Kavanaugh justice cabin all I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes roe versus Wade is a federal law\n[noise] please write he wouldn't be on this list if ... if you was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just it's [noise]\nYou know what kills me is you don't like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get on the oceans but their mistresses you know and it ... it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses speak of is not going to end I think what people have to recognize that\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves it I said the system was working exactly as it was designed by white right conservative med\nIt worked perfectly they got Kavanaugh he will control women's bodies you will control whether Trump is brought down or not he will do exactly what they want it the system worked for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nThis is what the rhetoric the always uses it stuff like this coming on Conway said\nTo be pro choice in two thousand Eighteen names that your first sex selection abortion

survivors don't like our protest tactics I guess we should just smile and say please nicely maybe them they'll decide to overthrow patriarchy in white supremacy\nOr we must stop immediately because it turns out voters in Republican strongholds don't like it when we raise our voices Neal at sporting events tell our stories of survival are generally exist so we must stop doing all this immediately so as not to offend said Republicans\nUm you're absolutely right I mean have they ever read a book about the history of protests [laughter] yeah in this country\nSometimes I Wonder if they have and then I have to remember that these are all kinds of little toxic to run by a\nIn theory there that are Democrats doing the same thing as saying we're going to go out there are those who believe that a true democracy those who the the power and\nYou know a true multi racial society we're going to go after those boat\nFor some reason there are a number of Democrats who think our past the power is going to find people who have never vote for Democrats before only tied at one time and that ... that could have an energizing them that we know that actually went back to our country\nThis must have infuriated you are even more than me listening to Mitch McConnell said this to take\nA look I mean they have been after all of us who are shorter than under assault and everybody decided to stand up to the mall you know they're not\nThey're not being terminated bothers people I'm just couldn't be prouder among members for refusing to roll over on her all of the nation township pressure always loved\n[noise] um so this is they didn't they didn't call the\nPeople in Charlottesville a mob the angry Nazis with torches women trying to speak their truth and trying to be heard I mean you probably saw the tape of a Orrin Hatch like literally with his hand like chewing women away\nAnd saying you know grow up [laughter] I mean it's hard to imagine and making it worse but somehow they have on every level ...\nI mean like I was there [noise] you know George Wallace awful stood up for protesters\nAnd history has started to be completely on the wrong side and that will do it with McConnell and these cowardice Republicans as well but let's be clear that they are fundamentally like these women are not us all take that and use that language about survivors of acceptable sexual assault is guns disgusting\nYeah they're they're ... they're rich white men to control all three branches of government but somehow there the the uh the aggrieved party here they're the victims\nAnd we you know this is what we want to encourage people to do I know the country with food when they saw on a Maria odd and Maria Gallagher in that\nElevator talking to Jeff Flake but what folks who don't understand is that there were hundreds of other women who have taken that exact same type of action maybe not in the elevator and maybe in a stairwell in a hallway at an airport at a coffee shop in front of people's houses that\nHundreds of women had taken that action a bird dog before it ever went viral with ana Maria Maria\nAnd so you know we're really encouraging people to make their voices heard you know we made thousands of called people showed up at ... miles to try to have a meeting with their senator and they would not be with us it would not answer calls they were giving their constituents to run around and\nThat this was a tactic in that they dislike because it forces them to actually see their position\nWe'll turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from ... in an airport in went into it in a men's bathroom he was probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assault them that he would not want this band or any other ban accountable for it so you know\nThat's why they just like it that's why they tried to discredit it because\nYou know they decided to be public servants and then they didn't like what the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their accent\nYeah I mean ... ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just how the human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean just ... yeah I I mean we were talking about this clip did you see this clip of Lauryn room in the southern ... on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a

across the globe like the the the lack of the u._s. being any type of ballast starts to open up a huge can of worms\nOh absolutely and I think I mean I even read an article this past week\nI'm dating from some buddy quoted from within the inner circle or some association with the inner circle in Saudi Arabia\nThat one of the reasons why in the ... ... Mohammed bin Salman young current too is in charge of Saudi Arabia at the moment and who is very likely to have been the person who ordered this a gruesome killing in Turkey\nThat he was highly influenced by two things one that they finally put and has been getting away with assassinating dissidents and and you know people he considers to have betrayed and in foreign countries and you know it just everyone seems to be shrugging over that and I know ramifications for anyone\nAnd second that um you know Donald Trump has been has been harshly criticizing the media as despicable Scott I'm you know the worst people in the world nothing but dishonest\nAnd it led him to believe that this would not be\nKnow that would cause him any any serious blow back and that what it would do is sort of exert his own authority and power not just within his own kingdom but also you know this is a pretty aggressive move against\nTurkey and its own way and you know what we're seeing here is a lot of jockeying for power in the middle east Iran Turkey Saudi Arabia or Israel and these various set you know sort of shifting alliances and it's all\nComplicated but particularly complicated by the fact that you know Russia is now involved in the middle east and the way it hasn't been in many years and you've got Trump who you know is on the one hand ah advised by a naive princeling a Jared Kushner\nAnd who has very little understanding of the complexities of these relationships or the consequences of\nYou know making the sort of move and on the other hand he's got some hardcore right wing ideologues were essentially working on behalf of Israel to\nConfront that Ron and so you know this is a very very very volatile situation\nAnd this has thrown a bomb in the middle of some plans that wherever the New York times reported last week that that the Trump Administration had been planning to stage a major confrontation with Iran in November\nOver and and and basically I Try to isolate them by uh sabotaging their oil sales\nYup which of course what and and this would with the with the backing Saudi Arabia of course you would regret it reduced prices are up there\nUm you know there are oil production or whatever that this was it you know a big grand plan that this has somehow disrupted because now Trump is sort of having to you know I mean he's not doing very well because he's basically saying hey you know stuff happens what can I say [noise]\nUm but you know this is a very very volatile situation and and and just before I stop here the the the one thing I heard that was very interesting to me about how this might affect the midterms is it this has been the most sustained\nCoverage of a foreign policy events since Donald Trump came into office and I don't know whether that means anything important but it sure seems like it might that maybe this\nIs going to have some effect on on their terms\nI mean it's possible I mean in in in a book before we get there I mean I think you raise a couple of their their ... two aspects right but I think are becoming clearer and this is something that you and I have have touched upon or every couple of months over the last couple of years which is what what are going to be the implications\nIn the context of of foreign policy\nWhich is an administration that is I'm a on some level fundamentally incompetent in so far is that um they they're understaffed\nThe day are inexperienced they are are running our foreign policy in the same way that you would if you were a\nSmall under a undeveloped a nation without a democracy right or they are running our foreign policy as if we were not a nation\nAnd and regardless of of of one's perspective on how much of a source of of good we are in the world right I mean because I think uh\nPeople have a range of perspectives on that\nWhat we were indisputably was a consistent watershed that would change our policies perhaps at the margins but fundamentally there were certain things that didn't even need to be articulated on a regular basis that in some ways a impacted\nAnd regulated the behavior of other countries and when we come back we'll take a break when we come back I Want to talk about that element of it because there's really two elements to this there's there is the sort of the the mechanics of foreign policy and then there's sort of the more broad\nUm messages that we send to the rest of the world that are not necessarily um a tactical or strategic in any way up but they have big implications for the way the rest of the world\nFunctions

protesters in Manhattan here to tell us about this group of self described western chauvinists Angelou curse soon the president of media matters\nSo Angela let's just start with who are the Proud Boys\nThe or a probably the most well organized part of the men's rights movement and so basically the Proud Boys um are are there would describe themselves as western chauvinists\nAnd that's just to put it simply they have chapters they they do meetings um you know they're not just sort of like participants\nOnline forums like I think a lot of the men's rights movements are they actually do stuff in public or as as we are now saying\nOkay we used to I mean we we got to get a go a little broader than that because ah I I just think that the\nUm everything you just said probably strikes normal people as being yeah absolutely\nWe have a group of adult males who are you having their ah twenties thirties their leader I think is a late forties uh Gavin began this we'll ... we'll get to him in a moment\nAnd they all wear Fred Perry color shirts and they are in a basically he\nMan or women heater a non\nWestern civilization hater group is I mean it's like it's like a like a like a youth group but for theoretically grown men\nThat's right and they they consider themselves to be sort of like fraternal order um they have levels\nA participation so like the first level is actually you actually have to identify yourself officially as a proud boy um and you have to make that a publicly known statement it's not something that you shy away from you have to actually explicitly say that\nIdentify that in some of your either public communications or on your social media profiles that you have to make it known 'em the second level is when things start to get\nA little stranger hum you have to commit to giving up masturbation\nUm it's a really important part of moving through the ranks um and it's something that they insist people commit to as they sort of go through it and then the applies a part of that initiation what happens is is that\nYou get beat up by other ... members of higher rank while you lift your five favorite cereals and then the third part of it\nIs when you actually get attached to her moaning and then you're saying these things like they're not absolutely bizarre you've got to have computer while you're standing on your five favorite breakfast cereals\nYeah yeah like and it's a real thing these are places that have these are they are a pretty well organized group but they've been growing pretty steadily the last couple of years because they're tapping into\nThis sort of energy that is uh that that is sort of percolate within the larger anti PC men's rights movement and so it's just like a funnel you sort of start with big picture kind of stuff and then you slowly you know recruit people in work them down the fourth level is where it gets\nScary though and and sort of what goes from being we're to sort of scary that\nActually the highest level of being a proud boy is when you commit violence for the cause that's what they describe it\nAnd uh it is it is the most honored thing you can do um and you are recognized as such when you get to that level and the what we saw on friday a ... in New York City it wasn't just that it was an outlier or random example of the Proud Boys are sort of getting into a scuffle\nWhat they had was a moment where some of them could commit violence for the cause and sort of earn that badge of honor and that distinction and it's intentional um and when Gavin McGinnis founded it he described it very proudly as a gang or he really believes that there needs to be sort of a pro violence movement\nAt the tip of the spear for the larger you know men's rights and anti PC movement and he's pretty unabashed about the fact that violence as a as a necessary ineffective tool and you know it's and that's kind of where the the sort of the culture part of it comes in right that\nWhen you're sort of moving people through those levels of part of that is actually to indoctrinate and to get people comfortable I'm just like any game\nWith increasing levels of\nUm activities so it goes from being sort of strange in weird to can you know starting to create those moments of hazing and more intense camaraderie to outwardly conditioning people and incentivizing acts of violence\nIf you know what is this all about where they don't masturbate and how do they um I mean we'll get onto the more serious aspects of it but it's you know people should know this is a very bizarre a group\nAnd I happen to uh have known Gavin McGinnis as socially uh years ago we will we will talk about that in a moment but what is the theory behind telling the members of this gang\nThat you're not allowed to masturbate and how do they regulate that\nThey I think it's I think it's an honor system and uh and and I think that's really a part of it at the the theory behind that I I I think is partly connected to a few things one is that there's this\nIt's it's ... touch yourself I'm a little bit so little ... or ... or this is according to sort of their tenants there there's this this hyper masculinity associated with being a proud boy I'm which seems strange given the name but\nAnd that even doing that act alone is somehow a part of it um the deeper peace though is less about they're hyper masculine approach and actually more about creating a shared sacrifice and to incentivize\nMore group activities the ideas that you know when somebody moves to that level of commitment it's actually coincides with a with a hazing experience and a piece of that is actually that\nUm you know you're you're sort of bonding a little bit more with with the group and it's it's like a gang right the idea is to really tether you more to to a community in a weird way than to yourself um and so as a part of that presumably and and as a typically is the case you actually spend more time\nI'm at ... meetings um and with other Proud Boys and you sort of move deeper into this this this organization\nNow you refer to this gang as a being centered around the men's rights movement and I'm a and in western chauvinist ... why do you not use the term white supremacist\nI think that that's too easy into simple and I actually think that it's not because I don't think that they inherit that has a part of their\n... it's not because I don't think that race is a a a big piece of their organizing principle I I I\nBut there I just it's just too simple and I think these days the sort of knee jerk reaction oftentimes as as they when these things break into the public is because we think about this kind of activity activity in the past\nTypically associated with white nationalist and white supremacists and because that's often are frame of reference that's immediately where we go to when we see groups like this because it feels very similar and there's no doubt that bigotry and racism and\nAnd very much anti out to be the discrimination are part of their brand but it's bigger than that um and it isn't purely limited they they're organizing principle is not around race um in fact\nA as evidence of that actually I Am Proud Boys meetings um is where actual white nationalist organizations will try to find recruits because there tends to be very intense alignment\nUm but it it isn't this or this there the organizing principle and so I think it's a ... I I think it's just a little misleading and\nThey have the people of color that are part of the ... community um and so when when you say that they're white nationalist group and then they like it it actually makes it harder\nTo to get to what they're really organizing around and I that's the part that scares me because they are much more appealing um than than say the white nationalist are\nUm when you look at Charlottesville what you saw on display at Charlottesville not the night of the tiki torches but on that Saturday when they're all those people they're one of the ways that so many came together was that\nWas that ... chapters had actually activated themselves as well as other men's rights organizations to say go out and protest political correctness um and so there is something a\nMuch more appealing and brought about that than simply you know white genocide and you know white culture is dying and being destroyed and so I I think it's important to be to be aware of that\nAll right well Angela or we're going to take a break when we come back um or want to ah talk a little bit more about how they see themselves in terms of these these shock troops for\nThe conservative movement that you call that I think we can say is you know they're white supremacist friendly right like they are allies of these folks are and then let's talk about Gavin beginning\nBecause it's reflective of a deeper environment\nAnd got an makes his money are largely because Mike Wiggins is new boss uh met he's in bed with a really big media company cumulus rate cumulus media which is the second largest radio company out there um has a subdivision called Westwood One that actually distributed program a to companies that pay for it to a man that's mostly how he makes his his his repetition\nYou get older that on air over terrestrial radio is that just threw a C. R. T. V.\nThey had tried very aggressively through ... and it wasn't clear to me to the river are able to accept spaghetti contracts the TV and then some of some smaller digital distribution deals\nInteresting and who's ... is it just strictly a corporate thing and I have people basically said hey why are you um why is this major corporation a supporting literally brown shirts bugs\nIt's weird because she our TV basically paid Westwood One for gabbing McGinnis this program\nThat's how it's so Marco events companies see our TV pays Westwood One which is that really big radio company for that for those distribution right for the distribution rights I mean there are probably the largest footprint that he has\nA right now what what has not been successful\nBut they have other programs that they've been adding that are very similar to get him to get it they're just not that much further those programs they had they had had success of getting to trust your radio show in a way\nThe whole idea behind gathered and it's kind of like the over the window right is that if you're the tip of the year and you're really far out there maybe you're not power that you created taste in the audience his mouth for something that is\nThat is close to that but maybe just not that far over the line and that's the thing that I feel the net effect of all this is not just the violence but how they constantly\nMoving further and further ... thank you so much for your time today really breaking Patricia\n... is the president of media matters\nWhen we come back Heather did be pardoned will join us to analyze more news from the past week that just ahead um same cedar\nYou're listening to ring of fire radio don't forget R O F ... dot com year well you've been missing and to support the show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd my main count on on\nOn on on how\nThey did in Albuquerque for granted talk aims thirteenth ... it's a little everywhere you want to let them on our street I honestly the Iran downloading now hey ...\nKnown laying in a\nDay and my mom\nAnd they did a ...\nNew deal um then you can ...\n\nHey you\nKnow medium between\nOne man\nGod and ...\nNew one man\nMean I'm\nMore you know that if\n\n\nLeft\nNa na\nNa\nMe in a way to deal\nI'm In a\nNew thing in\n\nIn a\n\nUm you know so\n\n\nJew oh\nI'm thinking that\nWe man the\nUse\nLake is\n[noise]\nNa na\nNa na na\n\nNa\nNa\nNa\nNa\nNa\nNa na\nNa\nNa na\nNa na\nNa\nOh\nWow\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWow [noise]\n\nNa na [noise]\n\nNa\nNa\nNa na [noise]\n\n\n\n\nHa ha\nHa\n\nHa ha [noise] canceling\nOther green but marching toward America I'm Krista ...

corresponded Frederick like good news in Moscow this\nLet's not forget what we're talking about our rape survivors who came to Washington and they cornered senators in the hallway and in elevators to tell them their stories and begged them not to vote for Brett Kavanaugh I mean apparently they these men found that very threatening um\nAnd the truth or large they get their ... they ...\nThey didn't and they knew they knew that this was not you know in any way physically intimidating the protests were nothing compared to the protests and the town halls and twenty ten over Obamacare and in fact I put up some video\nOn one of my piece in salon last week that showed you remember they spit on on Republican or democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver and screamed and John Lewis this faces they were trying to walk across the grounds I mean it was intense and really had a very violent feeling about it [noise]\nUm so you know no ... they were not physically intimidated and my personal feeling is that they that this was actually an elaborate troll on the part of the Republican senators first of all to try and get past their\nUm you know they're they're kind of shame a over the cabin up business\nBut also to try and intimidate democratic lawmakers into distancing themselves from their pet I support\nI mean this idea that you know and and the media jumped right on it too oh look you know the violent mob there there's mob action and oh they're going up to people in in restaurants and that's just terrible and look how out of control and civil they all are\nCalling for civility civility ah that's just a method to try and get Democrats to disown condemn their own supporters and so far I haven't seen much evidence that Democrats are doing that which is\nSomewhat surprised I mean normally they would I mean that's usually a pretty effective a ploy on the part of the Republicans um and it does fire up their base um but that has been\nYou know this has been not ... this idea of of this angry mob actually goes back to the moment when Donald Trump was inaugurated and the n._r._a. and mediate came out of the box\nAh with this um campaign called the the fist of the righteous fist of truth I think it's called that\nClenched fist of truth sorry and it was run by Dana Lowe's and and what it was was this idea that antifa and the resistance where all the same thing and they were more rotting in the streets and getting ready to burn down your your town\nAnd they put out a whole series of those ads and they've been pumping that from the very beginning I mean that's been going on for two years\nSo this idea that there is this angry mob is sort of turning underneath and that leads us to these groups like the Proud Boys\nThey're positioning themselves as the as the defense\nAgainst the left wing angry mob right I mean that is how that's being how that's being sold in right wing circles that these guys are protecting themselves and the scariest part of that Proud Boys um incident\nIs the fact that the cops seemed to be on the Proud Boys side\nRight because there were antifa outside the event and they were\nSigns and screaming at them and what have you they didn't start the violence but that was sort of how the cops perceived it that they were provoking the Proud Boys and they kind of that I mean if you saw the videos you could say that they were not exactly aggressive and stopping the beating rather than we are taking place\nSo I think that that's sort of where that part of it is leading and and and part of camping this idea of the violent left wing mob mostly bunch of women wearing pink cats\nUm is to sort of give them the excuse in case\nThis does sort of escalate and I see it escalating with or without Trump you know without winning the midterms are without you know anything this is something that's happening sort of organically on the right\nAnd it's really really dangerous I mean you see those red hats on cops and you see those red hats on those Proud Boys and you're kind of going you know this is not a\nThere are some historical parallels that are disturbing fatally\nAnd we should say it was a U.S congressman staffer who set this event up at the Republican metropolitan club\nRight right I mean so this is not at arm's like I mean the idea of of a Democratic Congress person setting up a you know\nI'm a black block\nOr a group of people use black bloc tactics to speak at a democratic club is\nUnlikely to say the least and uh the outrage would be enormous um you know the um\nI think there's a misconception uh amongst people as to who a so called anti uh people are right this is a people who are simply fighting against fascist\nOr to be distinguished from you know black bloc ah people use black bloc tactics a ... but I think that you know in the\nIn the popular conception of these are the same things but neither group and anti fucking be just a teacher who was a you know trying to um [noise]\nUh identify you

simple favor handling a\nBatch your weekend box office preview on I heard\nWelcome back during a fire radio I'm Sam cedar Sears has been a household name for almost a hundred and twenty five years but now the retail giant is facing bankruptcy\nHere to tell us how hedge fund king stands to make a lot of money over the failure of the company he was running Eileen Appelbaum co director of the center for economic and policy research\nSo Eileen this week a Sears after a\nI'm a along well I guess maybe not that long but it's certainly a precipitous decline over the past ah less than a\nDecade filed for bankruptcy and uh the easy I think for seal a explanation is that they just couldn't compete in this day and age of the Internet but that's not nearly the most accurate story is\nNo ah what's true is that the a retail market place as changed a lot uh in in recent years a but this is an industry that is constantly facing disruption of one kind or another and that uh\nHas learned to deal with disruption so for example every time we have a recession\nA this is a problem for anybody who's involved in retail because you don't need a new dress you don't need a new so suit you you buy as little as possible of things and and just make do or if you're worried about your job and certainly if you've lost your job and become unemployed you you don't have the ability to spend so\nPeriodically retailers face that kind of disruption\nThey face disruption from changing styles there is of course a lot of change in the marketplace the question is why a company like seers as big as successful as a\nEngraved in the in the memories of uh of everybody who grow up in the U.S why it was unable to respond and for that I think you have to look to the fact that they were owned and managed and run by a hedge fund\nThat had little interest in Syria succeeding more interest in lining their own pockets\nNow I mean okay ... and we should say also and we were talking about Sears it's not like fears is not familiar with the idea of people not coming into the stores to buy things they they invented the notion practically of if not invented the notion of of ordering remotely and having it shipped to you\nBut let's put that aside for a moment\nConceptually speaking and I think this is difficult for people to understand because we have seen the story though now are increasingly we've certainly seen it in the past you start with Toys R us we start with Ankara hockey we saw with I think sports authority um\n... what we what we have conceptually and I want you to walk us through it and tell us who the players are but it it tell me if this characterization conceptually makes sense\nThere is a quality to when when the c._e._o. and when the hedge fund essentially Mary's with Sears by Sears and gets into a union with them it's as if they know they're going to get divorced\nSeven eight years down the road right when the kids go to college we're going to get divorced and what they do is they start basically bleeding the the the household income of money in burying it in the back and uh by the end of this thing the the marriage as an entity has a lot of debt\nThey hidden money or in the back yard and they walk away essentially that's that's what we're looking at here right\n[noise] but I think that's a very a very good analogy that are in fact when ever\nA these companies are bought by private equity they're they're intended to be sold in just a few years this story is has it has its own little twist to it because the earth remained a publicly traded company and a Edward ... an\nESL his hedge funds what hedge funds do is they\nTake over they take over control of publicly traded companies and so\nUh if the share price goes up they're happy to continue holding it or if the share price goes down and they have other ways of making money which in this case they clearly did a than they're happy to do it that way I I Will say that Edward lamport an ESL his hedge fund adopted a lot a lot of the practices\nYou see with private equity taking resources out of the company owning more than half of it so that they could actually dictate ah and and and this was in some ways even more extreme because Edwards Lambert not only is the founder of the hedge fund that\nBought up all of their bought up so much of their stock but he became the c._e._o. as the years he became the chairman of the board of directors of Sears he is the head of the trust fund that uh that owns the earth ah he lent them tons of money which he he let\nHis ... his hedge fund lend money to see her as a which he and his hedge fund or collecting interest payments uh I'm situated themselves\nShould there be a bankruptcy so the and the cat bird seed in terms of figuring out\nWho gets paid into bankruptcy and who takes the losses so he has covered every base there is\nAnd ... and so and just so people understand we have a situation I mean I think the first inclination of most people have to assume oh someone is a a a CEO of a company and they own if not the majority of the stock in a pluralistic plea or you know largest amount of the stock\nThey of course want that company to succeed but he extracted so much\nWealth out of this and and just to be clear on this bankruptcy thing as as the son of a bankruptcy attorney\nWhen a company goes into bankruptcy there is a hierarchy of creditors are people who are owed money who get paid first he made sure because he was on both ends of the deal that in the event of a bankruptcy and I'm not convinced from the story that he didn't know that a bankruptcy was\nA notable in fact drove the company towards is that he would get paid first in way down on the list\nAre of course obviously the workers who would lose their jobs but those people who had deferred compensation in the form of a pension who are going to get a screwed on this as well All right so let's talk first about\nIllegal things they may be doing on the tax side uh we don't have an FCC with teeth in it that goes after these companies for anything illegal they are doing in terms of investors I mean fears but actually sued by some of its shareholders over this real estate deal and had to pay out a\n... a many millions of dollars to\nPeople who had sued them over what they did but it but it didn't undo the deal\nThey weren't all know that was illegal you can't do it uh and so where the heck is the SEC Lambert is not the only and veterans fears\nWhere is the SEC went this is going on where is the SEC when this real estate a thing solved off and such an obvious fashion to a company also on that you pointed out by the same hedge fund when they become the Laurie how do we let them become both the largest\nDebtor and the largest holder of equity how is that possible because it's that's the largest debtor that they can range that bankruptcy so that it pays them first\nAnd that's what we're looking forward to um unless the bankruptcy court there is one last possibility here and that is that the bankruptcy court will rule\nThat these were conflicts of interest which anybody looking with their eyes can see these conflicts of interest but if I'm wrong that those were conflicts of interest than in fact lab for its plans to balance the benefits and the bankruptcy is not going to happen but\nNobody thinks that a bankruptcy court is not going to hold them accountable either\nWhat it would anti trust laws I mean we have anti trust laws on the books that did that in the eighties we had a change in the way that these laws are interpreted by regulators and by legislators in many respects by the courts\nA but a return to these sort of pre a Bork in uh Chicago school anti trust 'em uh premises would that help in any way\nI don't know that that is so relevant for this case it's definitely relevant for a lot of private equity examples that I won't go into here but\nA private equity would have done is to have bought one company and then added on\nMany many many smaller companies in the ... a big chunk of the market\nThese guys that were never planning to do that here they were never planning to make serious any kind of a success as you as you've already pointed out and so\nThey didn't they didn't follow that kind of a strategy and all they did was to suck resources out of the earth\nAnd enriched themselves in the process and when it looked like seers was really going to go under they hatched a plan to set up a real estate investment trust to own the real estate so that they could make money out of that they felt two hundred and sixty six properties\nSo that real estate investment trust it so it's so attractive that bought Warren Buffett has invested in it\nYeah I I made I mean do you getting these things at the very least maybe market rate and uh you got a guaranteed client until then a you'll find some other a client after the fact I got to say this is just\nA it's incredible it's a problem that we've seen with different companies or we're going to continue to see it until there is some type of regulation but this type of a vulture capitalism right ... thank you so much for your time today I really appreciate\nThank you very much Eileen apple bomb is the co director of the center for economic and policy research Washington D.

studio during a brand new episode with the legendary thing sort of all my garden\nMe no arming treat them with Joel levy talking about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band called meet all that we were views when we're playing music or radio print media sorry about no\nAround downloading now [noise]\n[noise] [noise] sure [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nNo\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThat they have it's the one where they stood on the steps of the capital and you know they all grand than glad hand didn't cheer Donald Trump and called him a genius and all this stuff I mean and it is it is lethal to them and so I think you know there is\nA sense that maybe they're shtick is not working anymore in a lot of ways I mean this economy should be enough\nFor them to win a or at least do better and certainly Donald Trump's approval rating should be higher but the problem is is that I think you know people have come to sort of see what the scam is now maybe I'm being too optimistic here but I mean this is a con that they have run for nearly Thirty years\nWhich is that they run up deficits with huge military spending and tax cuts for wealthy and corporations [noise]\nThen they end up you know screwing the pooch in some way and the the ... they ended up losing the White House and often a you know the one or more houses of Congress at that point they turn around and start screaming about deficits\nIn a in an attempt to get that to force the Democrats to cut spending and by spending they almost always means signature programs of the Democratic party which are the safety net programs\nSocial Security Medicare Medicaid and now will undoubtedly be Affordable Care act as part of that too so that is their method of trying to you know at the very least contain Democrats from trying to do anything more to help people like Medicare for all\nAnd at ... at most to hopefully get them on board to try and to start cutting these social welfare programs\nOr that the big ones that that are across the board and you know they've actually had some success in some ways I mean Bill Clinton talked about privatizing Social Security at one point rock Obama put cutting Social Security\nOn that on the agenda as part of his grand bargain and each time it didn't go through for a variety of reasons mostly because Republicans wouldn't take yes for an answer but it's a weapon\nThat they have deployed over and over again and so one of the reasons why they do these big tax breaks aside from rewarding their big donors in corporate sponsors\nIs to put the Democrats in this kind of a bind where they are stuck as they inevitably will be because you know maybe in this case they actually know Donald Trump was you know hardly going to be a successful president otherwise\nThey would stick the Democrats with this big bill and then they would have to be in this position of you know talking about cutting programs again you can already see it happening and the media by the way are the worst enablers of this scam\nBecause they love to sit around and talk about how you know the people really need to understand they've got to tighten their belts and take their medicine and we can't afford it and they need to sacrifice and\nYou know all this stuff these rich celebrities on television and sit there and lecture the American people about how they have to give up Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nSo they helped the Republicans every time and I thought just happened this week when Mitch McConnell came out with his\nUm comments that said well you know when when asked about the soaring deficit which you know a deficit hawk like him should have been a\nPie by and he said well if not a Republican part problem it's a bipartisan problem driven by entitlements right so I mean this is it an immediate\n... we did we raise a the Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits or by Seventeen percent in the past year I mean it's you know ... point but then that's what it would mean\nYeah I mean that's exactly what it would mean and that's you know and and the thing is is that you know everybody went well but what about the tax cuts and it turned into another one of those arguments\nBut it doesn't seem to me that that the voters are buying it if you look at polling and the way that they're sort of responding to this economy they're giving Republicans a very tiny within the margin of error\nUm advantage in approval for running the economy which seems odd to me you know we're two years in Trump should be able to take some credit for all this and they're really not getting it and they're not getting a you know they're they're not doing well with their with their tax cuts\n... ... what's your take on this\nWell I think it's definitely true that you know this and I'm ... and Muller probably in his own way was happy to have this election come up because it gave him a chance to keep working for for a couple of months\nOr to make their tough on stuff and at one point three I'm said we're going to get out of his business because stuff is bad\nRight right yeah I mean you know the three of them and do\nHot new you know very early on that there were problems with this chemical\nOn finally reached a point where three and said we're going to stop making it as you said and rather than saying okay then you know we're going to switch to du pont\nWho was you know buying ... from three am rather than stopping and ... and switching gears to find something safe are they just began manufacturing the chemical themselves\nShow you know three of\nUs you know ... obsessively did the right thing and switching ... some might argue that they should have done so earlier um but they will stop using it and making it all and Groupon didn't they just added that to their portfolio of things are going to go ... when al ... and other money maker for them\nNo monitors a three I'm at the time had basically said du pont listen when you're working with this chemical\nThe only way to get rid of it is the only way to get rid of it is to burn a because it doesn't have a half life it just doesn't go way doesn't diminish you got to burn it and dupont went ahead and said oh\nThat may be a little bit too pricey let's just dump\nExactly yeah so I mean the documents clearly state uh you know whatever you do do not trust us into the water do not get it in the water and and it was just dumping it into the water that eventually ended up you know contaminating much of the Ohio River valley\nAnd so All right so how do we first get when I mean this starts this is one of those stories that is is pretty amazing it starts with just one former who notices that his cows are dying in a very strange way tell us about that\nYeah so I'm old tenant at a farm in Parkersburg West Virginia and he issued a permit to do ... that they could run their waste water by their string but they had you know in their description of what they would be running it never included anything that would be toxic when he started noticing was that\nHave water was being filled with this foamy it looks like it looks like ... century the spot me substance and suddenly a couch started dying off one at a time and there were here on the property and fish were dead\nAnd you know he he made several calls have you tried to get help and nobody would listen to have um you know in his own words he says they sort of wrote him off as an old dumb farmer and he was anything but an old dumb farmer he\nWas really persistent and he started documenting these I mean insofar as that he would autopsy that counts himself and he filmed at all it's all on them\nUm and you know dupont got wind of it and we know this because of the depositions of the do pot lawyers who warn me no none too pleased that he was making a stink about this and they you know sort of hope that they could discredit him as you know a disgruntled or [noise]\nOr you know just it's just kind of a crazy old man but they knew something was going to happen and and you know they from their own words that one of the lawyers Bernard Reilly says you know just about to hand because the farmer is on to us um\nAnd indeed he was so eventually he settled with dupont and we don't really know the terms of that settlement but\nWhat we do know is that normally the case would end there and things would sort of go quietly into the night but\nWhat happened what to do contest to send out a letter to their residence saying hey just see you know there there is a little bit of this water the the chemical in your drinking water and don't worry we've measured it totally safe for you know we're basically required to let you know that and that was on death row Parkersburg\nBut one of the people that got it was a gym teacher by the name of Joe ... and this just didn't sit right perhaps you know initially he sort of put it aside and he's like oh you know it it's like the letters you get in the mail about your eyes on that you never read right on\nBut he read it and it kept sort of sticking in his mind when he started seeing that people in the neighborhood or just proportionately sick with testicular cancer and rotten teeth and\nAh he started digging around and he did what I think very few people would do is he was relentless about making phone calls and he was calling the EPA and just I mean really you know really going above and beyond the call of duty to try and figure out what this was\nAnd you know after some digging he eventually was sent the case of or some of the the description of what happened to Earl tenant\nAnd in that those dealings he found the name of the lawyer that handled the attendant case which was Rob a lot and so he called Robin ... told him about this letter and rebel I agreed to take his case so\nIn some way I think you know ... ... was first on to the fact that it was the surface water that was being contaminated by the runoff from the company and that's the case that Rob a lot settled for him but then what Robert was keyed into but this is also in the drinking water so that became another case as well too\nSo I'm a ... in a ... point temporarily speaking were like in the early aughts right I mean this was almost a Fifteen some odd years ago [noise] um yeah Rob ... gets on the case and then what happens next is something that in the uh the course of\nOf of tort law we rarely see ah as far as I Know and um when we were going to take a break when we come back\nWe'll hear about the the independent the case that the following Rob ... picked it up\nAnd the methodology that the court determines that decided upon which is a pretty rare instance of of of court just simply turning this over to scientists and saying you know how dangerous is this thing and it's also sort of amazing that\nWe've got this chemical that's out there that's being dumped into the water and we don't know\nHow dangerous it is until after the fact we going to take a quick break when we come back\n[noise] um and we will talk more\nAbout the double we know\nI'm Jim shooters

I Know and I'm sure you all are yeah and in a PS and um and so that caused a lot of hullabaloo because I think that was a big slap in the face to everybody like this is happening in our schools and we're not recognizing it exactly\nThat is exactly what it was and when you when you watch those new stories and you heard the description you think well my God how did that get by exactly but then you gotta realize well there's one teacher there's thirty to forty kids in that one room right a little bit stressed out you know and then also you know kids will do what they can to fit in\nRight absolutely well ah so because of that though a for a PS they did a mandated human trafficking training an address started the school year so that's good so even though I feel like um that's probably not enough here's the deal that step one so let let's take it and then we can just continue to go from there\nThat's awesome yeah OK it looks a little let's swing back by what well first of all I'm ... ... if there because you talk about you know becoming aware and Utah why should we be aware of as a community right should we be you know watching out\nWell we had I think I'm the more the more awareness that people are able to gather there are more able to identify which means they're more able to call things and it's got some stats from the ages office from um ... Seventeen so that is what they're what they're saying ah\nHappened as far as traveling from there and so this isn't a complete list because there's other you know factors but yet the age ease off if we can trust American kind of transfer yeah [laughter]\nSo for for them um they have they've come up with us for twenty Seventeen there were forty five human trafficking related arrests and there were twenty for law enforcement operations that were done to find victims and traffickers\nAnd there were a hundred and five confirmed cases of sex trafficking\nAnd then there were ten confirmed cases of labor trafficking what's that oh joke I work working yeah exactly and so even though those numbers don't seem like a huge\nUm here's here's what we know and kind of a note that they had\nPut in this report when they sent it out\nWas that all of these numbers were doubled from twenty sixteen oh my God and one year in one ear and they expect those numbers to double for twenty Eighteen at a big reason they're doing is we're not saying that there's necessarily more trafficking that's happening which there could be but really what it is is people are now able to um\nIdentify okay and then call in for resources which didn't happen before\nSo you you really feel I mean just like like bringing a top of mind like hey we we can no longer bury our heads in the sand right do you know this case that was up on the news not too long ago up in Santa Fe yet without ... without a tip without something like this that are developed at people watching\nIt really was and so when you look at when you look at this we've got we've had an clients come through our program um that were being trapped in a in an apartment\nAnd it was a nosy neighbor who was saying\nThat girl is in there by herself all the time and there's all these different men down my ... in and out and in and out they're not the same ones something's going on so it was that knows the neighbor for for this girl in particular who called it in and called the police and said hey so this is going on I don't know\nI bet it here locally that happened here locally that was here in Albuquerque\nOh my gosh so on and it's and that's not an isolated case now we do have a like with medical professionals are social services\nHave gone through more training they're able to start identifying kind of in those places so like in an emergency room say when somebody comes with some injuries they might be able to assess and then identify and send them for services okay we have that type of\nUm action happening now which never happened before and so again I think so much of it is if people understand that it\nReally is real yeah and um if there's something suspicious\nCall it is even human trafficking it could be domestic violence it could be something else call it in\nCollege or the investigation well I agree with you so much on that because here lately have we seen in the news and it's going to just you know kind of slipped my mind but as people like that doesn't seem right so they go ahead and call it in remain anonymous the people that are calling about aren't going to be able to find out it was right\nExactly you can absolutely be anonymous and I think you know I I think society has gotten so polarized that were just used to ignoring things and so we're apathetic about that\nAnd here's the deal to reject apathy it is time to say I am not going to be apathetic any more about my neighborhood about my community if I see something that looks bad I Need to tell someone\nIs is so weird like it's kind of like this I kinda like like what what kind of world are we living in where we we will post everything about ourselves and we'll sit there and scroll through and like this or an follow that but we won't pick up the phone and say hey there's something going on across the street right now it's kinda weird\nI it is yeah like the opposite of voyeurism kind of weird thing like here's everything about me and I'm feeling so bad today but yet there's somebody being a kid across the street and I'm not going to say anything\nAbout it it is if it's crazy and then even if you don't know that that's going on these kind of science I mean what are we looking for just as just as a shirt or just a regular person you know I I go to work I go home what are we looking for\nSo let me tell you kind of um like a typical pattern with um with human trafficking or kind of how how kids get involved and human trafficking specifically because again we're saying that most human trafficking victims end up um starting their trafficking\nExperience so to speak when when they're a teenager and so when you look for um kids that are already having trouble at home so for every victim that we've worked with a hundred percent they were all abused as children physically and or\nSexually so they were all abuse at some level as kids so this causes kind of some social differences from their their classmates families that are stressed tend to fall apart so you look at you start with a kid that's had\nThis history of broken is their family is starting to uh to come apart and so they start acting in um in ways that aren't like a normal kids so they are more likely to be rebellious they're more likely to make friends and do drugs are friends that do drugs and kind of going along this path\nSo then there's this really interesting thing that happens and they called the Romeo effect and so an older guy is able to identify that this kid is vulnerable to fit that enters exactly yeah absolutely predators and they hone in on it and they form a relationship\nWith that kid and that relationship is super strong so all those things that could never felt like they were beautiful or is that they were loved this Romeo comes in and he's you know the Knight in shining armor who's going to take care of them and they're going to go live together and have this beautiful white\nPicket fence life and the golden retriever and all these good things and so he works in developing that\nRelationship that is being\nDisintegrated within the family unit so they're not as close to their their their mom or dad or their grandma or whoever any of these safety measures well he starts isolating them so it's okay let's go watch the movies let's go get your nails done and so slowly he starts isolating them until this this girl decides that she's ready to run away\nAnd then he leaves and he takes her and that is when he's able to have her\nThan his own grass and turn them out to be becoming a trafficking victim and it gets to control exactly and this is something that's so ... so let me just tell you and for all of the listeners you know you walk into Wal Mart all the time and there's the missing and
