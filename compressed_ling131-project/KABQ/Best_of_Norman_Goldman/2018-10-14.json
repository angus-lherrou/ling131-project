{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Bar complaint now and even the fact that she was tied into the beginning of the\nAnd it and let me look at how many how many years ago it was a seven years ago you said ... yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it up\nWell you know I don't know\nIf you're going to make out of it yeah you're gonna make life miserable so ah if you want you you certainly can\nI don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to a bar investigation eased but obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a you know [laughter] it was representing their lawyers who represent lawyers in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I watch uh oh and I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people that took me sleepy\nEye and\nA relied on that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize\nIn this the first time out or when I was actually friday night and now I don't bother so it's your call here called do I think anything's gonna come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the white you were a notch\nUh being I you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily right there you are owed anyway yes\nHi I'm I'm\nA God I hate these winds All right let's try at a ...\nWe just lost you know there should be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send a guide to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right\nOh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris bill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to amend the tax return from Eighteen years ago it could get a refund of taxes paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that would have joined with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to file\nAn amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around either can't be found somewhere out there I remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your taxes or do you have an accounting\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere I could do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is under yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up now I go to Mike counting Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet and\nYou might have projected that I actually just buying it might go [noise] and ah maybe not just magically appear\nNow now I I Would I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that\nI don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nSeventy grand behind in car right that's another issue and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing\nOkay based on the child support order so\nI the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nAre cases in that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent ... doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or it doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code\nThese our phone books thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I Would have said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on February yeah All right so is there any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso\nLet me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity and of course another hack this was Facebook fifty million accounts oh of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already and it just doesn't exist so\nUh I've been a customer of life

Kelly joining us talking about how he was in ... had Hussein who is the man\nWho owns the prestige limousine service the limousine that was a legally on the road a number of his cars um had a failed inspection and yet this limousine carried\nA twenty people the driver and Seventeen friends between the ages I think twenty four and thirty four who are all going to a thirtieth birthday party\nTwo of the couples in the car had just gotten married\nI'm the driver of course killed two bystanders we're joined now by two other cats who can talk about the man who owns the service not exactly clear where he is right now his son has been arrested on manslaughter charges as a result of the accident\nHere in New York San braver mentor incessant attorney who represents in one of the new bore Newberg for who are convicted after she had a Shane led to a group an organized this game he'll tell us about that\nAnd in Los Angeles ... co director of the film terror\nThat's tea in parentheses and the word era camera a documentary that follows undercover FBI informant ... uh who I'm a college which just talking about another FBI informant um\nWe met you at the Sundance Film festival this astounding film a few years ago if you can finish um\nHow leaf a story for us how he figured out who shot had was a significant I mean he not only was involved in the jailing of men in Pittsburgh but also as we'll talk about with sand braver men the men in New York\nWho were then and trapped and are serving decades in prison at this point lyric\nYes so ... Hussein I'm In Pittsburgh and he was going by the name Mohammed\nUm and he had been assigned there presumably to investigate ... um but because of the new bird for case because that was such a publicly critique the example of entrapment\nUm during that trial shy had Hussein was photographed and was exposed um has photographed with placed ... actually it was the front cover of New York times\nAnd so because of all the publicly available information um in part due to stand braver men and other defense attorneys on the new bird for team um there was basically this publicly available information about ... Hussein\nIncluding recordings that he made of the new broke for that were entered I'm as government evidence during the trial in two thousand nine all of this was sort of public\nAnd so when Khalifa had his suspicions about Hussein\nUm side is saying in Pittsburgh under the named Mohammed gave Khalifa business card I'm with a number\nAnd Khalifa due to his suspicions he'd Google that phone number and it reference a number\nAnd one of the ... for a trial transcripts that was publicly available so ... through the Google Search was able to actually confirm on paper that I had Hussein was an informant\nI mean that is simply amazing this guy Gibson is number he's very nervous about him\nAny checks it out on Google and he sees it's the number of the FBI informant and the new forecasts which brings us to pray for men morning Hi it's great to have you with us on TALK about this case and Newburgh\nAnd yes it was front page news but I think for many people in this country it's long been forgotten about as they right away in jail\nOh absolutely true so the trial is essentially mock sued a that was his nickname in our case of course I don't think anybody could honestly say they know what his real name was because he ... he did so much immigration fraud on his original asylum application so I think anybody believes that he could be for it I mean nobody knows his real name\nBut beyond that he comes to Newberg his tests to go into Newark he goes into mosques and he specifically test\nKnew very very depressed that town of ...\nA very depressed that he was in ... falls before originally and you went into a mosque and people said get out of her\nGet out of here you went to the newer mosque and I'm On there said get out of here why why would they telling him to leave they were telling them to leave because he was in there to say let's have a hard let's have a holy war and the people in the mosque was saying well this has nothing to do with us we're here to pray we're here for a peaceful mission\nAnd so he kept getting thrown out of places and he found a disaffected person in a parking lot\nAnd that's how the Newark and his name was James prominent so James comedy was allowed my by his own absolute admission he shot off his mouth endlessly and then like ... he one day he said you know I don't have any interest in this matter more and hid for a month and a half\nHid the FBI knew exactly it was because they were trailing memory loss but every time the moxie would knock on his door he was hiding behind the door or he call of Egypt oh I'm Out of John I'm In Philly wherever I Am but the FBI was paying ... to do something he had a job like a salesman so as a salesman you only get paid if he makes the sale\nAnd he has to tell the person who wants to sell me tell you anything you want to hear so in our trial ... Hussein said things like I'll give you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a barber shop free cars free travel my client or look at it pay and was totally impoverished and my client was bought for food\nSo every meeting my client is eating that's how you got my client the joined us saying there's a\nFew feet somebody rice they're starving though believe everything you ask them to believe because they're starting to them as was my client ... so that that was the premise that got everybody into this once they were there saying just kept doing things his everyday task was to make the story better and the FBI was continually try to real him in\nAt the same time so there is a no no don't offer those things you can offer five thousand dollars so he went off the reservation said no to fifty is good\nAnd then he did these things have been to la to his handlers about it and they didn't know about it until they actually heard the tapes where he said two fifty asked I often do you two fifty you didn't want it out of the car\nSo it was endless and he said yeah I'm gonna fly on a plane my client said I Can't go anywhere I'll have a passport\nYou're talking about the the the most on educated the most on salvageable young men\nIsn't this target of this is ... very significant cause I'm shy head knows enough that\nHe cannot just be offering financial inducement she has that as he talks about the cause they have to be there for the cause right jihad not for the money because I don't get the FBI in trouble\nSo I Want to go to the HBO documentary the New Bern staying which features secret recordings the FBI native conversations between\nThe undercover FBI and former head Christine and James comedy uh one of the men who became part of the New Bern for you have to listen very closely because well obviously there's a surveillance audio it's hard to understand that clip begins which I had the same\nBoat as you unless downing bed you make a lot of money has to be on the side of one wrong [noise]\nThat'd be good but I have to know what I'm going to do to make the money\nI have a lot of ideas okay for you\n\nIn revenues by some brothers together story above the more you're going to be I'm hoping we can do it\nSo that is actually saying saying you're going to get some brothers together can change comedy and this is another clip from the secret FBI recordings nests one begins with James comedy\nNone of these brother's gotten jobs are only three of us without jobs but actually we should we humid and do all this money in our pockets or are you doing as many single\nHoney I don't either already they already knew Minnesota that's\nThe only thing they're going to make any money or whatever that these\n\n[noise]\nChild performed by ... says democracy now I mean he could and then within their means shape\nEnd today show with a remarkable new book titled how fascism walk the politics of us and them which focuses in particular on current trends under the Trump Administration arguing that the president is not as much of an anomaly in American history as we often think\nThe book's author Yale professor Jason Stanley whose parents were both Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S as refugees shows instead that quote in its own history the United states\nCan find a legacy of the best of liberal democracy as well as the ... the fashion aunt indeed Hitler was inspired by the confederacy and Jim Crow laws to family but\nHe also wants the danger of normalizing fascist politics saying quote what normalization dies it's transformed the morally extraordinary and to the board name it makes us able to tolerate what was once intolerable by making it seem as if this is the way things have always been\nWe're joined right now by Jason Stanley philosophy professor at Yale University his new book is just out it's titled how fascism works the politics of us and then his previous books how propaganda works welcome to democracy now professor\nIt's great to have you with us why now why are you releasing this book how fascism works now well\nWe have a global ultra nationalist far right movements crossing many countries both scenario and Brazil we've just seen and they feed off each other\nSo I think right now it's very important to make people aware of the features of fascism historical features and to alert people to the fact that the United states has always been vulnerable to this kind of politics\nWill explain what fascism defined what it means the is\nSo fascism is an ideology based on power liberal democracy is based on liberty and equality liberty and equality require troops because you need troops to speak truth to power\nAnd a free of if if your rely too you're not free no one thinks that people of North Korea are free they've been lied to\nSo if you're going to attack liberal democracy and replace it with power you need to slash truth so fascism is an ideology based on power and loyalty\nIt ah it it creates it's based on hyper nationalism so one group loyalty to one group and one person the leader represents that group it's hyper masculine and hyper patriarchal\nYou talk about the ten pillars of fascism what are they\nDepend colors or fascism our number one a mythic past of great mythic past which the leader harkens back number two propaganda to others certain kinds of a fashion a fascist propaganda aware everything has inverted the news as the fake news uh\nAnti corruption is corruption ah so ah so three uh anti intellectualism a as Steve Bannon said\nIt's a emotion rage gets people to the polls we got elected on lock her up and build the wall a Hitler and mine come says you want your propaganda to appeal to the most to the least educated people number four unreality you have to smash truth so a reasoned gets replaced by conspiracy theories\nI first started writing got out of my academic shell and twenty eleven when I wrote a piece about birth or it's\nBecause I saw a conspiracy theories coming not so deeply concerning talked to a sigh\nUnreality so you you you smash smash truth so all that remains as loyalty a higher ... uh in fascist politics the dominant group ah\nIs ah is is better than everyone else they were they were like the loyal to the great people in the past\nAh who deserve respect just for being that the victim\nAnd fascism the dominant group or the greatest victims the men are the greatest the victims of encroaching feminism\nA white so the greatest victims of blocks Germans or the greatest victims of Jews law and order what are the victims of the victims of the out group who are criminals what uh what kind of criminals are there the rapists sexual anxiety a pillar nine uh\nIs uh Saddam and Gomorrah the real values come from the heartland of the people in the city or decadent and pillar tennis all by multiply\nI'll work show make you free the out group is lazy they're not just criminals they're lazy and ... and social Darwinism it's all about winning so\nWell I Want to turn to one of the features of fascism and he liked Denis client this uh on reality a trunk or speaking earlier this year and he took aim at the media and did he has multiple times using a phrase that prompted comparison with George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen eighty four\nRemember what you're seeing and what you are reading is\nWhat's happening we have to make our country truly great again remember make America great again\nAnd then I don't want to hear this call\nFrom America great [noise] so that's Trump speaking a near the here and just to say that George Orwell's line read\nThe pine she told you to check the evidence of your eyes and and it was the final most essential command so can you talk about this particular feature of a fascism as you see it in the U.S and to Tom\nAnd you have Trump is very clear that\nAh that loyalty to him\nIs the only guy reality is of course the greatest threat to fascism because fascism is based on power and reality is a way of responding to power he said just false so you have to make everyone to destabilize knocked connected to the truth and you have to represent yourself\nAs reality and you have to show that you're stronger than reality 'cause fascism is about my ... and power\nYou are the son of Holocaust survivors how does that way and to you or scholarly work and what you're seeing now and whether you believe you can talk about the United states and this way right now\nWell uh I remember when my when I talked to my father about being the son of a Holocaust survivor and he read me James Baldwin's Nineteen sixty eight peace uh uh the negro negroes or anti Semitic because they're anti white\nAnd he said and one of the lines in it he uh he was a was you think you're more connected to us because our shared history of oppression were more angry at you because of our shared history of repression because we know you're glad not to be us so because of my background my mother worked in Manhattan criminal court for thirty three years\nI knew that the United states was replicating features of Nazi Germany and Eastern Europe with respect to its black population\nSo I was raised with an understanding of math math racialized mass incarceration I Lived through it I mean we're still living through it nine percent of the world's prison population as black America so I've been continuous percent of the world's prison population comes from that tiny group of thirty eight million people\nOr if the nation of black America by if if the nature of black America whether its own country it should be the third largest nation on earth\nAnd that's an emergency so we came in we belong had this fake news directed against our block population and it's completely on surprising that someone came and said hey you're used to fake news being directed against this population let's just generalize and directed against everyone\nSo what are the antecedent to Trump in America and you say there are the ... we have about thirty seconds\nSeasons to Trump our ah our while the KKK obviously the Nineteen thirties America be America First movement a is an added seemed to Trump he he references that ah and\nThroughout look the Nixon is that a thing to Trump he ran harsh law and order campaign in Nineteen sixty eight ought he slashed social spending to increase crime uh

local precinct and vote\nGood these are things that we're not hearing about in terms of young voters and I I'm skeptical just as much as anyone else in terms of the young voters turning up that bad in particular is good news\nYeah well I mean five you treated among other people you said there is an exodus of women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump and again yeah the matter how they try to keep spending this cabinet stuff and Trump's they go\nWomen loved in women are very angry about the Democrat hoax it's like yeah no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women all of a women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has seen his new generic ballot pool has women opting for democratic candidate sixty three to thirty three gender gap as a net\nThirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time about this blue wave is going to be female but I also say what you see every day don't get happy you know don't focus on any polls don't because there was one showing democratic enthusiasm way down after the Kavanaugh thing for a day and everybody freaked out right\nYeah well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality is is that we kinda are in that place where we have to scare our own people into voting yeah you know like I I literally we got to get a ... to go door to door just stare people\nVote out as just knock knock knock shout out shout okay\n[laughter] I look at the trick or treaters right\nYou won't even go just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door until they come down\nYou know scared enough to vote but I mean it's true but I think we're underestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now's the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted weed out of the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party yeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know Bob I think I'm\nLike I was saying it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced the Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keeps saying voting by mail once a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr own a lot of these voting machines broke hoops to oh well\nYeah and and you know as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans why I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of\nWe have not they have not invented the glasses yet but that can see a Jared Kushner's

[noise] a message from the U.S department of transportation and add [noise]\n\n[noise] Trump Saudis Dan panhandle shortages I'm Barbara coup that President Trump said\nThe United states will be punishing itself by holding military sales to Saudi Arabia he maintains that dance even if it is proven that a Washington Post contributor was killed inside the country's consulate in Istanbul Trump also said on Saturday to separating migrant families at the border could deter illegal immigration\nI just think we've never seen massage any like this and and you've been talking habits yeah\nMhm now we have an incredibly angry about that which I have but the bigger thing about that whole experience it's\nFrom day one and so and I said it on the air but confidant but the Democrats but her forward and quite frankly push throughout their against her well\nUm I I think by the way that whole circus federal privacy was for you know was brought to you by the Democrat and Republican and\nWhen he was pushed out there um and people running to their corners and getting uglier an ... year that we kept saying was factly what Donald Trump won and we gave him the exactly what you want and the media too and he won\nAnd as far as Brett Kavanaugh at her I really feel like\nIt's just lay trying the hearings and his opening statement yeah now his rage is in big man\nIs defending himself so a deeply personally taking it so far so late his rudeness and poker star his political angle that also does not fit the print for justice but it did not make him guilty\nWell okay well let's talk about let's talk about if a woman behave that way at a job interview\nYeah right I thought about whether what\nIf a woman behave that way at a job interview right well crying and screaming interrupting yeah\nI bet backup backup let's talk about what happened because not only what the Democrats\nOr to lay off base the way they brought this table and the Republicans were kind of unbelievably stereotypical um the media was horrible\nNo matter where you watched except for Fox he was being ... and hosts an anchor is considered this part of their bigger issue a bigger foods that for America has it's a much bigger than Brett Kavanaugh and they were literally convicting him on the air in all their energy gets to the analysts there was no pushback\nSo but I I guess that's a fascinating I gave Donald Trump a silver platter of the type of crap you like to get this country\nYeah the division I mean it's it's you know we're doing this division by sex now that he's done by race as well but you know ... I guess I Would I part company with you on that I don't I don't see how this is a Democrat hoax we had what forty people that wanted to talk to the FBI I mean that's quite a a a hoax if the Democrats orchestrated all of these people\nThat don't know I just think the way that the way that Dr Ford with rock on the American landscape and the way she was sort of pushed out there just\nIt really didn't it didn't feel right he was uncomfortable Dianne Feinstein come on let's let's do better on okay\nAll right well let's let's move on from that because then now we're now we're going to have a job and make a fight 'cause I don't I don't\nI don't think Diane Feinstein leaked it but let's you know you also went on to talk about this ... unbelievable photo op we have again where you know Brett Kavanaugh has already been sworn in and then you you you tweeted strange and grace list proceedings at the White House yesterday Democrats need to stay focused your anger is not enough to be better\nUm because once again for to proclaim him innocent\nWrapped an end to apologize to him on behalf of the American people and it just\nOh it was yeah yeah it was disgusting and it was so great was five was much much work it was sad but you know for\nI I don't think Democrats have anything to do but to look in the mirror and yet it members of the media is well that was that was brought by the media\nThe fell for all of this phone line and sinker and data to cover the story not to get personal you let them or the media telling their personal stories of being sexual assault and and that you know I Believe women and all that you know you can't do that are covering a story\nAnd did he or they don't see that is the question that we don't have the answer to not me too because I Will tell you that saying you're there were sexually assaulted and I stand with Dr Ford is convicting him you're a member of the media what happened\nAnd it it became about a movement and it became about politics and we got a laptop and quite frankly a lot of members of the media out at themselves they're supposed to be objective they weren't\nAs Trump got what he wanted you didn't like that trains in class was the way the other night it's been that made it happen\nNow well you know ...

started by crown prince Amman correspondence and kindly has more\nAnd my mother didn't want to believe me um but that sat me down with the other now adult party who immediately started crying and had had to admit it and then\nUm I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister\nAnd I didn't know that until I was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying when you hear these things or successive it's not just one victim it's many it's the the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue might continue to escalate they find new victims so when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ... or\nDo they fled and knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believe you but didn't yet believe that it was at a ... that it was the other members of my family look me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was even what Sam\nIf it was false spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white substance on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was you know as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that stuns me for the rest of my life\nAnd when I told my other family members they said well I Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe it's him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want anybody had her son that you're telling me because they can't handle that\nWell that's what this was so egregious people reacted so much to this Catherine that was just another layer of of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant [noise] so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the U.S\nAnd of course not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for\nThe Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him and his face is what five inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah he knows right at you and she knows all obviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first the date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean\nThe fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was ever nominated\nI mean it just I yeah I yeah I ... I couldn't\nWatch her whole speech I was like ... it's just a parent Lee there's a lot of women who've been raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that that is the dividing line all the men are innocent of that and\nIn this part she believes him about really he's port perjured himself how many times but she believes in about ...\nDo not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn roe over you are all the time\nThey aren't over turned off the tower there and listen to the standards that he put forward and his conversation with me and also I ... in the here and he says for president along a fabulous precedents like road to be overturned it would have to have been gravy is ...\nRon and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in answer the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not locals twenty twenty would obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed in Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but um\nI thought the upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\nWe\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard um you could present ski go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere is something that you're right about whether Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway or the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just eviscerated the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kinda like again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh with what you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just like sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr Ford did don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women you know you need to be responsible for their own\nBlah blah blah but\nIt's something I treated recently it's Ninety to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other yeah right there is no suddenly they're all mine and that's what they want you to believe so that means yeah if you're\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women right who are obviously credible and a half a cooperating witness was well they've been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report\nThat I think that the truth of it is that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said this that the white women are our first\nA barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and white man first degree of saying he's lying if not him that whole discuss things get Trump did\nYou know about the mother or grandmother mother I've been really mom mom what am I going to do like you know just before again as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash of of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's\nA yeah okay so uh Kellyanne Conway\nOh there are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again I go visit her speech justice Kavanaugh justice Cavanaugh I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes roe versus Wade if it is settled law\nPlease write he wouldn't be on this list if ... if he was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just is [noise]\nYou don't kill together is you don't like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get the oceans for their mistresses you know and it it it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses\nSpeak of is not going to and I think what people have to recognize as\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves it I said the system was working exactly as it was designed by white right conservative med\nIt worked perfectly they got Kavanaugh he will control women's bodies will control whether Trump has brought down or not he will do exactly what they wanted the system worked for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nThis is what the the rhetoric the always uses ... stuff like this going on Conway said\nTo be pro choice in two thousand eight cleaning that your first ...

what\nYou may not ... no longer be a Republican that seems to be the way you're pitching your books these days um but Jimmy your sense I mean was that the moment that ah when Susan Collins basically decided to re brand herself was at the moment that the party the Republican Party and Donald Trump\nSort of lost any daylight between them\nWell that's what I thought I mean I had you know we'd watch this whole thing unfold of course everybody was riveted to the story of you know the cabinet hearing than than the FBI investigation which\nYou pointed out was you know something of a sham and\nAnd I've got something else to say on that later a that have had to do with the further ramifications of that particular um you know an arrangement that was made between the White House and the Republican Senate and the FBI but as far as Collins is concerned I think\nYou know we we're all waiting there had been sort of dance that was going on with Jeff Flake and\nSusan Collins and Lisa Murkowski mansion and they were all speaking in corners and people were saying they were trading votes and making deals and what have you\nAnd this idea of the you know the quote never Trump or or maybe just call it you know the the independent moderates in the Republican Party\nThat they're still existed this sort of that last vestige of some kind of a conscience and in the past and Lindsey Graham would have been one of those guys or you know I'm John McCain or whatever Lindsey Graham turned into it you know of vicious poisonous reptile\nDuring this uh situation I mean he was out front and he was fully embrace thing\nTrump ism which has just vicious he was attacking you know rape survivors in the hallway saying you should have called a cop you know I mean he was horrible absolutely awful and so but you know that isn't coming for a while I don't think it was really surprising but seven cons particularly in the situation with\nIt being an issue about rape survivors and you know me too and women's rights which she was supposedly one of the last you know defenders and the Republican Party I think people worse you know still sort of expecting something from her [noise]\nUm and that speech that she gave highly anticipated we all knew it was going to be the deciding vote was basically a sort of a moderate version of a Trump speech and she fully went\nWith Trump which is that she that's why I put it that she Gasland the nation she portrayed Brett Kavanaugh\nCompletely the opposite of what he actually showed himself debate of the nation in that hearing that you and I talked about last time we were together here\nShe said he was a mild mannered thoughtful conscientious juror a jurist and in fact you know we saw what he was he was a threatening ...\nSchoolyard bully and she portrayed him as being the opposite of what we all had seen in other words she said you can believe me or you can believe your lying eyes\nAnd that is Trump that is the ultimate expression of Trump is on and for Susan Collins they put her out there she willingly in fact it seemed eagerly went out there said that\nThe protesters that had been a protesting at the Senate went along with the entire Republican line on that that they were all violent and it was an angry mob and you know and basically they were all women\nI shouldn't say oh and then there were plenty and then there too but it was led by women many of them rape survivors themselves who flew in to protest this and she's there Susan Collins a moderate protector of women's rights calling them an angry mob [noise]\nSo she had come I think that signaled I think the final last gasp of the Republican establishment\nThat might have at some point stood up and said no to Donald Trump I think it's over it's done Susan Collins is now just the other side of the coin of Trump is I'm she's a woman she's slightly less um crude in her delivery but the message was exactly the same\n[noise] All right well you know I I I I I agree and I think and and I want to ask you this and we're going to take a break your uh in in a moment but you know it occurs to me that\nI think this\nCalculation was was I mean Susan Collins made a conscious decision as to how she was going to brand herself in this era and if there was any chance a within the Republican Party\nFor there to be anyone other than someone who is like a a a sentence away from talking about pizza gate it strikes me and I I Want to\nPose this question to you will will have the answer it when we return\nAnd also I Want to talk to you about that what you think the implications of the non vetting of Brett Kavanaugh or will be in future or nominations but\nIt seems to me that with the death of John McCain a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins made the decision that there is no longer a caucus within the Republican caucus where they can a brand themselves as reasonable moderate and reach across\nThe aisle types of both and they made their decision to basically joined the herd don't

threat\nIs is to our loved constitutional guarantees a bill of rights joining me now to talk about this is Daniel Ellsberg a former U.S military analyst let me ask you about what's happening\nToday is in your opinion is Edward Snowden I mean you're a hero to our generation huge change you know you ended the Vietnam War without you would not have ended\nWhen it did you ... you know they're all of this history of the of governmental lies you change the way people felt about their government\nThey you know we know we grew up in a world where we couldn't believe that the United states government would lie to us and all of a sudden you know you showed that this is terrible Web history of\nOf lies at an end just that\nThe background for people don't know about this McNamara commissioned a report Mack Matt or who is always anti world though he escalated at McNamara commissioned the Pentagon and I think the RAND Corporation to\nDo a history of the war of how we had gotten into it to make sure it could never happen again and you are part of the team\nYou ever worked for Henry Kissinger you wear this brilliant Harvard kid who had and Vietnam or in the Marines as a warrior on came back from Vietnam and was a war hock at one point to an out\nYou were looking at it and saying this is not what it was supposed to be but you were part of that group at went through tens of thousands of documents and tries to how we had gone into it one of those copies\nWas in Iran corporations have you got pissed off one night because\nThe next administration had dropped a lawsuit against a group of special forces and CIA\nTeam who murdered a South Vietnamese informant and dumped a spot in the south China Sea and use it as it from a I'm going to give this to the New York times and you\nUse Iraq's ... on a twenty eight volumes are what ... what ... was and gave it to the New York times and that was the end and so you were you really Changed History and you're a hero\nDo you consider Edward Snowden or let's even brought to Jillian ... to be doing the same thing you are doing or is there a difference\nGreat similarities and the court says there are differences differences don't change my opinion at all\nThat Edward Snowden and before him Chelsea Manning and in a different role Julian Assange she was a publisher sort of in the role of the New York times\nRelative to the Pentagon papers he was not the shores but he was medium for this at a skill at considerable was comes so they are personal heroes your mind\nI think fair a trophy amounting and Edward Snowden are great Americans Julian Assange is not American which means he's not eligible to be a traitor but he was eligible to be called a traitor\nBy everyone just as interestingly Snowden is being called a traitor by\nYour ... trillion prime minister actually that's a sign as a whole makes Australia and for some reason a veil pronouncing and the foreign minister I pronounce you went Edward Snowden as a traitor which is ridiculous I have no more than a traitor than I Am and I'm not\nA definitely an Emmy account you gave of this which could which is right in in general outlines but incorrect to certain things for example I worked for Henry Kissinger after the Pentagon papers after I worked in the Pentagon papers in the in the ... on the street from\nA job I was certainly not a war hero I was a a a civilian in Vietnam and I did use my marine training from some years earlier as a\nRifle platoon leader and a rifle Corey commander or you've had experience to walk with troops without injuring them\nIn combat did see a fair amount of combat Troy sort of the war close up in Vietnam and then had a big influence on me and I did work on the Pentagon papers another little correction here\nUh the Pentagon papers you should wear to safer ground they were in my ... a very few people had top secret shaved in their office\nAt rammed they had to go to the top secret control office for that they had only secret files I had was one of the few with a top secret shave and that was in part\nBecause I had been authorized to study the Pentagon papers I was one of actually the only researcher along with the president of the company who had access to the papers at that time now that's very close analogy to\nShow them because what he gave was material he had access to\nAnd in effect authorized ... because she said for contractors at Booz Allen working for the NSA\nWhen fewer yeah and then you had the clearances which he had a and the authorized access to the systems\nThere were no rules so it was very little oversight for a man on at that point he was so free and he said anyone in his position could simply walk out the door for any reason uh uh with all that information and could have sold it\nFor a very great price to a very foreign powers which again a anymore than show the manning uh he did not do he gave it to the American people are without any recompense and at risk of his life from then on\nAnd I'll tell you really why I just heard him say in a in an interview with German TV I was watching it last night which I recommend to people whether we're stuck up Snowden and in Germany from television on Google News and you'll find it and he said I Will never be fully out of danger\nHe says unless these systems totally change which is frankly very far off and I think that's true for the same reason that President Nixon actually brought a dozen Cuban CIA assets from the bay of pigs\nTo incapacitate me on the steps of the capital on may third Nineteen Seventy two a year into my trial and a year away from the ending of my trial for them to that he brought people up the capacity to take me and that had really nothing to do with what I had already revealed and\nThere was somebody who was the Howard do you think that was that was what he\nHas a trivial afraid with him\nAnd there as they were afraid of me because she was afraid to me because of what they knew I knew that had not yet been revealed to maybe to shut up\nAnd I have to figure that we can earlier at the RAND Corporation as a consultant\nI wasn't really conscious at that time of corporate influence of the kind that Eisenhower had referred to the military industrial complex I didn't see that even when I go to policy was station has a Vietnam I didn't see it as a result of corporate introduction and to the state

with\nAnd I would presume that Obama could could tell us that could surely could find that out and put it out but he's I regret secret some\nSo we have the corporate influence there that is relatively open and that is true in Iran to really about the various influences but the oil over one it's always been a target but under surveillance matter ah it's really ... and I think who's done a lot to

[noise]\nWe're back on ring of fire on might happen tonia right now we're listening to a conversation that we had with the late Howard Zinn from the early days of ring of fire in his words there's important today if not more important\nThan they were when he spoke those words several years ago\nHow would you leave the story very very well about how this the hero in the savior\nIs just kind of one of those controlling mechanisms that controls the population when a against rebellion I mean you know if if you think about it a rebellion the has has has been pretty well suppressed by the American elite for a long time\nOr how how is how do you think\nOne percent of the nation owning about a third of the wealth in the country how has that they've been able to say well you know that's a good deal for everybody and it works for everybody have they been able to hold back rebellion in in in a situation like that\nYeah that question I asked many times you know what is special about the United states\nThat we've only had one revolution [laughter] way back I and\nI guess one there's several answers to that one\nIs that um because we have a semblance of democracy\nAs because we we have a semblance of representative government you know we have all the right institution as people vote and\nAnd and uh on paper you have checks and balances and you know on paper the the president can be thwarted by Congress or or ruled out of order by the Supreme Court to\nYou know we have all the paper reckless it's sort of democracy even though we don't have real democracy because he's institutions don't really work for the people\nBut the paper democracy is good enough so that\nUh that is persuasive enough so that people growing up and ... and going to school and saying all looking on a blackboard and say look look we have checks and balances\nAre so people are fooled into believing we have a democracy and therefore whatever happens happens at a democratic way I mean that's one reason why we have not had rebellion because we have political institutions\nThat that entice people into thinking they don't need that you I think the other answer is that this country is wealthy and uh so it can dispense enough good used to ... part of the population\nSo that you don't have you know eighty percent angry poor people you have thirty percent of people and then you have another sixty percent who are not really poor and who I just well off\nEnough to think that they are doing well in this system not where we have a kind of\nA fairly contented middle class which doesn't see revolution as necessary and therefore which accept the idea of a reality a of a small elites I'm taking most of the well for the country\nUh and and uh\nAnd the rest of the people sort of paying Kobe instead of small elite\n... talking with Howard Zinn A People's history of American empire\n... let me pick up with that with that very idea is it's interesting that you almost have with this class distinction has been I mean again you have one percent of the nation owning third of the well ... ... and that leaves about Ninety nine percent that really if you think about it\nIt's almost as if they're pitted against each other to fight for what's left exactly is that a stabilizing force\nWell it it has been a stabilizing force in the sense that it does make life stable for the people who are fighting one another and many of whom are left behind but it stabilizes the system because as you said it keeps it keeps people fighting against one another\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one is

there's still a lot of similarities between the election four years ago and the one that will decide in about a month\nThe U.S is still involved in more fiasco was in the middle east terrorist attacks are occurring overseas and foreign policy issues need to be on the minds of all Americans so let's listen to what ... Johnson warned us about before his death\nYou know ... it out of being the author Seventeen books it's hard to choose any one that ah without that I Would say is just ... probably my favorite ... is it somebody good stuff well it probably would be mine to really really that when I've been working on hardest\nWell it's just excellent so let me get right to the heart of it OK okay first of all if you were to describe why we may be or that empire it's on its way towards ruin you have a list of things that I think is yes it is just extremely interest I Want to go down the list and why don't you feel them in as we go okay All right\nYou're talking about the idea that we have a government did driving the nation to tyranny and ruin I mean that's that's the premise\nYeah and then you say these are the reasons why let's go down the list ... very compelling argument the chaff here first of all of the nation with no outside threats that prominently at war filled that in a little bit\nWell it is to say our commitment probably never formal rather earth wild but our commitment to him ... and militarism\nA puts us in to the effects of all empires sense of that of a of the Roman republic uh we uh\nWe face what are the greatest dilemmas Eddie ... history namely a domestic democracy and a foreign empire history tells us you can have one you can have the other but you can't have both\nI'll get the most secretive intrusive in repressive government in our history and a president who he describes a serial liar that all of our all of our listeners would agree with that in a little bit ... well I\nThink there's just no question that it it it's still hard to understand says we presume that George Bush is a is it American\nAnd was educated American schools and that he went to Yale University into Harvard law school at a few other things it doesn't seem to have ever heard the uh the least obvious elements in the constitution the separation of powers the fact that they are our\nMost important defense against purity and dictatorship\nOr that the this is a a a work of genius above all by a by age ... Madison or but by many others and that he has a bad ugly subverted ... with ideas that are there isn't a constitutional scholar in the country\nWho would agree with the possible exception of it apparently in saying lawyer sitting at the University of California Berkeley Law school freely James yo\nRight right right and and ... but this is the president would suggest that he's smarter than the frame or so so we know where that goes okay\nThis is the unprecedented wealth disparity that takes place where you have a corporate power\nThat has really in a sense created that disparity and you you in your book you just again every every one of these once you do such a great job renting them out of it but you talk about brand dies and he says this we we all know Supreme Court justice Brennan said that we can either have democracy in this country we can have a great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but\nWe can't have both how does it feel that in as far as your theory that we are driving ourselves towards ruined\nWell as a matter of just open the newspaper\nI mean the crises are on us every day we're the one of the few advanced democracies on earth that doesn't provide health care for all the population are any number of people including personal friends of mine a live without health insurance they simply decided that it doesn't fit into their uh\nTheir budget anymore uh the we have a a a fuel crisis that's a driving our economy into a\nPotential bankruptcy a standing behind all of this is not to say we don't have the money we do have the money but we're wasting it in the most profit possible way on foreign wars on military equipment\nThat we don't need that in fact we don't even think work we don't care whether it works or not most of this is being spent as a jobs program that the military industrial complex\nHas become a ... a intrinsic part of our economy these\nDay well I'm going to get to that and I want to talk about that but but I Want to stop with this when you talk about it in order as we drive ourselves towards this abysmal end you did you really do equate to a Ukraine equate to other civilizations roamed the Greeks are\nYeah it's a Soviet Union Japan I mean I could go on with that but it is ... ... ... but so so but one thing that you say as you say that\nIf you look at all of those failures that one thing that you had was the fact a one party state with two wings\nAnd I'm president claiming almost exclusive executive power where they ignore the rule of law you saw that playing itself out in other in other empires that had held\nNo question a now granted it's there's nothing determine ... about this or that or you can wake up and do the right thing the example I use in my book nemesis is the British Empire at the end of World War two it didn't do it well it did we stop the better there were many\n... throwback later but the British understood that you couldn't continue to use Nazi message holding together the British Empire\nNobody in Congress gets to see it yeah it you have to be a uniform military off a it's a\n... and that's thirty billion dollars a year right it's a it's that kind of thing that ultimately has caused the public to become a spectator\nOf a of the of Washington rather than a somebody that's a group of people that are directly involved and that have tremendous interest in and steak\nWhat goes on you as you add ... all sorts of your list you at ... there has to be this environment where you almost have a cesspool of corruption were him these incest was ties between cold American government and that they're really one becomes one in the same\nWell the military industrial complex has today so corrupted the Congress that Congress\nHas become the handmade and Congress have been in Congress women have become the surface of the Pentagon they'll do anything to produce a new military base in their district to produce a new contract or one of their companies um\nI live in the fifties district of California are representative until I just last year was Randy do cutting in Ocean City in federal prison\nLuckily for eight years or Rob a\nPSA lifting bribes in the military industrial complex I had written a piece of the Los Angeles times well before the district attorney and saying well you know after it on some of the uh on a saying that just on his filings with the federal election commission he was owned and paid for by uh the big defense contractors\nThe interesting thing to me as I got letters back from that that that article saying God I Wish you were my congressman\n[laughter] I could use a good job or you know that uh that's what we know America we make a yeah we make weapons we make pretty good weapons even if we don't make very good cars or a few others such thing\nYou know one thing that she did it almost ties in with that that last anecdote but she gave it up that\nThere is this dynamic that exists the dunes are empires and it's an unwilling to check on a willingness to change its ability chains you have an isolation is um you have this overstretched a military government\nAs a professor of international relations I'd have to say we teach that no empire ever voluntarily gave up yes uh but there are a few examples the British did after World War two I think that we'd have to say Gorbachev was doing everything is power\nAnd I said you know right who open friendly relations with ah France and Germany and to get rid of those crummy satellites that Stalin and built in Eastern Europe but he was stopped cold by vested\nInterests huge vested interest in the in the military as a way of life that's what we mean by most [noise]\nThat was the late ... Johnson author and historian and one of the greatest minds of the twenty twenty first century [noise]\nCome up author Frank ... is going to be here to explain how evangelical right has taken America Austin my seven Tony and we'll be right back with\n[noise]\n\nAmounts of money from the top of your home I'll find out they're going blind I have each one of my generation are both my mother and grandmother and my question I was going to be defined\nBy ... or sometimes for somebody are and how we are trying to find our way of ... printing money topic for free but first one on managing am aren't going to be around\nLike blindness dot org when I found so much helpful information called one eight hundred blindness today [noise]\nThey don't care\nAnd you know [noise]\n\nReally know [noise]\nI don't play that\n\nOh no\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nSearching for victims remembering the dead I'm Christopher cruise but death toll from hurricane Michael now stands at Eighteen a number of certain to rise as search and rescue teams and\nEmerged to say no no you know we're not fundamentalists although they didn't change the theology we are evangelicals and that's a nicer kinder gentler version of the same thing but it's still exclusionary and God love you but by the way if you don't accept Jesus he's going to burn you and how forever\nYou know what is it that way ever change right what happened in the division from a ... material I've read from you is that\nIt it's almost like the real extreme event evangelicals that they as you as you point out\nThey renamed themselves evangelicals right cause they for from standpoint as they were they were embarrassed by what was happening they want to disguise it but nevertheless they came away pouting they came away right the embattled in in this adversarial kind of a position where the rest of the world\nYeah and of course that's spilled over into the religious right that we were part of it in the seventies and eighties with the anti abortion movement and then that of course has the formative stage that then eventually\nFull speed ahead to Ted Cruz today and you've got the Tea Party movement saying listen we don't care what it does to the world economy or if it costs America twenty four billion dollars we're shutting down the government because we are bitter\nAgainst anybody who's not part of us and that's the saved in last paradigm that's the black and white paradigm you're either you know right with Jesus or you're going to hell and you apply that paradigm to American politics and you've got the kind of delusional stuff that I've been writing about in my new book and gods said Billy\nVery good stuff by the way thank you which is really an examination of this delusional quality of of American religion which essentially has not only cut it so far from fact based\nHistory and politics but now fast forward to our movement with Fox News and all the rest has an entirely alternative system of approved communication that doesn't even relate to fact\nOkay let let me ask you about let me ask you about that okay we come out of the shutdown war okay and everybody says okay who are these people right oh well the who are these people\nIn ... with the analysis of a purely secular analysis it is well there are people who simply don't want to pay more taxes there are people\nThey're anti government people right but there's more to that and that's what I read in what you're saying you're saying that if we really just still what is this new movement about\n... just like their recalcitrant about evolution their recalcitrant about global warming their recalcitrant about gay rights there are also recalcitrant about increasing the debt limit and that's the same group the this literal Bible group that we are talking about is that\nI remember where I came out of you know we had a lot to do\nWhat happens is there's a different kind of snapping and that is that when you have taken with your mother's milk that the world is your enemy that they are liars that Jesus is the son of God and if someone disagrees with you there find counter to all of reality that\nAnd I have one of the raid figures in that age my friend James Meredith who was the African American student who was admitted to old mess and I think originally I Know you said at one point you'd been inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural address\nJames Meredith was in the United States Air force from Nineteen fifty wanted Nineteen sixties any it tend to Jackson State university for two years and then decided to answer the\nSacred citadel of old mess which had been a white enclave since its founding the brown versus board of education case had been issued by the Supreme Court Nineteen fifty four [noise]\nAnd he was twice denied\nEntrance and then the U.S Supreme Court declared that old mess must admit him governor Ross Barnett who had actually supported President Kennedy and his Nineteen sixty\nCampaign became his adversary and President Kennedy's and my father's efforts to get James Meredith admitted to the state and there was a male a at that time that I and many people's view was\nHigh end of the last great battle of the civil war was over ten thousand United States troops was five hundred US marshals a hundred and sixty of them were injured\nAnd the riot as rednecks came in from ... new Avon from Birmingham and from Selma and from ... county and from as far away as California\nWith squirrels guidance and rocks and bricks and attack the life than building\nWhere the U.S marshals had gathered for a less than two people were killed\nIn the end James Meredith with the help of one of my father's closest friends John or answered the university and I think you you said in the past that you slapped very well that night\nRight you actually were in a dorm behind the life see I'm building and you went to sleep early well all the while the riot was going on is that is that right\nYes that that's true that's correct because you had done your job\nAbsolutely and that was to get the government of the United states to use the middle of a force of this nation to him for the rights privileges of all the black sure\nWe'll talk about your relationship to the Kennedy Justice Department\nWell I always considered the Justice Department at the president's brother your father Robert Kennedy and it was his decision and that decision I Believe he was to extend the\nCoverage of citizenship right everybody and I think he understood that and they carried it out for the first time it's just that to me\nHow the chief of the civil rights division at that time was my father's friend former Yale Law professor burqa Marshall and his other friend was a Republican whose name was John door had he\nFound those two sitting in the office on I think it was on a friday afternoon and he said to them I Want you to go down to Mississippi and make sure that James Meredith gets into the university\nAnd of course that's exactly what I mean you you know things I don't know but I certainly believe what you said this is what I the first time I actually talked to anybody ... your father and I was\n... years later when he was senator from New York and I was a student at Columbia Law school\nYou met John door when he was down in Mississippi with you a new ad burqa Marshall\nOh yes I I I particularly Britain much all I have no doubt about it in for a reason I wrote\nTo your father it's kind of general actually it was more to the Kennedy administration but the little one yeah and that was not that cause that\nAnd how did that happen exactly did you call the Justice Department first\nWell actually that was a young lawyer just graduated from ... but you can Mississippi to practice we have to agree\nWith the night and\nHe was really the one that brought the macho and to the pitcher and they are ready for me to an attorney general assistant have done much to have a conversation and and and ... asked me to send the\nLetter outline and what I was planning to do and I did that\nHow well do you remember ... were were you conscious that there was a battle being fought that night and that was there were thousands of people involved in it including the U.S military\nFrankly I Would have been laid off and not know\nWhat you knew that the military was coming but that night my other one\nI saw I mean not not in Mississippi but in Tennessee I Will stand Miller an air force base and I saw it coming in actually I saw on a macho and then you know getting them say I'll read\nOne was it like after that initial crisis pass what was it like going to classes and going to lunch and did you have a guard a US Marshal guard during your entire time at all mess\nEvery single day and they ate lunch with you\nKnow in the marshes did no wanderin' never did was a John Doe\nI add was their acceptance was there a gradual acceptance of your presence on the campus\nIs Fifteen Years later and still is no except at the University of Mississippi\nOkay we'll explain that to us 'cause this is the fiftieth anniversary well\nI ... I was not going to know more than ... Jew so I'm going to let other people speak to that my commitment to God [noise] so are\nYou told me that you know it doesn't hold off and the only thing that matters\nWhen when we decide to do that so a lot more I'm not trying to stick to that and deal with a ... a week or two I Will say this about Mr ... in terms\nOf the book and in terms of public education at the from the Pentagon three but I don't have\nAny through the ... very much work [noise]\nIn pointed well\nThen it was in Nineteen sixty two and my God I didn't have them\nNeed to go to break we'll be right back on ring of fire with

service means they are dedicated to delivering the best home improvement experience of your life\nWould be good for multiple people's less as a you know adopt an out and see what would fit I'm it's more specialized towards you know what what the ...\nWhat the veteran name and then so ah is it a case where the veteran is then introduced to a dog that has already trained or with a veteran and the dog kind of go to training together\nYeah it's pretty remarkable to see 'em so we have a selection process in which we introduce\nUm two three four dogs one at a time okay every veteran but it's it's kinda funny or veterans come in and they say I Want a German Shepherd I wanted you know but it's actually the dog that ends up picking the veteran and to see that happen um I get goose bumps just thinking about the selections that I've been a part of\nI Would love to hear some of the stories if you've got a chance to tell one or two of them out because I have always really do I I I've always believed that and even in my own life like when I was setting out to like say I wanted to adopt a dog I had in my mind a certain type of dog\nBut the but the truth is that uh all the animals that have come to me and my life literally I I Believe they chose me or or circumstances just happened that suddenly there's this dog you know then you know so I Would love to see how that one dog pick that human\nYeah I'm One of the selections that I was a part of 'em are veterans came in and uh you could tell she was really a nervous um and that's one of the things during selection process or trainers look at\nA not only what the dogs away but also the veterans and their non verbal so she had you know she was hunched over she was scared he can just tell she had a fruit brow um but then um it's the dog started to come in and especially when her dog came in you saw straighten up a little bit and um\nSo the connection and they were playing and talking um and our I'm director of programs um was talking to the veteran and saying you know asking are you feeling but the thing that blew me away as for the veteran is when um our director program said you know you're smiling\nAnd the veteran there's this huge pregnant pause and the veterans said you know you know I Am I Am smiling oh that's nice and no one should ever have to think about being happy working to and for us to make that connection and provides that\nI'm for somebody uh it just blew me away\nAnd uh have you been able to stay in touch with that that veteran and and that dog and how they're doing now\nYeah and the dog that was a the connection that was made there are a pit bull mix okay I'm In during the selection process everyone except the veteran ignores the dog so it's just the veterans the inter oh well just observed so the dogs running around slobbering on all of us I was like a big napkin for him [laughter]\nAnd um and two weeks later a when they came back in for a workshop\nI saw him and\nHe was right buyer um healing um of course she's standing up straight Oregon and smiling and um you can see that working already the gun in their path um or or the next nine months to a year for her to have a fully certified service dog\nUm and the change in you know two weeks was was evident\n[noise] do you guys have a plan in place or have you had to cross the bridge yet or where you may have to find a new service dog for somebody 'cause you know the animals they don't stay with us very long unfortunately so I is there a plan in place for stuff like that to happen\nYeah we do we actually have a successor program um for how\nYou know when we start in two thousand and ten is coming up to where the veterans that were part of our program in the beginning are going to need successor dogs so we actually have\nTwo or three veterans that have signed up recently\nTo um go through that program that one's a little bit shorter at six to nine months but it's still a lot of work\nStill a lot of work because you're you're taking a brand new dog right and of course you got a new person that has to I mean not a new person and have to learn at the new dog a little bit right there yeah and will uh will a service dog work right up until that I'm can no longer or will they get retired and say okay now you can just play and another service dot com than\nYeah no they retire they have time to be dogs okay yeah\nI can actually help the other ... successor dog they train them yeah\nSo boy I bet that's fun to see you know I haven't seen it yet but I'm I'm excited to process yeah yeah absolutely how long have you been with positive strikes me personally I'm\nMonths I was originally a training in turn and then I went through the enrollment and I was in Iran and turn and then I was lucky enough to be hired as ... as I was moving through the process but I really I like doing that I like seeing that outside of it\nYou know doing fundraisers for partisan sites and benefiting them in that way\nOh yeah and there Richard I are you are one of these guys that you kind of like I Know that we we met at a different organizations when you were working there and that that that happens a lot like a people that are\nJews this type of work where they're they're helping other people are so they they'll run from you know say at one kind of place and do one sort of thing for a while then they move into something else so what what moved you into helping positive stripes and soldiers and dogs\nI'm a myriad of things I I'm In our house we kind of a joke that we have two types of vets in our house um our family are that are veterans um my wife uh\nI both our fathers and grandfathers a veteran but my wife is a veterinarian and that that's a vet to says so um and so when I was actually through her a work I learned about pause and stripes\nI'm In the great work that they did I'm an opportunity came open and so when we sat down with me and said hey would you be interested in [laughter] and joining this group I'm\nAs the director of development and I said oh yeah absolutely um I've been blown away but what I've seen in an open with pose a threat to almost two years\nTwo years now yeah you know if it's a great organization I'm I'm so glad that a\nDeposit and stripes was was able to really could I get some traction going and I'm just stay in our community and help it
