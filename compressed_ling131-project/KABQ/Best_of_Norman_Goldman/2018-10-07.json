Trump or in two hundred thousand dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's companies beginning at the age of three\nWith the salary that increased to one million dollars a year after Trump graduated college and to five million dollars a year when Trump was in his forties over the years Trump has repeatedly portrayed himself as a self made billionaire who's only head start with a small loan of a million dollars he would say from his father\nIs stopping easy for me it is not that easy for me and you know I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had of been back within ... uses\nThat's the big leagues we don't know anything about that don't do it I said dad I got to go into Manhattan I got to build those big buildings\nI Believe what I built myself and I did it by working long hours and working hard and working smart more importantly than anything else just by using my own bread and there was a point where I was making so much so fast and it was so easy that I almost got bored and it's\nTrue I get a very very small loan from my father many years ago I built into a massive empire as I said my father back that law\nOn Wednesday President Trump attacked the New York times he tweeted quote\nThe failing New York times did something I've never seen done before they use the concept of\nQuote kind value of money and doing a very old boring and often told ... piece on me added up this means that Ninety seven percent of the stories on me on bad never recovered from that election

personal tax returns which has refused to release White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the article during Wednesday's press briefing\nI'm not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring fourteen thousand word storage the only thing I Will say one thing the article did get right was it showed that the president's father actually had\nThat's a great reporter Wayne ... dog at President Trump Donald Trump who long before he wished precedent for decades and of course right above about and I'm white and ... and I went to his house to interview him just before he died\nDavid Barstow your three times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist out mine of course one of your colleagues over the decades you say ten in your piece\nOn he's giving us some sense ... like go back to the beginning um and talked\nBaby ... baby Donald Trump and how he started to recruit as well something very different than he is told\nYeah so how does a three year old end up making two hundred thousand dollars a year right that's a good question um here's how it worked um ...\nYou know she ... she ran is absolutely right that she was\nUm a really great builder in the outer boroughs um\nBut much of his building was actually made possible\nThrough federal housing subsidies he was actually one of the country's biggest recipients of cheap building loans basically made possible by the federal government and he used I'm twenty six million dollars or so\nOf those cheap loans to build two of his biggest um apartment complexes in New York I'm a place called BJ than another place called shore have in both out in Brooklyn\nUm these are massive massive apartment complexes thousands and thousands of units and and so he's building those in the late forties and what he did was something quite clever he she he um he put the land underneath the buildings\nInto a trust and made his children the beneficiaries of that trust and then he had the company's his companies that were actually building the buildings on top of the land\nSigned Ninety nine year leases to pay rent to the landlords\nHis young children\nAnd so what that meant was that Donald Trump starting at age three was for Trump's landlord\nHe was collecting rent payments um from Fred Trump's uh companies and it was um this kind of maneuver right setting up the sort of mechanisms these financial mechanisms that were just\nKind of create this automatic streams of money that we're just sort of month by month by month with trickled into trust accounts or into partnerships and find their way ultimately into\nThe pockets of his children for Trump was just a genius at coming up with new ways new revenue streams to funnel into the pockets of his children so he didn't just make his children um his landlord she also made his children his banker\nHumid Donald Trump not just didn't just put them on the salary as a vice president and Fred Trump's\nCompanies he also then paid him separately to be as consultant\nWho pays him separately to be a property manager you play them pay them separately to be a purchasing agent and on and on and on it went in in the course of all all of us as we gather up all of this the the records from inside of his\nUh for Trump's real estate empire we started counting up how many how many different revenue stream says he created for Donald Trump through the years\nAnd we got up to two hundred and Ninety five what we found and what we were able to document\nSome of these things you know they weren't in and of themselves big money like for example for Trump funnel the laundry revenue from his buildings to um to to Donald for so a lot of money but when you sort of start aggregating it putting it all together\nIt's this just this mighty endless river of money flowing constantly into the bank accounts of Donald Trump\nI mean one of the things that you do in your piece if you give a vein and strong fan of the extent to which Trump seemed to have a special relationship with Donald Trump can you explain that so much of the money I accrued to Donald Trump again uh\nOther children still you know what did you learn about why that would be the case and also that the principal illegality I mean what you spoke of a beach have an insurer have and the responsibility for that is a ...\nAnd is it actually technically illegal when he did\nSo in that transaction there's nothing illegal about that transaction that we've uncovered that's not what I'm that's not the point that I'm trying to make their that's an example though of one of the many different ways that Fred Trump was enriching Donald Trump starting from a very early age and continuing on up for it\nUm your your your um I'm Sorry the other point\nAbout the relationship between fat on al ... why did he get on my own money\nSo he said Trump had 'em in a an older son\nFor Trump junior who um initially it was kind of going to be the heir apparent right in ... I was interested in you know she she she really wanted\nTo pass this dynasty on to um to uh to one of his children and Fred junior was sort of the first\nKind of natural heir apparent as the oldest son but um he didn't have the passion for the business um he had other interests he liked to fly airplanes he loved music\nHe he he ... the father considered Fred Trump the son\nTo be a little too soft\nI'm a little too nice um and before long um it became clear that she was not going to be the Arab parent\nThe heir apparent was going to be Donald Trump and Donald Trump was very aware of his father's disapproval of Fred junior he witnessed the spread could senior\nCould be quite cruel and I think what we see in terms of this has really from interviews with people who work closely with Fred Trump you could they witnessed\nThis young man Donald Trump sort of watching what had happened to Fred junior and almost forming himself into for juniors opposite Fred junior was soft too nice will Donald was going to be a shark he was going to be a killer\nSo that that I think is sort of at the core of this father son relationship which is very much with the story is about it is about a father son relationship these two men were extraordinarily close Donald Trump said we we quote him that he felt that he knew his\nFather better than anybody else in the world I'm In and they they they talk daily they spent\nYou know many a weekend together they were in constant communication Donald Trump was a constant presence when Fred Trump would have strategy sessions with his his top lawyers his top accountants I'm figuring out what his next moves were\nA Fred Trump was often this sort of silent lurking presidents at Donald Trump's big flashy press conferences and so they were this there was a it was more than just a father son relationship it was also a partnership\nAnd it's interesting you talked about the amount of federal grants that he got that Frank Trump got an interesting not just say Donald Trump came into the business and they were simply because they're getting federal support and they're discriminating ants African Americans\nBut I wanted to go back to read from your point David vice down he\nWrites unless overt fraud West Palm Beach County building supplying ... company formed by the Trump family in Nineteen Ninety two all counties a sense of purpose was to be purchasing agent for ... buying everything from ... to cleaning supplies\nNo such thing recognition interview shell and set off county safe and millions of dollars trying Frank Trump's empire by simply marking purchases already made by his employees\nThere is nearly as effectively ... cents load all counties down your Donald Trump siblings and a cat and fried shrimp than Unifi padded\nAll county receipts to justify think Iran increases for thousands of tennis game\nYeah um I mean this is something where [laughter]\nI'm when Donald Trump says this is old news I can tell you that\nThat no one has ever heard of all county building supplying maintenance it's never been written about described anywhere\nUm and this is actually a kind of a remarkable in a way it's as it were we were when we were peeling back the layers on this it's salt\nIs like one of these sort of gritty scams that you might see in the Sopranos right it is\nIt's setting up this company to make um basically huge cash gifts from ... to his children look like a legitimate business transactions let me give you a just a really simple examples is one that we describe and we actually show in the story the actual invoices and purchase order so you can also see for yourself\nExactly what I'm Talking about so they set up this company all county building supply in may and it's not a real company there's no corporate offices it's actually headquartered in the basement\nOf Fred Trump's ... a favorite nephew um ah the owners of all county building supply though were for Trump's for children and his nephew and off all that happened was so Fred anytime Fred Trump was going to improve his buildings\nUm [noise] brownish orange which\nI think um I think that that clearly the such limitations is a big obstacle to any kind of a a criminal charges however um you know we actually don't know what ended up in Donald Trump's tax returns and so if there are things that she misreported\nUm that have their roots and some of the transactions that were describing in this article and those miss representations carry forward into future tax returns um from from down from that could be potentially problematic because that could maybe\nI'm a take such limitations off the table as an obstacle\nI'm there could be a criminal\nOr a prosecution\nPotentially although like look you know let's be real here I mean the IRS is a much weekend is in the I mean it's been quite devastated\nBy um budget cuts over over the years um and um and certainly the the IRS I'm Talking about a buck talking about state authorities now talking about the federal Ira has said absolutely nothing in response to this article um I think the more the more I'm\nA little more realistic uh accountability that's there is this potential for civil um fraud\nUm there's no statute of limitations for civil tax fraud um and so both this year on this because the state tax authorities that can be a very powerful weapon um if they decide to actually use it um to go back and look at these um uh transactions\nWell let's go to um some of the mechanism that you point to a ... in the piece that Trump or and used in order to avoid paying taxes explain what Gratz side G. R. A. I. G. S.\nS. and how they were and how they were used in this video accompany the New York times extra day you are co authors do than crack explains how Trump and his siblings came to own nearly all of that father a fact Trump empire\nWithout paying at state taxes\nGraft trust is\nMind past wealth between generations\nIn Nineteen Ninety five Donald Trump and his siblings began to take ownership of most of their father's real estate empire while avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes [noise] they did so by creating to ... retained ... also known as ... one for died in one from um [noise]\nTaxes are paid based on the final value of the grass and escape the Trump every incentive to low ball the value of the ... that's exactly what they did\nTake for instance the ... apartments in Nineteen eighty to the Trump value the hundred and sixty four unit complex at Fifteen point three million dollars but for the purposes of the ... they said it was worth of just two point nine million dollars\nThey'd been broke up the ownership of the apartments giving almost half married Trump Fred Trump's wife [noise]\nThis allowed them to tell the IRS Fred Trump who would exercise iron fist control over every breath of his empire for Seventy years was a minority owner with no real say over his buildings\nDavid that you are co authors design crank talking about ground could you comment on whether this instrument is what essentially gave legal cover on to a ... action\nYou know I mean sort of Gratz are um you know a well established and legal instrument that's used by the wealthy 'em to pass um assets onto their children in a way that allows them to avoid a state taxes in fact\nUm if you watch TV often see these commercials from video um that are actually ... commercials they don't say the word grab\nBut when you see this video video is this tax consider this consulting firm I'm I'm that is that is actually on CNBC MSNBC and CNN is running commercials that are effectively commercials for graphs\nI'm a I'm and I'm In so it's a it's a it's a um it's a technique that when you talk to tax lawyers\nYou know the kind of they have this they almost got a little misty eyed about Gratz this and this is like magic\nThese things are these incredible devices that assets go in all kinds of financial gymnastics occur inside of them and then they sort of assets come out and they're like free of taxes\nI Want it to go to another of your former colleagues and that is David Cay Johnston also fellow Pulitzer Prize winner and now editor in chief that they seem apartheid arcane noted MSNBC that Trump sister who is a federal judge has heavily implicated in these charges of tax fraud\nLet's keep in mind Donald sister Mary Ann Trump Barry is a sitting judge on the third circuit court of appeals she's a senior judge I treated today though I think she should immediately removed herself from the bench we should not have a tax cheat in the White House or on the federal bench\nWhat do you think of that sets David Cay Johnston\nSo I'm a I think the important thing to to say about this is that\nFor Trump's estate tax return it was a very important document\nUm and there were three executives there were three people who signed off on that the state tax return one was judge Barry one was President Trump and the third was Robert Trump the president's younger brother\nWhen you sign an estate tax return\nYou're responsible for the accuracy of that tax return you're responsible for accurately describing the assets and you're also responsible for describing all of the gifts that were given by the person the person in the state so\nWhat we describe in our story is that the estate tax return that the three of them signed up to three of them vouch for that tax return is grossly inaccurate news all of the same kind of techniques that we describe in other parts of the story\nAnd it did so in order to make what was left to Fred Trump's empire look like\nMiniscule um and so I think that actually that the fact that she put her John Hancock on that I'm a state tax return um I think that's an area that is is potentially problematic\nWhat most surprised you and what you found David as we begin [laughter]\nAnd the thing\nThat I think continues to surprise me about Donald Trump is that this is this guy who has been so much in the ... of our culture and our media for so long and yet\nThere's so little that we actually know about him and his finances you know ... there's this mountain right mountain of books and and interviews and you know it's just it's it's daunting 'em to look at but when you kind of put all of that side aside\nAnd just trying to get to ground truths with this guy it's\nIt's every time we have done that we've been we feel like oh my gosh the idea of whatever the idea was that we saw with that um about him is it's quite different when you pull some more layers back\nAfter French on staff you write his empires most valuable asset west and I are you from Donald Trump and he said he trained his father and what he wanted with his empire\nDifferent Trump really wanted the empire to say in the family Donald Trump was in some financial difficulties difficulty again in two thousand and four and he was the one\nWho came into a family meeting and so it's time to sell dads buildings and so they did and the irony is\nThe price that they got for all those buildings was actually hundreds of millions of dollars less than what the actual property was worth according to banking records that we have uncovered\nDo you think this well for ... somehow lead to seeing Donald Trump's tax returns ... and the political um blowback from it\nYou know it's hard to to say depends so much on who's actually in control of the subpoenas in Congress I'm On the basis of what happens in the mid term elections that they cut to paint it I'm\nSure absolutely and I was there an accredited came to power and every Democrat I mean every\nYou know there's a long line of Democrats who have said this story is all the more reason to exercise that subpoena power should they should they win the up\nAnd you're just coming out again and find day\nIt is as a special section\nDavid by three time Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter for New York times lead author on the new New York times ... tax schemes that she read riches from his father\nUm we were linked to that many paychecks by say that that's it for our show happy birthday to Pakistan Leon ... raised by my friend's house and having Carl wells aren't gotta

now we were another girlfriend and I were talking about they're\nAll boys are not first of all like one of my our listeners wrote and said I have two sons we raise them to be protectors of women not predators right that if you see a girl that struck make sure she gets home okay but anyway a couple of my guy friends talking to them this weekend\nThere were such good guys one of them got an email from a um or a Facebook message someone galley went to college was hadn't heard from in you know whatever thirty five years that I've always wanted to write to you\nAnd the ... and thank you and obviously this was triggering a lot of people everything that happened\nAnd um she just remember night very deadly where she had way too much to drink passed out and my friend got her home and took her shoes off and go to bed and whatever she just said I wanted and so my friend and I were saying we should start a thank you movement in addition to me too yeah\nLike thank you to the good guys you

the real world there is no spokesperson to prevent reckless driving there's only you\nSpeak up I Know there are a medic voted standing by\nThis has been a message from the council for more information go to us the spokesperson dot com\n[noise]\nFour vacancies sailed tromp on the attack I barbecue that\nFollowing intense debate Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and then sworn in as the one hundred and fourteen justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nWhat we find is that in each case the extinctions were caused by the crust of the earth being either penetrated her cracking open and in the process releasing enough greenhouse gases to produce radical greenhouse gas\nDriven global warming which render the the the planet\nIn hospitals in hospitable for the currently exist in species so most of them died off in the few that could adapt to the new uh temperature normal became the the you know the next ... you know that the dinosaurs died off into mammals came along because mammals were warm blooded and they could deal with\nWith uh you know the new temperatures post Katie so\nI'm ... when when\nThey ... up until the Nineteen sixties really nobody knew what any of these extinctions were caused any of them um there was this theory that they had all been caused by media writes hitting the earth and puncture in the earth's crust and then that would you know lead enough of these gases ... escape from from the earth but it would produce this global warming that would kill things off\nUm they they nailed down in the media right theory for the Katie extinction one sixty five million years ago it was apparently a meteorite that hit the earth around there were Kan coon is where the ... that basically made the Gulf of Mexico and\nAnd ah you know that punched and a big enough hole in the earth that enough carbon containing and and other greenhouse gases were release but\nIt wasn't really until\nAround two thousand two thousand two that they nailed down will cause the permanent\nWorst of all of them and they had always assumed it was a media right it turns out it wasn't it was it was it is happening during a time when when the earth had only one continent on it and this that Khan and started moving and splitting into two and all these other process but it's actually preceded that\nIt it kind of a pre stage that there was this huge volcanic corruption went on for thousands of years call in an area and that we now call Siberia the regents called the Siberian Traps\nAnd over a period of time this whole can of corruption produced enough greenhouse gases that had raised the temperature of the earth I'm ultimately you know when the whole thing was all done by\nProbably somewhere between twenty and thirty degrees Celsius which just you know wiped out everything\nNow is when we talk about um um the the inability of species to adapt is it simply a function of a change in temperature or temperature or is it a function of what the change in temper temperature does to the the access to things like food and ready to do that or\nA a it's very much the ladder um being a bio systems ecosystems change and and and you know a plants animals and sometimes the microorganisms that support them for example trees exist because there's fungi on their routes and bacteria and the ... the transport nutrients into them\nAnd in some cases climate change it makes makes those bacteria and fungi network as well and so the trees can't transport the nutrients that they need and you end up with fragile trees that are vulnerable to things like rust and as the Beatles and and the fungus is and things\nUm so so that's the process the the the the two really important points that we try to make in the first movie our number one\nThere are tipping points and when you hit those tipping points into a mass extinction\nUm you'd typically don't know that you past the tipping point until you're already passed it and number two that the that the\nMajor tipping point is the release of of methane gas that his frozen in ice flurries around the coasts of the continents and in the Arctic region and in the Arctic permafrost and and and number three really\nIf you think of the first five extinctions four of them were caused by massive volcanic activity one was caused by a media right\nPunching a hole that was functionally the same thing as massive volcanic activity in each case the core the the the the crust of the earth was breached what we have been doing for a hundred and fifty years now\nIs the same thing we have been breaching the crust of the earth we'd been drilling holes into the earth only instead of doing it like with a big thick hammer that just goes ... you know with the media right for example hitting Cancun or the Siberian Traps going out for a thousand years\nInstead of doing that in that blunt force way where you know you're hitting some areas that are carbon rich in some areas that are carbon poorer and you get all kinds of other stuff going on you know volcanic rock and stuff\nInstead of doing that well we've been doing as searching the planet for the carbon rich areas and then drilling specifically into them or mining specifically into them extracting the carbon containing compounds\nNatural gas coal and oil and then burning those and and and throwing the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so we have altered the planet's atmosphere\nBy punching holes in the crust and pulling out these these ancient stories of carbon\nThe same way functionally I mean the mechanism has been different but the the end result\nCould be the same as in the ... as in these previous five mass extinctions and there's\nA yeah we have burned three hundred and fifty billion tons of carbon we burn it and thrown into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution roughly Eighteen fifty\nThree hundred and fifty billion times and that is produced a one degree temperature increase which means that there's another degree that's pretty much unstoppable there's always whatever you've done there's that much in the pipeline before it exhaust itself\nSo that three hundred fifty billion tons of is producing at a two degrees Celsius temperature increase or all of them will\n[noise] in the just in the Arctic just in the Arctic there's\nSomewhere between one and two trillion tons of carbon in the form of methane largely in the Arctic permafrost and in these methane hydrate these methane snow cone\nSlush is uh just under the ice in on the on the surface of the the ... the surface of the Arctic Ocean\nAnd that's basically functioning like a like a loaded gun uh and and and we've got to take a break when we come back\nLet's talk about the ... the the rate of methane gas release and a greenhouse gases\nIn the um the last five great extinctions and where we are relative to that in in in this [noise] this ah it's it's it's a little clinical to call it a process but would that were involved and we got to take a break we'll be right back with Tom Hartmann when we return [noise] and [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] this audio is for your review for broadcast distribution of other

don't know about this McNamara commissioned a report magma or who is always anti world though he escalated McNamara commissioned the Pentagon and I think the RAND Corporation to\nDo a history of the war of how we had gotten into it to make sure it could never happen again and you were part of the team\nYou at work ran re Kissinger you were this brilliant Harvard kid who had in Vietnam it in the Marines was a warrior on came back from Vietnam and was war hock at one point it out\nYou were looking at it and saying this is not what it was supposed to be but you were part of that group at went

I don't know twenty eight volumes are what ... was and gave it to the New York times and now is the end and so you were you really Changed History and you're a hero\nDo you consider Edward Snowden or let's even broadening Julian Assange to be doing the same thing you are doing or is there a difference\nGreat similarities and the court shows there are differences differences don't change my opinion at all\nThat Edward Snowden and before him Chelsea Manning and in a different rule Julian ... she was a publisher sort of the New York times\nRelative to the Pentagon papers she was not the shores but he was medium for this country was to show they are personal heroes your mind\nStreet fair a trophy amounting and Edward Snowden a great Americans Julian Assange is not American which means you're not eligible to be a traitor but he was able to be called a traitor\nBy everyone just as interestingly noted is called a traitor by the Australian prime minister actually a that's a ... a whole makes Australia\nAnd for some reason a veil pronouncing and the foreign minister I pronounce your dad would show them as a traitor which is ridiculous I have no more at trader than I Am and I'm not\nA definitely an Emmy account you gave of this which could which is right\nAnd general outlines but ah incorrect to certain things for example I worked for Henry Kissinger after the Pentagon papers after I worked in the Pentagon papers in the in the ... in the street from\nA child I was certainly not a war hero I was a a a civilian in Vietnam and I did used my marine training from some years earlier as a\nRifle platoon leader and rifle company commander or you've had experience to walk with troops without injuring them\nIn combat and did see a fair amount of combat Troy sort of the war close up\nIf you had not had a big influence on me and I did work on the Pentagon papers another little correction here are the Pentagon papers you said we're in a safer ground pay rent mice have a very few people had top secret shaved in their office\nI add rammed they had to go to the top secret control officer that they had only secret files a I had was one of the few with a top secret shave and that was in part\nBecause I had been authorized to study the Pentagon papers I was one of actually the only researcher along with the president of the company who had access to the papers at that time now that's a very close analogy to\nShow them because uh what he gave wish of material that he had access to\nAnd in effect authorized ... because she said for contractors at Booz Allen working for the NSA\nOnce you are yeah and then you had the clearances which he had a and the authorized access to the systems\nThere were no rules so it was very little oversight from then on at that point he was so free and he said anyone in his position could have simply walked out the door for any reason\nUh uh with all that information and could have sold it for a very great price to a very foreign powers which again I anymore than show the manning uh he did not do he gave it to the American people are without any recompense and at\nRisk of his life from then on\nAnd I'll tell you really why I just heard him say in a in an interview with German TV I was watching it last night which I recommend to people by the way to look up Snowden and in Germany from television on Google News and you'll find it and he said I Will never be fully out of danger\nHe says unless the systems totally change which is frankly very far off and I think that's true for the same reason that President Nixon actually brought a dozen Cuban CIA assets from the bay of pigs\nTo incapacitate me on the steps of the capital on may third Nineteen Seventy two a year into my trial and a year away from the ending of my trial

on me on trial it will never be enough for them to put ... on trial and let him out on bail if he came back to this country I Do not believe it or if you will be given a moment\nFreedom he would be in ... in isolation like Chelsea Manning\nUh from the moment he arrived her nobody was captured or they kidnapped him\nAnd he never get out\nAnd could very well simply be killed they either kept in isolation or killed cause\nFirst of all there's a lot that hasn't come out yet that he has given to the newspapers but beyond that\nHe's made it clear that he chose what he gave to the newspapers is what he thought the public needed to know or what should be public\nAnyhow held back and did not give to the newspapers or copy or bring him a tremendous amount of material that he felt would not true Republican trips to be put out to him to get them to sort of ugly secret but uh they would never trust is\nJust ahead on ring of fire well here in energy from the great ...

the U.S Supreme Court as he took the oath of office last night protesters chatted outside the court building\nTrickle down there that has become a you're in the capital and being a confirmed today what is being sworn in right now those very bring or there are\nAnd you start off really by by painting the picture of how dangerous it is for the American public or really any any nationality to rely too much on this hero worship in on saviors that we were always looking for that said you talk about that a little bit let's begin the discussion there\nYeah a saviors it's very interesting 'cause we consider ourselves a democratic country and we think of totalitarian countries and dictatorships at places where there's some big father figure you know\nIs whether it's style in or or you know a ... some buddy I'm In this totalitarian country that you know you\nYou defer to ... and here we are a democratic country and and yet we have grown up in a culture in which we have taught to revere or the founding fathers\nAnd we're taught to review the military heroes and our history has told through the president's you know the age of Jackson the age of Lincoln the age of Roosevelt you know\nOf the and uh it's it's ironic in a democracy you're not supposed to revere and have too much respect for the people who are running the country are you supposed to be active and engaged critical citizens\nSo so in in people's history and and again in in his\nPeople's history of American empire well there are heroes but there's a ... not the usual heroes that is that you don't find the theater Roosevelt warmonger as a hero you don't find theater Roosevelt man who thinks you know war is the highest quality that human being\nCould have we learned in high school right [laughter] yeah\nBut we we have Mark Twain as a hero because Mark Twain spoke out against Theodore Roosevelt and denounced him for his Roosevelt had praised a military a massacre in the Philippines so yeah we have we ...\nWe have heroes but they're very different and [noise] and they represent the [noise]\nYou know what people need and and they don't represent the establishment\nTo take a quick break but we'll get back to our discussion with linked Howard Zinn when we return\nIf you want even more ring of fire then you can visit his online a ring of fire radio dot com or follow us on Twitter ring of fire radio I might have been tonia we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nHistory [noise]\nHey this is Sam seat or you're listening to the best of ring of fire radio [noise]\nBack on ring of fire on might happen tonia right now we're listening to a conversation that we had with the late Howard Zinn from the early days of ring of fire\nIn his words are important today if not more important than they were when he spoke those words several years ago\nHow would you leave the story very very well about how this the hero in the savior\nIs just kind of one of those controlling mechanisms that controls the population when a against rebellion I mean you know if you think about it a rebellion has has has been pretty well suppressed by the American elite for a long time\nOr how how is how do you think\nOne percent of the nation owning about a third of the wealth in the country how has that they've been able to just say well you know that's a good deal for everybody and it works for everybody have they been able to hold back rebellion in in in a situation like that\nYeah that question I asked many times you know what is special about the United states that we've only had one revolution [laughter]\nWay back I and\nI guess one there's several answers to that one is that um because we have a semblance of democracy\nAs because we we have a semblance of representative government you know we have all the right institution as people vote and and and uh on paper you have checks and balances and you know on paper the the president can be thwarted by Congress or or ruled out of order by the Supreme Court to\nYou know we have all the paper reckless it's sort of democracy even though we don't have real democracy because he's institutions don't really work for the people but the paper democracy is good enough so that\nUh that is persuasive enough so that people growing up and ... and going to school and saying all looking on a blackboard and say let's look we have checks and balances\nAre so people are fooled into believing we have a democracy and therefore whatever happens happens in a democratic way I mean that's one reason why we have not had rebellion because we have political institutions\nThat that entice people into thinking they don't need that you I think the other answer is that this country is wealthy and uh so it can dispense enough good he used to ... part of the population\nSo that you don't have you know eighty percent angry poor people you have thirty percent poor people and then you have another sixty percent who are not really poor and who I'd just well off\nEnough to think that they are doing well in this system\nNot where we have a kind of a fairly contented middle class which doesn't see revolution as necessary and therefore which except\nThe idea of a reality a of a small elites I'm taking most of the well for the country\nUh and and uh\nAnd the rest of the people sort of paying obey instead of small elite\n... talking with Howard Zinn A People's history of American empire\n... let me pick up with that with that very idea is it's interesting that you almost have with this class distinction has been I mean again you have one percent of the nation only one third of the well ... ... and that leaves about Ninety nine percent that really if you think about it\nIt's almost as if they're pitted against each other to fight for what's left exactly is that a stabilizing force\nWell it it has been a stabilizing force in the sense\nThat does make life stable for the people who are fighting one another and many of whom are left behind but it stabilizes the system because as you said it keeps it keeps people fighting against one another\n\n\n[noise]\n\nMm\nSam cedar here you're listening to the bathtub ring of fire radio [noise]\nWelcome back to ring of fire on my path Antonio shortly before two thousand eight election I interviewed the late historian and author Thomas Johnson about the dangers of American imperialism\nWe've just been through eight years of George Bush's foreign policy disasters in international affairs we're playing a huge role in the two thousand eight elections and there's still a lot of similarities between the election four years ago and the one that will decide in about a month\nThe U.S is still involved in more fiasco was in the middle east terrorist attacks are occurring overseas and foreign policy issues need to be on the minds of all Americans so let's listen to what ... Johnson warn us about before his death\nYou know ... it out of being the author Seventeen books it's hard to choose any one that ah without that I Would say is just ... probably my favorite ... if somebody gets stuff well it\nProbably would be mine to really really that\nOne I've been working on hardest\nWell it's just excellent so let me get right to the heart of it OK okay first of all if you were to describe why we may be or that empire it's on its way towards ruin you have a list of things that I think is yes it is just extremely interest I Want to go down the list and why don't you feel them in as we go okay All right\nYou're talking about the idea that we have a government did driving the nation to tyranny and ruin I mean that's that's the premise\nAnd then you say these are the reasons like let's go down the list ... very compelling argument the chaff here so first of all nation with no outside threats\nThat prominently at war filled that in a little bit\nWell it is to say our commitment probably never formal rather earth wild but our commitment to we have ... and militarism\nA puts us in to the fix of all empires sense of that of a of the Roman republic\nUh we uh we face what are the greatest dilemmas Eddie ... history namely a domestic democracy and a foreign empire history tells us you can have one you can have the other but\nYou can't have both I'll get the most secretive intrusive in repressive government in our history and a president who he describes a serial liar that all of our all of our listeners would agree with that in a little bit\nI think there's just no question that it it is still hard to understand says we presume\nThat George Bush is a is it American and was educated American schools and the what the AOL university to Harvard law school at a few other things he doesn't seem to have ever heard the ah the least obvious elements in the constitution the separation of powers\nThe fact that they are our most important defense against purity and dictatorship\nOr that the this is a a a work of genius above all by a by James Madison but by many\nOthers and that he has systematically subverted ... with ideas that are there isn't a constitutional scholar in the country who would agree with the possible exception of it apparently in saying lawyer sitting at the University of California Berkeley Law school freely James yo\nRight right right and ... but this is a president that would suggest that he's smarter than the frame or so so we know where that goes okay\nThis is the unprecedented wealth disparity that takes place where you have a corporate power\nThat has really in a sense created that disparity and you you in your book you just again every every one of these once you do such a great job renting them out of ... but you talk about brand does and he says this it we we all know Supreme\nCourt justice Brennan said that we can either have democracy in this country we can have a great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can't have both\nHow does it feel that in as far as your theory that we are driving ourselves towards ruined\nWell it's a matter of just open the newspaper\nI mean the crises are on us every day we're the one of the few advanced democracies on earth that doesn't provide health care for all the population are any number of people including personal friends of mine a live without health insurance they simply decided that it doesn't fit into their uh\nTheir budget anymore uh the uh we have a a a fuel crisis that's a\nDriving our economy into a potential bankruptcy\nA standing behind all of this is not to say we don't have the money we do have the money but we're wasting it in the most profit possible way on foreign wars on military equipment that we don't need that in fact we don't even think work we don't care whether it works or not most of this is being spent\nAs a jobs program that the military industrial complex has become\nA ... a intrinsic part of our economy these\nDay well I'm going to get to that and I want to talk about that but but I Want to stop this when you talked about it in order as we drive ourselves towards this abysmal end yeah did you did you really do equate to a Ukraine equate to other civilizations roamed the Greeks are\nThe Soviet Union Japan I mean I could go on with that but it is really really examine yeah but so so but one thing that you say as you say that\nIf you look at all of those failures that one thing that you had was the fact of one party state with two wings\nAnd I'm president claiming almost exclusive executive power were they ignored the rule of law you saw that playing itself out in other in other empires that had held\nNo question a now granted it's there's nothing determinist about this or that or you can wake up and do the right thing the example I use in my book nemesis is the British Empire at the end of World War two\nIt didn't do it well it did it did we stop the better there were many editor mystic throwback later but the British understood that you couldn't continue to use Nazi methods to hold it together the British Empire\nThey said they used to some extent challenge they save themselves and they\nThey did exactly I mean I agree there aren't in or a comment and the origins of the ... and then this is one of the great achievements of Britain and even of Europe that they recognized\nWhat goes on you as you add ... also to your list you add that there has to be this environment where you almost have a cesspool of corruption were him these incest was ties between between corporate American government and that they're really one becomes ... one in the same\nWell the military industrial complex has today so corrupted the Congress that Congress has become the handmade and Congress have been in Congress women have become the surface of the Pentagon they'll do anything to produce a new military base in their district to produce a new contract or one of their companies\nUm [noise] I live in the fifties district of California are representative until just last year was Randy do cutting in Ocean City in federal prison and luckily for eight years for a a it's the lifting drives the military industrial complex\nI had written a piece of the Los Angeles times well before the district attorney and it was right after an unfamiliar a on a saying that just on his filings with the federal election commission he was owned and paid for by uh the big defense contractors\nThe interesting thing to me is I got letters back from that that article saying God I Wish you were my congressman\n[laughter] I could use a good job or you know that uh that's what we ... we make a yeah we make weapons we make pretty good weapons even if we don't make very good cars or a few others such thing\nYou know one thing that she did it almost ties in with that that last anecdote but she gave it up that\nThere is this dynamic that exists the dunes are empires and it's an unwilling to chat unwillingness to change its ability chains you have isolationism you have this overstretched a military government as a professor\nOf international relations I'd have to say we teach that no empire ever voluntarily gave up yes uh but\nThere are a few examples the British did after World War two I think that we'd have to say Gorbachev was doing everything is power\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine right who open\nFriendly relations with France and Germany and to get rid of those crummy satellites that Stalin and built in Eastern Europe but he was stopped cold by vested\nInterests huge vested interest in the in the military as a way of life that's what we mean by most [noise]\nThat was the late ...

extreme event evangelicals that they as you as you point out\nThey renamed themselves evangelicals right cause they for from standpoint as they were they were embarrassed by what was happening they want to disguise it but nevertheless they came away pouting they came away the embattled in in this adversarial kind of a position would rest of the world\nYeah and of course that spilled over into the religious right that we were part of it in the seventies and eighties with the anti abortion movement and then that of course is the formative stage that then eventually\nFull speed ahead to Ted

because we are bitter\nAgainst anybody who is not part of us and that's saved in last paradigm that's the black and white paradigm you're either you know right with Jesus or you're going to hell and you apply that paradigm to American politics and you've got to kind of delusional stuff that I've been writing about in my new book and God said Billy\nVery good stuff by the way thank you which is

of fire radio [noise]\n\nWelcome back to ring of fire I'm Robert F Kennedy junior it's been fifty years since the University of Mississippi old mess was forced to comply with federal immigration laws and since that day fifty years ago the United states\nHas made tremendous progress in racial equality however even with that progress there are still too many segments of the population that are struggling to achieve a quality to progress that we've made so far\nCould not have been achieved if it weren't for the courageous effort of heroic citizens who refused to be treated as second class Americans and I have one of the\nRaid figures of that age my friend James Meredith who was the African American student who was admitted to old mess and I think originally I Know you said at one point you'd been inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural address\nJames Meredith was in the United States Air force from Nineteen fifty wanted Nineteen sixties any attended Jackson State university for two years and then decided to enter the\nSacred citadel of old mess which had been a white enclave since its founding the\nBrown versus board of education case had been issued by the Supreme Court Nineteen fifty four [noise]\nAnd he was twice denied entrance and then\nThe U.S Supreme Court declared that old mess must admit him governor Ross Barnett who had actually supported President Kennedy and his Nineteen sixty\nCampaign became his adversary and President Kennedy's and my father's efforts to get James Meredith admitted to the state and there was a male a at that time that I and many people's view was\nHigh end of the last great battle of the civil war was over ten thousand United States troops was five hundred US marshals a hundred and sixty of them were injured\nAnd the riot as rednecks came in from ... to and from Birmingham and from Selma and from ... lounge county and from as far away as California last squirrel guns and rocks and bricks and attack the life than building\nWhere the U.S marshals had gathered for less than two people were killed\nBut in the end James Meredith with the help of one of my father's closest friends John or answered the university and I think you you said in the past that you slapped very well that night\nRight you actually were in a dorm behind the life see I'm building and you went to sleep early well all the while the riot was going on is that is that right\nYes that that's true that's correct because you had done your job\nAbsolutely and that was to get the government of the United states to use the middle of a force\nOf this nation to in the rye privileges of all the black should've\nWe'll talk about your relationship to the Kennedy Justice Department\nWell I always considered the Justice Department the

W. W. dot P. H. S. dot org ... if you look under community you can connect to us and all of our programs rice that\nIn the piece that page for the mobile farmers market is healthy here mobile farmers market that has the schedule and other events that we support\nFor our right and I guess you guys are probably you're busy so your head out the door and we really really thank you for coming in today and thank you both for the community work that you do for all of\nUs think signing for help and get the roads\nAre adding are about absolutely thank you for coming in today now we're talking about two different things today I noticed the mobile farmers market fires on up and rose on out we're going to visit with Kathleen capes than you are the c._e._o.\nAt life roots is that correct correct All right so one of the things that we also wanted to talk about today would be the fact that ah October is national um disability employment awareness month because there's a lot of people\nAh who try to find a job you you know I can be so difficult in trying to find work right\nAnd then if you have a disability up on top of that it's going to just add to the challenge it seems for a lot of folks\nWell and I believe that this month is really trying to make up lawyers aware that diversifying the workforce can actually help their bottom line around and\nUm we talk about a diversity with race and sex but we don't we we forget that this community is also a a perspective that can really uh support people\nAnd this needs and so this is the months to be able to reflect on that and to be able to understand or will kind of grapes to six we have in the disability employment community\nYeah well that's a very interesting way to to frame of that and to think about that because we all talk about you know how wonderful it is to have community and how much community is made up which absolutely it is\nBut even without knowing I bet you a lot of people just exclude people from thought that you know if they have a disability and that would just be the wrong thing to do\nWe have so many different employees and an wide rage of a\nOf skills and uh employment opportunities and so we want you to think about it we may have a software designers who a design software for Sandia labs who had a stroke at a young age yeah and maybe because of the tea chicken\nOnly designed software Fifteen hours a day not fifty hours a day oh my God maybe you're a business hours a day of course along I have to you know they started Fifteen hours a week oh okay [laughter] so I must say that you know if you're a company who never thought you could get a software designer uh-huh here's\nSomebody who would be extremely proficient yes and offer you an enormous great skill 'em and they're not for a full time job or we also have a an many different opportunities where a most businesses have an essential\nTask or duty and their business that um\nHas high turnover in his costs a lot of money for high turnover might be a bagging groceries or custodial or um inserting whatever you do in the newspaper\nIf I'm a people with disabilities or find the daily challenges and that's what rewards us in our job those challenges and they tend to stay longer and jobs they are not job hoppers\nWell I mean that it's so important I mean just like what you just mentioned I mean that people really do find their dignity and they also find their purpose in life a lot of times with their job\nYou know sometimes it's it it it it would be it would boil down to what it does for all of us is that we we have a way to buy groceries and pay the utilities but also there is that identity that people seek through their work sometimes when that's taken away from them or it's not offered to them it can make life you know just kind of\nA little more productive burdensome on the ... not on our on everything that that it would of course but also just emotionally\nI Would I have a one hundred percent agree Donnie so at life routes one of our core values we've been providing services for people with disabilities in central New Mexico area that's four counties\nFor sixty years now well and um and ... independence is a big core value of ours and if you are an individual with a disability who\nUm maybe getting resources for funding through our government programs they're telling you how to spin that money and when you go get a job in if all you can do is make twenty dollars a week that's twenty dollars you made you decide to how to spend and there's a great amount of dignity in that\nYeah yeah absolutely and I think that's important it's very important that we that we recognize that every single individual if deserving of of just the basic respect or being another human on the planet\nNow ... and and I also want to see what the kind of buying power they have a pre she ate a\nUh individuals who uh we get a lot of great customer feedback\nThat they enjoy having a diverse workforce we uh we provide custodial services at two hundred and fifty buildings when Kass be the federal courthouse Albuquerque libraries um and and these are people want to see their community there and they're part of the community\nI mean I I have here that one fifth of the U.S population or people with disabilities wow so that means a lot of like a trillion dollars is spending power between their families and the individuals\nUm they must certainly are a force that we want to make sure that they're recognized and work for absolutely\nAbsolutely and that is quite a lot of money I mean how funny that you bring that up and how weird that I Would just be thinking about it last night because I was thinking\nI was reading somewhere where somebody was like oh I'm Glad you're in our city spend a lot of money and it was like well that's kind of weird but then I started thinking that that really is what we're all supposed to be trying to do you know that's that's supporting the the economics of our community right\nAbsolutely I mean the more that are individuals are able to earn the less that they need government subsidies the more that they pay taxes and the more that our our community in itself strengthens\nLet's talk a little bit about life roots because we didn't do that at the beginning and I was supposed to do that which is exactly what life roots of how you guys kind of got going um you used to be our CIA is that\nCorrect tricked will in Nineteen fifty eight we're called the rehabilitation center incorporate okay that's where I don't it it became our CIA and it became realizing confidence in independence and\nThen in two thousand eleven we did a branding to lie for it I like better well our board of directors felt like RC I sounded like a time share and they will have a name that reflected our commitments to the community and so that is a process that went through\nTo me it sounds like an old record label yet the guy [laughter] [laughter] well I'm Glad you changed it to life roots because I mean that really is what you're giving people you're given them the roots that they need to to flourish and to have a nice life you know we all deserve that yes you how do people first of all\nCome about getting your services if they if they have a disability\nMonday through friday different hours eleven before at Anna case been hospital over there at the constitution and Wyoming what a great program oh it's a great program I never knew that\nYeah I definitely get that information out there to the folks that\nYou know dealing with it every once in a while well Kathleen thank you so much
