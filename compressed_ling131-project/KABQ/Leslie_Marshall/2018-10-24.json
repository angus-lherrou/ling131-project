they dropped the word Republican from their name and that has been the Democratic party ever since the founding of the Republicans actually it's the oldest political party in America\nSo people who describe themselves as\nDemocrats or for that matter back in the founding era they more frequently refer to themselves as Republicans Jefferson referred to himself as a Republican and talked about Republican principles\nIt was always the small are they might using this concept of government I Believe in this form of government and and but now you say are you know are you a Democrat well yeah I'm a big D Democrat that means I'm a member of this political party I'm a small D Democrat\nI Believe and the concept of democracy which is by the way in peril right now sell it makes sense maverick\nWell ... ... sure I'm both\nOkay All right 'cause I was trying to parse that I\nKnow they're not they're not mutually exclusive it's it's basically you're talking either about political theory or about party about partisan politics so that\nKind of like a a rectangle square but it squares and rectangles type of\nDeal that would be sort of and the same thing with Republican he can be a small are Republicans believe in you know republics as a form of governance or you can be at a big are Republican believing in you know being a member of the Republican Party maverick I got I'm On the line but thanks for the question I Love those kind of questions for us in a high point North Carolina ... what's up\n[noise] how you doing I just wanted to speak about this a bombing mhm um I think it's despicable and in my personal opinion I think all of that ... comes from the top which is down to yeah\nNow as well yeah I ... a Governor Cuomo just just set a New York state and by the way my if I can interrupt you just just for a second Horace ... within a news flash year I'm Shaun you said they just found another one where Maxine Waters office they just intercepted a suspicious package and Maxine Waters off his number one and number two\nYou know we've got a call earlier from somebody's suggesting that uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a package because uh you know Bernie people don't like her a turns out that all of these bombs have Debbie Wasserman Schultz is\nHome address or opposite dress as the return address none were actually sent to her but one was supposed to be sent to Eric Holder or somebody\nAnd uh because they had the wrong address for this person it got sent back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz which is how she ended up with one but she was not the targeted this anyhow Horace forget my interruption back to you\nPart of the things that shouldn't be doing now right now not tomorrow or next next week they should have a way to get Donald Trump\nAnd how do you stay out of work with because he's in the country down she shouldn't go to jail they should put on the jail them actually Mitch McConnell all of them get a new one in the way we\nCan go to court myself and then the conviction let them fail less day\nThank yours I get your passion and I am you know I I Try to stay away from salvation is thinking you know something will save us eventually but I Am looking forward to Robert Mueller's report and if it has the kind of bomb shells in it that I suspect it will\nAh ... we may be accomplishing exactly not not under the jail kind of stuff you
