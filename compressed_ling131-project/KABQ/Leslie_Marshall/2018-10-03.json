in fact it's so often that we forget the previous one I I don't remember what the previous outrage was that Donald Trump dropped into the discourse is clearly\nOnly governing either this is not breaking any news by this ban is to make sure that we're all clear on this is only the president of the forty percenters were stupid enough to continue following him corn gullible enough to believe this nonstop fiction that he fabricates every damn day\nYeah I'm Sorry I tried to something else marvelous happened no no I just bought you weren't used to do you remember the previous low low was yesterday morning when he said I'm worried about the boys in America young women are doing great and I thought it was when he insulted the female report that was you know what do you do stuff\nAnd

president\nAnd yet he stood there on national television\nOpenly mocking them and insulting them and talking over them and being jerks though he is the president of the United states I mean Obama made this observation time and time again about his own presidency he's president of all of the people not just the people who voted for him\nAnd Donald Trump doesn't understand that and as I said his supporters are entirely clueless and I don't know even\nYeah nobody you heard any read my hate letter that we're not doing anything not conducive for America you know he did a hate mail today from a
