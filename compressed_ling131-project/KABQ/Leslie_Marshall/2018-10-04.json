I think the rest of them are idiots they're just going to push it through OK you we yuppies you you got your little you catch a little investigation jak now move along right and why you gotta you gotta say hey wait a minute like enough is enough\nYou also treated Trump he drank one evening in high school not what we're talking about and also just accused some unnamed Democrat a very bad behavior that's not ridiculous or inflammatory ends and insane and like most everything he says ... you know was on through\nA ... out of his asked that Oh yes I really you happen to see him some unnamed democratic senator behaving written drunk and attempting rape really you just happen to see that\nYeah yeah and and and also I mean I I'm pretty sure they're on a heck of a lot of Democratic senators are getting drunk with Donald Trump yeah come on they're not hanging out with them and not\nSocializing with them they're not going to events with them they're not around him um I did this is not I mean it's\nJust another one is like you know ridiculous word on it I mean he's not he's he's lashing out and there's no there's no factual basis for any checking I keep\nSaying I Know in the ... the liberal but I keep saying this is not over yet this is because this is not going to stop and we all can see I Know that they're armed we will make sure he's impeach but I mean there are forty witnesses ... what do we know they don't come forward that the FBI will not talk they did not talk to judge Kavanaugh or\nYou know Dr Ford I mean this is a is such an obvious sham\nWell let's get let's get beyond that even at this moment right like even if they're going to turn around and say okay the F your porch and find any were were you there when he launched into that angry ... read and his partisan attacks\nAnd he clear like personality flaw\nIn his tears when he's supposed to be an emotional is impartial fair right judge with an even temperament\nI mean generally lashing out the last ... members of the Senate I mean it's bad enough\nThat should've been game over at actually irrelevant whether or not any of this happened and how he conducted himself during the hearing\nHad ... which now National Council and churches calls for Brett Kavanaugh's withdrawal ... twelve hundred Walter law professors\nTo have a urged them not from just based on you know judicial temperament as\nLonely there was a separate lists of like nine hundred email lawyers who said don't do it I mean it's ... like the lift and and the people coming in and it's you know now it's like this is the hill you guys want to die on fine like that yeah I I just I don't get it I just I don't get the need to repeat\nAnd I don't get the women that are ... again ... please explain that to me yeah can we talk about something in the artist can be Thirteen\nCars Jackie we've talked about this there are girls like you and me and Suzanne like girlfriend girlfriends that like you know generally have other women's back and then I'm Sorry there are Sarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway said to me ... that are ... you're\nOn the only the women that are behind Trump or laughing and I ... and ... there are signs when mocking yeah yeah I'm here yeah here's Kellyanne Conway\nAnd they have like a ... by all of us to do with me and they tried to find\nWe have ... planes that they can do so in her memory gas or and get her factual emphasis is is that is part of the evidence gathering process and any time for truth and there is the first time that they're searching for truth are already voting against what am\nI right I mean it is yeah this is after she came forward that she was sexually assaulted she said oh we've been treating her like a Febreze egg\nPostal yeah oh it's so\nI mean I mean look if you if you don't if you didn't watch Dr force testimony and think oh my God you don't have a heart this this woman was composed she was honest she was clear it is ... evidence\nThat this is coming from this is coming from a place of the need to do the right thing and this isn't this isn't and what did she gaining from what is this woman gaining from that now there's there's nothing to come from it other than than doing what's right by your country and\nWe're accused of not having souls right where I feel for this one I the we're the one I mean no soul\nYeah sailor senators did that yesterday jak they're kind of blame Democrats I mean ... like Democrats could have made what are we up to now fifty people including the accusers come forward about with the same thing\nI mean this yeah this is Josh left wing conspiracy is really starting out and why didn't that happen to didn't Gorsuch early don't or go on and on right anybody except for my\n... and and look I mean having a despicable I mean what we're learning about him this is an entitled brat who is angry because he thinks it's do you have to understand why the stuffy did when he was younger is coming back to haunt him I it's so\nWhat's really it was more a more upsetting to me then that is how common he is here our type yeah that is it's so common it has that he's happening to try to run for yeah Supreme Court though it's very it's very true\nYeah I mean we you know we know well\nI Wish I Would say we know a lot of men like\nThis and unfortunately I think I probably dated a handful of them out\nAnd the culture in colleges and universities and this is ... ironically as the only gay woman here [laughter] you know saying Jackie I'm enraged and I've never been sexually assaulted I mean I I\nWas I said you know we need to start a thank you movement for the good guys because I write I I I said I Need to go back and think every guy I went to high school a Catholic school with everyone\nAnd went to USC with 'cause I I've never had a guy not stop when I said stop and it's and beyond that Jackie some of my best\nMale once said keep going and they ... what's that way why is it what about the ones where you said keep\nGoing and they said yeah well that's one good listen Jackie my point is no but I mean some of my best guy ... you know male friends have to worry about being protectors of women yeah in ... make sure they got home safe took their shoes off put him to bed so bad for the good men right now yeah honestly\nWell yeah I mean that's the other thing too I mean it wouldn't have to get the bad time for men and oh it's a bad time for bad men\n... and yes Jackie\nThe other is editor in chief of investigate Russia this must also\nHaunt you in the way like yesterday we talked about this story that him questioning this FBI probe is is a perfect you know pre costs her to how he would squelch the dollar pro right I mean and obviously part of getting cabinet is is that he believes you know the president's above the law\nAnd you know this case that would take away double jeopardy so you know you he he could pardon everybody I mean it it is like the slow moving\nDisaster isn't it where you're just like oh my God we see what you're doing\nYeah I mean it has to be there is no other reason why wouldn't go back to that federal society I mean the ... the reason these so adamant about cabinet ... back to the Russia probe and the fact that the calving off leaves at the president's about it it doesn't make any others and why they would be willing to he doesn't have a personal investment and having other than the when\nUm and he can get any other conservative justices that this has got to do with what I'll be able to do was regarded Russia pro or if Kavanaugh strength\nAnd that's just above the law means that he's not the president he's actually a dictator yeah\nRight right yeah that's what we're going up for his job we are it's just it's a slow crawl towards that and it's to be a faster\nChecking your posted um on investigate Russia about two prosecutors departing the Mueller team I'm now that their work on the Manafort cases complete ... see if the defense attorney is a says they're downsizing I think they wouldn't be letting people go and lift their winding down um so you know there's speculation as you know\nAre you know again he's winding down several reports are also doing quick succession promoter or federal prosecutors after the midterms are as they moved to sentencing what is your take on what to do all this means\nUm you know I I don't know because you don't have the timeframe and we don't hear that\nAnything there's a leaks coming from all his office um but I have to think at this point he's got a lot of the ducks in a row\nUm you know as we said this is so multi faceted and there's so many components to this um it does seem like he's got I mean I think it's like a dozen witnesses at this point you've come to testify before the grand jury that Roger Stone [noise] um I I Would imagine that he's honing in on\nAny kind of cooperation through like Jared Kushner Donald Trump junior I mean I think he thinks these are people that need to be concerned um the timeframe should have to know but I think the Miller is a smart guy right and some he's gonna he's gonna let it all up so that\nGod Forbid something does happen I mean he's he's he's going to have everything all the evidence will be there um and I think that he's he he sees what's going on as well and he knows that the new terms could be\nOf a problem in terms of after the midterm struggle feel compelled to do something sessions or Rosen seen like I just yeah I don't know I I have to think that millers you know playing ten steps ahead of where Trump is now to\nSomeone I think oh go ahead and go no go ahead sorry I was just gonna say the prosecutors who\nLeft the team were specifically working on the Manafort shot and now that Manafort's cooperating\nI think that they're going they're going back to their old depart right\nInto I I you know I think they're probably relieved of their duties and that could\nWrite as someone said the only presidential alert I Want is one from the next president telling us that Trump has choked on a pretzel and his selling\nAnd loving [laughter] ah\nYeah I was I not alert thing was I was upset I was when I opt out of town I don't want to yeah oh which brought on an airplane mode Trump TV social there too yeah yeah I Do on the TV isn't that horrible just the word presidential has given us all PTOs because of who it refers to right now you're

actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including fusion accessories and vegetable you'll know if you're a true prices competitive ... shows you what other people are paying\nFor [noise]\nTo see so much has decided to [noise] oh it is the devil you know show\nMe the answers in the studio\nAnd just read for say one wants to resign art so this is a Senator Dianne Feinstein a reacting to this a sham FBI investigation this morning\nNotable part of this report is what's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor does the FBI interview shock to Boise for\nWhat we heard from numerous people over the last few days seeking to provide information to the FBI we have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interview\nWhat struck me too is that obviously more stuff as you said look this isn't going to end more stuff came out about Clarence Thomas ... absolutely proved Anita Hill's case and they at least did an FBI investigation and called other witnesses this has been out in twenty Eighteen\nHas been even worse way worse than it and and the allegations are much more serious what is the justification for not interviewing the two main evil ... because he would perjure themselves but he would write he's already perjured himself how many times before the Senate I mean ... yeah okay\nUm art so a Kellyanne Conway was on was young Morning Joe\nMill el ... was was he was responding to kill your home it can only about ... okay yes to sing we've been treating a doctor for to delicately okay something\nChristine Blasey Ford has put herself out there and she has\nBeen in during the blinding lights\nOf questions surrounding her life\nHer credibility and her story and I was really struck by Kellyanne Conway saying that she's been treated like a fabric the eggs [noise]\nThat's really interesting I find that fascinating actually because Kellyanne Conway went on a Sunday show and the middle of making her point she announced that she is a victim of sexual assault\nOh my gosh okay well women should be heard and apparently they get treated like fabricate eggs so tell us your story because your attacker\nWho broke the law who hurts you\nYou seem to really uncomfortable when you let that slip out your voice got small your voice cracked you have to clear your throat you were really uncomfortable just saying I Am a victim of sexual assault and you know what I say that as a victim of sexual assault myself\nWhy can't be the egg\nKellyanne the fabric ... egg and tell your story because you say women should be heard you talk to both sides are now you say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding compelling well let's hear yours\nIs very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice\nThank you wow\nIs that when Joe tried to cut her yeah OK well shouldn't hold on I'm not I'm no value and okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect their breath for headaches predator\nPresident and make an announcement that the victim of a sexual assault which therefore for some reason makes everybody not ask you about it\nIf women are being treated like ... when they announced their stories then he'll go ahead and tell yours and see how easy it is okay that was as low as it gets I Would get up and leave if I were you today I Would never want to face the cameras again unless you're willing to tell your story\nJust like Dr Ford did\nOkay and see what it feels like can be treated like a fabric right egg as you say\nYou have such great quick tight little points that he wanted to throw out there and this one's not gonna fly you can't use being a victim of sexual assault throw it out there\nAnd then literally dirty Solly the name of someone who has stepped in front of the cameras before the United states of America and told her story and you say that she's being treated like a ... that's\nThat's just delicious at this point you know the president we get him but Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway I Would just like to say you two are single handedly setting back when and I would suggest you try and turn it around\nWow him for a girl yeah\nWow I mean this is what's so horrible about how full\nList it seems like killing ... Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nHave become that I said the same thing here is right I hate to say it like I I\nJust wouldn't put anything past her and it was weird the way she said it without ... and then seemed to blame women in the same sentence responsible for our own behavior I don't blame the attacker tap or for that it didn't seem like another one of her talking points do you and you're like these two women believe their own cons or not\nYou think they really ... I don't know I I don't understand the women in the bleachers behind Trump now laughing and applauding him mocking a sexual assault survivor I mean I don't I just like I don't what does that mean when you are fighting against your own interests that's fascinating yeah I don't yeah here's a\nOh we don't ... I'm Sorry yeah I'm Sorry go to nine this is yeah uh ... again I don't understand you blame Democrats for this but\nThis is higher process has been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats didn't do this the way that it should've been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they've undermining our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in the inappropriate Nestle which they've conducted themselves", "show_name": "Leslie Marshall", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "04"}
