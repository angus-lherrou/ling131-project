AOL and can you hear me do\nIt is not working okay I'm going to put that on hold and I'm going to pick up ... call in Seattle ... what's on your mind that\nHey Tom amazing I got through um I'm interested what your thought is on the wolf pack initiatives to to get money out of politics via a constitutional amendment [noise]\nUh if uh you know I've had this conversation with ... if if they're calling for a constitutional convention which is what this all started out as I you know so are the Koch brothers and the Koch brothers have thirty two out of thirty six necessary states signed up for it already\nAnd or I guess twenty eight of of the thirty to necessarily safe to start it and then they need thirty ... thirty six to to finalize a I think it would be a huge mistake if that's the case on the other hand uh I understand that they have kind of over time change this to say okay we're going to use the article five process\nTo a push a ... a a constitutional amendment up from the states but without actually having a constitutional convention where we open up the constitution take it apart tinker with it figure out what's going on all that kind of stuff and uh so\nYou know I I haven't talked to a chunk in about a year on it so I I'm not sure where he's at right now but if they're just pushing the constitutional convention\nYou know uh and and if they have joined with the coalition that move to amend as part of and Public Citizen was a part of there's a whole bunch of organizations who are working on this and who are pushing you know really really good constitutional conventions in that case I I you know I Would be supportive of it so anyhow that's that's a little ... thanks a lot for the call\nDo we have we have Eleanor Simon it's working Elon around or Alan\nAnd here I Am at Katy are the are fairly and in Santa Fe waterfowl um there's a lot going on first of all there in the absentee ballots that were assigned in Atlanta over a thousand of them were\nNot allowed on ...\n... they worked discounted by the Atlanta radio station I'm Sorry by the Atlanta not radio station but the the secretary of state for and now the ACLU is suing them a because they're faint signature didn't match give me a break yeah also\nUm we do know that Bloomberg is reporting that Robert Miller who of course is doing the and Russia investigation will have a full report right after and the um right after the ... in the midterms which of course it's going to happen in November six\nAlso now a Donald Trump says he hasn't heard the tape he doesn't know if there's a tape a but we do know that the secretary of state or is coming back from turkey and she says he expects the full report\nFrom the folks are in in in Turkey and what's happening with Saudi Arabia also pro public ... now says that the Trump family did not tell the truth for investors\nOr that they are claimed in Las Vegas that they were sold out but only twenty five percent of the units were sold by two thousand eleven and the result is that they did build a in Fort Lauderdale they entered into foreclosure and so there's many many stories that ProPublica has looked at\nAnd found out that they did not actually wind\nAnd in that way shape or form from that report what I'm seeing as a bloc aligned to the investors Donald lied to the investors the investors lost thirty five or fifty five million dollars or something like that and then right and on top of that members Cyrus Vance\nOh I Do you you\nDon't you know he was a Democrat right and he and he was the prosecutor in New York\nWho was supposed to go after and he let it go the Trump family while he let it go after ... after they made a thirty five thousand dollar campaign contribution to him so now they're starting to look into SARS fast for taken a bribe from the job well that's right back in the day absolutely amazing ... and ... are\nAlso the at the Trump campaign has that they're going to not the Trump campaign and Trump said that he's

issues they lost the Boston Celtics scored Nineteen poison Fifteen ... ate at this point steal a few blocks for three minutes I've traveled in your fantasy sports radio network news up to\nIs ... office yeah yeah I Know and we I think I did about that the other day where I said\nThere the Saudi or the Turks are going to start releasing audio on this and when they started doing that that is the pressure technique you have to understand now there's a three way problem that's going on at devil trying to have salute Leah devils yeah Donald Trump is going to be pressured by turkey\nEveryday secretly to do something about foot tool or Glenn the American resident who lives in Pennsylvania runs all these charter schools who are the ones he uses his opponent\nThis is the guy that Mike Flynn was going to be paid Fifteen million ... remember that yeah now so until Donald Trump starts making some concessions\nTurkey is going to start slowly tripping out this information which could destroy the U.S Saudi relationship will destroy all trust around the world with the Saudis and it will call the Saudis out as the as the ... dictatorship yeah they are there are a few few Craddock dictatorship\nNow it's a question to see how Trump Place to that if he thinks that this is worth playing you're going to hear the Turks back off on their release of audio and more details if he can they can get a concession on if the Turks can't get a concession out um it's going to be a blood they'll release the full audio and video they have like it's going to be\nAwful yeah ... he's about to admit to quote unquote accidental murder why it's likely the Turks were about to release audio the killing what next we'll be declared a road that unfortunate loyalists act by King Abdullah all damage to mecca are so cannot be interrogated trumping NBS will claim victory yeah\nGood point there by the way about being banished to mecca that's this is the way that they get rid of people who are who are bad they don't kill you\nRight when they send you to mecca to pray for the rest of your life like idi Amin was banished to mecca yeah most people don't realize that he died in mecca\nPraying for for all the soldiers that he killed this is way of silencing people but also as a way of maintaining the honor of the families\nThey based on what I heard this morning\nOr by Mike Pompeo they are going to find a prince in the palace who will be a fall guy yeah and it will be don't see the ... yeah yeah it said on telling you they're going to find a Princeton that prints is going to come out and he's going to confess that I've done all this behind the crowds back\nAnd he is going to lose his life\nOr or he's going to lose his life he's going to be banished to mecca\nAnd this story is going to go away of Donald Trump's going to go oh just like travelling all everything is a you know this is the way it is\nYeah oh Kevin who's also guilty okay I'm Talking about Trump saying he trusted a and B S's denials about the show he said U.S intelligence agencies likely gave you definitive evidence two weeks ago a lot of hey you obviously don't believe them because American values and protecting a citizens and residents gets in the way of your personal profit I mean here we go again\nRight it's a it's another Russia story this you're defend any murderous dictator a if there's something in it for him whether it's a stolen presidency high and he's on tape talking about how much money he gets from the Saudis\nYeah you know and look I Know I haven't had my coffee yet but it's time to get into mode um we'll we have a president who was a tyrant just like John Adams a predicted that we would have\nHad some point we have a ... yeah the problem with that as we have enough guard rails and systems in place to stop a tyrant\nKilos dictators he loves to ... he loves the murderers and in all in almost ... gush isn't admiration about how about Kim Jong on you know and you know there are conversations about how we can have you know private in camps things wouldn't be so bad here\nWe have to understand that\nOur system of government was not designed to have people like this in place but we didn't think that we would have a Russian Soviet politburo for Congress who would literally a abdicate their role in protecting the nation and out which costs the U.S resident his life\nAnd if it can cause someone like that is life then what happens when they start you know arresting American citizens overseas and started holding them illegally yeah Donald Trump won't come for you unless you're in the evangelical priest\nYou know just as simple as that I'm\nNot I'm here's another thing you never thought we'd be talking about the president United States calling a woman horse face yesterday a Michael McCain tweeted peak twenty Eighteen is being called horse base by a mushroom\n[laughter]\nStomach Daniel ...

want to watch my pill I Want to watch [laughter] I may leave my panel to go see her panel that Joe ... joins us now good morning Jill good morning how are you trying not to act like a ... a nerd around you as usual\nAt I Love when you do [laughter]\nAnd this is also the only two hours a day when I Am not at my mailbox waiting for your blue wave pin which I've ordered for you as well thank you\nExcellent they knew that will be fabulous [laughter]\nSo listen I obviously you're going to be out here for political on on a lot of news ... or you probably heard this that the there is reporting the Mohler is ready to deliver his key findings but not 'til after the midterms of course\nBut this is where it gets tricky right where I've heard you talk about Watergate I'm not clear Miller's findings will be made public if he doesn't and obtain unsealed indictments the regulations of course he only has to reveal his findings to\nRod Rosenstein who is currently has supervisor right so then the supervisor has discretion about what's given the Congress and what is revealed in public how\nHow do I mean obviously we've heard rumors he's going to fire Rosenstein and and sessions after the midterms what are your fears are your thoughts on all this this morning\nWell fares are like everybody else in America um or maybe not everybody because I'd say it's only Seventy percent of America who feels the way I Do um but that's enough\nTo have the blue wave on\nI Would say the things that gives me hope are\nA couple of things one is that the process that\nWe use during Watergate which was using that grand juries aren't authority to issue a report to Congress is something that Mahler could you do if he is\nBarred from returning an indictment by the rules of the office of legal counsel even though I Do not agree with their legal opinion\nI think president quick be indicted but if he chooses not to for any reason because he believes impeachment of the better process can compile\nAll the evidence that he had into a road map which is what we did and pass it out of the differences we had a Congress that was actually\nActively investigating impeachment at the time\nWe knew we weren't wasting our time and that there was a chance that Congress would take the evidence and use it so our hope is that there will be a blue wave and that there will be enough interest in Congress\nThat they will look at that evidence seriously they will issue subpoenas and do their own investigation and have a real search for truth which hasn't happened yet so there is still that that real opportunity and the other thing that gives me hope\nIs Paula Duncan who was the grant that you're in the Manafort case who said\nI'm a loyal Trump supporter and I think this investigation is a hoax than a witch hunt but the evidence against Manafort is clear and convincing he's\nGuilty on all Eighteen count and so I Hope that Americans will at some point the evidence\nAnd we'll judge the evidence and will make their own conclusion about the guilt of not just Trump but of all those around him who may be named um in any kind of report or indictment [noise]\nUm yeah I remember seeing him on TV talking about it you know that you were you all were disappointed that you had your case all ready to go obviously against Nixon\nI mean that's my fear is that that I feel like we've never been up and get what he did is bad enough but to me Joe this is Watergate times ten if ... what is proven as well we all think which is you know amounts to treason\nI I don't see how we just let this go just over the healing of the country we have to move on or whatever people are going to put forth right\nI I agree\nI think if what we suspect is true is true if in fact\nThere is collusion with a foreign enemy of ours that is much more serious than using Americans to break into the Democratic headquarters if you're using Russians to electronically\nBreak in that is more serious if I mean we see this evidence every day right now I mean his argument that it's a rogue operation how can you say it's a rogue operation\nOf the Saudis yeah when they came in a charter plane that has been used by the Saudi Government they brought a bone cutter with them yeah they they are clearly people who have been linked very clearly\nSaudi security it's not\nA rogue operation yeah to fall for that\nIs really stupid and I can't believe the president would be putting that out and I can't believe that any of his followers will fall for it but\nYeah he always seems to\nSee it that well I mean as you tweeted any profit for Trump or his friends outweighs any concern about human rights and this is again where\nWe keep talking about worse than Watergate worse than Nixon there are so many layers of corruption and law breaking involved in all of this is Arthur\nIt's so true it is so true and it every\nDay in our face Nixon we had to wait for the tape because he didn't say publicly in this case the tweets and public statements\nOf Donald Trump or the equivalent of the discoveries of a tape the differences the tapes came all at once\nAnd shocked the nation yeah we're not shocked anymore because it happens", "show_name": "Leslie Marshall", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "17"}
