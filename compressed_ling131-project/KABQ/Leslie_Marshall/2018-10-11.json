line with us and she foreign correspondent for talk media news uh live from the United nations you can tell look at the career on Twitter\nA loop could the death penalty\nOr we're getting some good news here\nWe are both from within the United states and outside of our borders outside of our borders the decision impacting many more people is that Malaysia other new ... present their new old leader who's I Believe in his early nineties says look ah we are going to set in motion beginning on Monday legislation\nTo outlaw the death penalty and for now there's an immediate ... to twelve hundred plant executions Malaysia a country that uses\nHanging as a punishment for a whole range of crimes including\nThings like drug trafficking which I think we could agree does not rise to the severity of\nExecution that let alone any crime perhaps um Amnesty International praising this Congress and astounding turnaround for a country that had really close to this policy I think a lot of this has to do with the fact of Malaysia has been trying to free up number of its citizens who are on death row in other countries and they found\nUnsurprisingly you have little standing to make that case when you kill people in your own criminal justice system is I think a great development and in Washington state has now become the twentieth stayed in the United states plus the district\nAnd Puerto Rico to also banned the death penalty the Supreme Court in Washington today saying this was an arbitrary\nA type of policy it was not apply but kind of consistency and was often racially motivated and I have to say it's part of I think a momentum behind this unfortunately it's limited\nIt seems to blue state you know since two thousand seven we've seen New Jersey New York New Mexico Illinois Connecticut Maryland Delaware and now Washington all banned the death penalty one\nOf those states have in common so this is a trend I just would hope it leaves blue states at some point and A People's\nConsciences is a you know peaked here uh but again a great day of progress one day on the heels of the un day against the death penalty you see a major state and the major country a reverse course here I think it's a great development\nRemarkable the Orthodox Church and I ... it is this the Russian Orthodox church uh the Greek Orthodox Church there's the topics that the the the Egyptian Orthodox Church I have has granted auto ... fully to Ukraine as church which sounds like a genetic brain disorder and buy those\n[laughter] yeah exactly well this is a big development of for Russia and for Ukraine this is the Orthodox Church based in Constantinople their patriarch\nRuin today after years of appeals from Ukraine now just worth pointing out Ukraine one of the largest orthodox populations in the world or their church has been under the control of the Moscow based Russian Orthodox church do you see\nPatriarchs of Moscow appointing leaders to the church in Ukraine and for centuries calling the churches in Ukraine that don't want to be under ...\nExcuse Mac right they're not you know part of the fate of their parishioners are ... are not part of the communion\nUm has now been reversed a this is a lot of it has to do the interviews I've done with the fact that Russia had been using its Orthodox Church do exert types of influence on Ukraine it was sort of a political force in many ways uh in the church contends noble here\nKnow that they will lose the backing of the Russian Orthodox church there you know patriarchy is has been already warned if you do this if you grant you know as if you turn the church of Ukraine into its own\nEnergy Russia's Orthodox Church will stopped following the Orthodox Church based in in Turkey or they went ahead and did it anyway a lot of this has to do with the fact that now when you take out the Ukrainian churches Ukrainian priest who are part of the orthodox space you take them out of the Russian church the Russian church becomes much\nSmaller uh and so it'll to ensure sort of a contest for power power it\nReminds me of a you know history textbook it seems like an issue that we wouldn't be dealing with in twenty eight team but there's a lot of sort of Ukraine Russia politics at play here and it seems Ukraine has come out in the winter\nFascinating and then there's a Chinese spy and and all the

are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you you don't know where these people are\nBut when we shouldn't do is incite people to violence and so we've asked Cory Booker to retract those words we've asked or the Democrats in general to try to ratchet down and say look we want peaceful doll\nYou can't have your party that you've already be Donald Trump who was actively telling people to punch people at his rallies in August out wearing a right hey your legal bills over and over at these rallies inciting violence but people are shocked you know people in Charlottesville and then say\nBecause ... Cory Booker said what did you say if you you know getting someone's face and tell them what you believe\nThat is not inciting violence Maxine Waters did not inside violence they're talking about peaceful protest there talking I mean ... you sound like when you had all these women are assaulting us that the only thing you because women are telling you their stories with sexual assault that it it's okay if I\nDon't know the ones that were altered not you are kicking you and your turtles show\nYeah exactly to sound like I got angry if you're\nGetting up in someone's face getting up in someone's face really kinda does sound like you want them to get your nose to nose with them and the problem is is rational people my back down\nWhat's gonna happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally comes with a knife to a rally that is going to be negative fascination if this doesn't Roger down and I think the other side needs to really calmer rhetoric down\nOkay where where are the violent rallies Trump yeah what have you made it won't work rally being violent ... never showed up with guns and everything goes rally bank\n\nAnger issuers oh he was talking about his next door neighbor next door neighbor when he said that they could live next door to you yeah yeah yeah\nI'll probably end up living next door to in ... that was over something long clipping subtle yeah yeah [laughter] like where the Trump victory\nNineteen Minutes after the hour this portion of the Seventy militia ... by the zip recorder is that when we got Ryan yes we are recruiting they found the perfect candidate he thinks and\nTesting so far he might have anger issues\nAnd do whatever they ask for someone quieter than Sean because [laughter] you can get so specific\nRecruiter when you sign on board operator who can just get one liners in every once in a right like the comedy than John silent Bob was not available so\nDonald Trump still president okay but in the morning of the fuel the rest of the dog\nWill what is it as good as the goat and a coke making friends with a pony oh I didn't even see that one\nIt was in the field really wants to bring\nWe're losing or to animal beautiful flashes lake there you go what they want us when we have do you have to give people\nRegistered to vote he'll do we get people registered to vote no go videos for you wow you're done with the goats you're harsh man okay\nA Senator Dianne Feinstein said she was a surprise to Trump's singles route during a rally but called it part of his technique of division we were surprised that anything at this point no\nI was the rise she said it's part of a technique division rather than uniting people in this great country at when asked about the lock her up chants at trunks ... she said she was surprised Trump singled me out for a personal letter I received this wasn't anything that was covert are classified um yeah I don't\nI wouldn't be surprised if he volunteered for habitat for humanity that's the only time that without trying that\nWould be a that would be a a\nA slap in the face with the ... squid and you're like really\n... yeah that would be good then I could be like we could watch more go videos\nYou know you could hire the goats sheep to trim your Gratz\nSomebody there's like a ... out there and then you hire them and then they bring goats that and the goats trim your grass wow that is you\nCan do well or or you just called it the ... right oh yeah yeah they ...
