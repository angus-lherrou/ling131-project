head around\n... between the latest trans thing it just all of the agree just things they're doing or trying to do right\nWell and you know what we're hearing is that the reason this is all happening now\nOr you want to talk about that poll that showed that Democrats and independents have been in life and uh and motivated by the cabinet hearing conservatives were not and what polling you're showing Trump and his people is the only thing that even remotely gets them a little excited\nIs craziness so the caravan so the riots of immigrants in California uh so blaming the media so lock her up all of those things are designed to cry and excite the base because they won't wake up for him\nYeah I Try to do something else\nOr a Reuters is reporting this morning that uh the department of justice has should have been getting to the Supreme Court saying that employers can discriminate against trends workers as well mhm yeah that's new great oh because they don't\nWant the protected by civil rights laws you know a lot of\nUh the legal system was coming around on the fact that discrimination discrimination against trans people was based on gender\nYeah and uh that they should be recognized under our civil rights laws but we see that Trump is no interest inequality he has only interest in whatever will benefit himself in the moment\nYeah and he thinks that picking on trans people is what's going to benefit himself yeah right now and you know who's going to hurt him the most with the people who are revolting away from him or you know women in the suburbs who support or

political system are saying it's only a matter of time it's quite a look at what happened to Gabby Giffords or a couple of years ago um ... we can't the only thing that we can do right now\nPray hope and pray that nobody is injured by one of these bombs because who knows how many are out there now or at especially you know any of the people who they're targeting any of the first responders who

that's nice um X. whether trust at Trump's rhetoric might have increased the threats he said well you mean like a congresswoman waters comments saying they should drive Republicans out of public\nShe didn't say that this is what Trump specializes in\nSaying things to his opponents did not say my original tweet he said Maxine Waters is urging harm to my supporters no absolute in for a lot of people didn't hear her original comments that is not at all what she said she was talking about peaceful protest ... yeah um\n[noise] all that kind or a Eric Holder saying they should kick Republicans when they're down again not what right now when he said he okay\nHe said at that time it was not meant literally literally\nOkay\nA asked about the ... attacking the mainstream media Gingrich smiled and said the mainstream media often have earned it oh I see so when we eat these comments just remain the same when someone is as seriously injured or killed\nUm he said I don't think there's a direct connection between Trump and the people in audible yes okay look the people you're talking about I hadn't been people who've been very hostile to conservatives very he added for emphasis oh I see that's not\nOn the day that all of those people could have died there was just an assassination about that's what makes me sad is that there's a lack of humanity in our country now that these are

very deceptive and he would be asked to vote for that and I'm I'm urging everyone to vote against them and if you want more information go to the people and the dot com and that will explain why you should vote again every and then on the north Carolina ballot\nI appreciate are saying that I mean that's what happened to us in two thousand and eight when broke Obama won the presidency in California probably has because of the wording on it was so bad that it said marriage equality\nAnd so people were like yeah some for marriage equality and if you voted yes you were actually voting against it but it's such an important thing that I don't read these amendments and whatever the title is yeah is misleading so I appreciate that and that should be in every state every state um caring and\nKen said a stuffed a Tuesday show guy called the complain the judges aren't identified as Republican or Democrat I wanted to know they can go to your state's Democratic Party website get a sample ballot will tell you who to vote for if you want to build a straight ticket this often includes issues if the party has a stance on them I Do it before every election on our print them for my kids to\nThank you for that 'cause someone asked me about the other day to make sense but judges don't supposedly have a political party they're supposed to be bipartisan but they're not we're using is really important fair judicial temperament of Brett Kavanaugh ...

there [noise] God Bless the ACLU guns lift the N. double ACP people are fighting back\nTheir lifting over going we're going to get free rides to the pole we're going to give rise to that you know the place where they moved to the polling place a mile outside of town and a mile from the bus stop and you know\nUm any with a black students who Texas county over limited early voting locations a group of students at a historically black University of Texas suing county officials for not providing enough early voting locations on campus saying they're discriminating against students based on their race and age\nI'm ... noted the election officials failed to establish a single early voting location on campus during the entire first weeks polls are open this is all about better ... you know what his laser targeted to a Heidi Heitkamp to better will work\nOn the suit says limited early voting in Perry view um we're Seventy nine percent of the voting age population is black is illegal because nearby towns in the county with more voters who are less who are white and less of who were ages Eighteen and twenty I have many more early voting opportunities um ... yeah and this again they're saying because of course\nBetter was is motivating young people minority people\nJust this morning and then someone will correct me if I'm wrong 'cause that's what listeners do but I think it's the Dallas Morning news just actually endorsing them and that means every every major newspaper in Texas that has endorsed\nThe candidate has endorsed Beto O'Rourke yes and I read that earlier that's huge massive\nOne of the good things that just happened in Georgia I was just going to say look you're talking about drugs were yeah so this is what I wanted to talk about Georgia and Stacey Abrams I mean this I\nThink of all of that this is probably the most egregious sure absolutely um ... okay votes for Democrats DCA comes or being changed to Republican Brian Kemp the Georgia N. double ACP is finally can play claiming votes for Stacey Abrams have been changed the uh there um and in double ACP estate conference electronically file complaints\nWith the Georgia secretary of state's office which is headed by camp ... yet conveniently enough\nClaiming the votes cast Rayburn Zimbardo and dodge counties were initially registered to camp\nThe Georgia they're also plan to file complaints and Henry and ... counties uh they said we've experienced this before they ended up taking these old dilapidated machines on service the ones giving the problems they should have been replaced about ten years ago we heard about this during a Bush carry\nThe people ... ... absolutely so they voted care and they saw on the machine flip it you're going what's that about the default goes to the Republican somehow or something like I mean it's it's\nIf it's if it's touch screen that's where I was reading that it's real easy to just calibrate them so when you touch one part of the screeners registers\nYet how we're going over yeah goes to the Republican yeah yeah one of the things though and and just a positive note I don't know if you saw this but I'm In Georgia a judge actually blocked the election officials are rejecting the bouts with suspected signature mismatch ... absentee ballots we mentioned that earlier that yes you that's what I'm\nSaying I said earlier Dana democracy is hanging by threaten yeah but it's hanging and do this\nAgain I Know what I what we were so repetitive at this point when you do this three hours a day we have\nGot and I do like Gaga show [laughter] I mean he brought you to vote or we have right you're right right now the courts are holding on this stuff\nRight they're going to sit at the same thing we said the common sense that this this exact match is not fair it's not legal it's right to the other thing is is that Kim actually had what thirty five thousand people taken off\nThe voter list because they said they had moved and they were actually in the ... and they just had noted in previous election\n... palace learn one in ten Georgia voters were removed from the rolls at some point in twenty Seventeen um ... they just have a
