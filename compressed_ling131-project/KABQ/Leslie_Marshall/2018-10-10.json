John arm in here with you and bill in\nShawnee, Kansas hey bill what's on your mind today\nTom ... I I was on the way home in the car when I heard you played that Dianne Feinstein a lock her up clip yeah and I'm picturing in my mind's eye 'cause I had seen it\nBefore and what do you think Trump's performance art the faces and the gestures and the jokes at his rallies is it ever going to become stale too that they know\nNow and he's very good at it he's a he's a very good performer and that's why president right now Ronald Reagan was a good performer too\nRight\nThey do remember that say I I was just wondering if you thought it was going to get stale\nI don't think so I think I think these people have bought into a cult of personality and and you know when you die and we actually we talked about this at at link that up maybe it's been more than a year now\nBut if you look at the history I Lived in Germany for a year and I knew I literally news some old Nazis I mean elderly Nazis who are still not six and I knew elderly Nazis who were embarrassed Nazis and I knew elderly Nazis or you know never again you know whatever\nAnd what I learned from that experience and I have a good friend who is Japanese I mean you know from Japan friday came live the United states for five years he's back in Japan Louise I've stayed at his home\nUm and uh you know talking to him about his parents' generation is is more my age so he wasn't there for ... but I'm\nIn both cases the people bought into the cult being sold by tell Joe in Japan and Hitler and Germany they completely you know large enough enough of the people bought into it that the country basically had become seized by a cult\nAnd the only way you can de program an entire nation from a cold is essentially to destroy it you know they had to have because they believed in the fallibility of Hitler into Asia they believe that these guys were absolutely right and they had the answer to every problem\nAnd it wasn't until they were defeated in war that they figured out that it was wrong\nI Would argue that similarly there was a Cold War and hardy and brought into the United states in Nineteen twenty when he ran for president on the platform of dropping the top tax rate from Ninety One percent or Seventy five percent down to twenty five percent and dean regulating business and and uh\nUh you know his in fact his slogan was more business and government less government and business I'm so excited me\nLess government and business more\nOr whatever it was then governor yeah\nA lot more business and government they deregulated privatize was his agenda sure and that that caller was really bought into the roaring twenties even though average working people didn't see an income increase the rich got fabulously Richard everybody thought the country was doing really really well during the twenties and then when that bubble burst in Nineteen twenty nine\nIn the cold the Republican call which had completely sees the country and the Republicans control this country from end to end\nAnd and control all three branches of federal government everything right\nWhen that bubble burst the American people said holy cow when we're ...\nAnd that's what it takes to get people out of a cult they have to be able to step away from it and look back and say wow I didn't realize at that point in time that I was just you know I had bought into this and that's what it's going to take to deep programs the Trump called\nAnd as long as they've got Fox News and right wing hate radio run by billionaires feeding them constantly call material\nIs going to take it's going to make something really really dramatic\nMore than just an election Bill thanks for the call is great question\nAnd one that we uh we don't think about for\nThanks so much for being with us today because you know it's all keep our thoughts and prayers for

back\nFrom Washington\nGood morning by soft on good morning devotees burn your previous caller I just read yesterday but David Ogden at at our guns all is are planning a walkout for election day where there were students are going to leave their schools and they're going to march on down to their local precinct and vote\nGood these are things that we're not hearing about in terms of young voters and I I'm skeptical just as much as anyone else in terms of the young voters turning out but that bad in particular is good news\nYeah well I mean to you tweeted among other people you said there is an exodus of women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump um and again you have a matter how they try to keep spending this Kavanaugh stuff and Trump's ego women loved in women are very angry about the Democrat hoax it's like yeah no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women all of a women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has CNN's new generic ballot pool has women opting for democratic candidates sixty three to thirty three gender gap as the net\nThirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time about this blue wave is going to be female but I also say what you say every day don't get happy you know don't focus on any polls don't because it was one showing democratic enthusiasm way down after the Kavanaugh thing for a day and everybody freaked out right\nYeah well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality is that we kinda are in a place where we have to scare our own people into voting yeah\n[laughter] you know like literally we got to get a Malcolm they have to go door to door disturb people\nVote out as just knock knock knock chow chow chow okay\n[laughter] mine the trick or treaters they won't even\nGo just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door\nUntil they come down to vote\nBut I mean it's true but I think we're underestimating the number of\nVoters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now the time to rise up because again if only women voted weed out of the most progressive country of the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party\nYeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm like I was saying it it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced the Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keep saying voting by mail was a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr own a lot of these machines broke who said oh well\nYeah and and as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans\nWhat I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of winning\nBack at least one chamber of Congress and you know we've got all these things voter id as I said and and gerrymandering and the Russians and so on\nRight but we're not they have not invented the glasses that can see a Jared Kushner's hidden genius that she's\nRight well we have to stay in in in that post to the end of the year so she has to make nice with the clown dictator so you know of course she's going to say these

I guess I Would I part company with you on that I don't I don't see how this is a Democrat hoax we had what forty people that wanted to talk to the FBI I mean that's quite a a a hoax if the Democrats orchestrated all of these people\nThat know no I just think the way that the way that Dr Ford was brought on the American landscape and the way she was sort of pushed out there just\nReally didn't it didn't feel\nRight he was uncomfortable Dianne Feinstein come on let's let's do better\nUm okay All right well let's let's move on from that because now we're now we're going to have a job and make a fight 'cause I don't I don't I don't think Diane Feinstein leaked it but let's you know you also went on to talk about this unbelievable photo op we have again we're you know Brett Kavanaugh has already\nBeen sworn in and then you you you tweeted strange and grace list proceedings at the White House yesterday Democrats need to stay focused your anger is not enough to be better um because once again to proclaim him innocent project an end to apologize to him on behalf of the American people and it just\nIt was yeah thanks yeah it was disgusting and it was so great was five was much much work it was sad but you know for\nUm I don't think Democrats have anything to do but to look in the mirror and media ... members of the media as well that was that was brought by the media\nThe fell for all of this phone line and sinker and data to cover the story not to get personal you had some media tell their personal stories of being sexual assault than that you know\nI Believe women and all that you know you can't do that you're covering a story\nAnd did he or didn't see that is the question that we don't have the answer to not me too because I Will tell you that saying you're there were sexually assaulted and I can but Dr Ford is convicting him you're a member of the media what happened\nAnd it it became about a movement and it became about politics and we got wrapped up and quite frankly a lot of members of the media out at themselves they're supposed to be objective they weren't\nAs Trump got what he wanted you didn't like that trains in class was the other night you shouldn't have made it happen\nNow well you know ... I Know with your dad and I I don't know if you know my dad ran with Barry Goldwater and sixty four um oh wow you know I think what we both just want a better politics again [laughter] you know better better sort of\nAnd the Democrats come forward with good people and great people\nHave you done with that and I give you total credit for ... for making Joe leave the Republican Party by the way
