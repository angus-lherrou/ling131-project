said eight appears to be harder than\nI mean did it feel like he was laughing when he's er smirking when he said those looked a little\nMurky and it reminded me a little bit of of Bush junior when he would talk about serious things but you see that little smirk on his face you know but he was dumb just so she could be true and maybe it's a southern thing um 'cause it gee did look a little happy about it in a weird way\nI thought it was more like when you talked about with capital what was I don't fit rollout of going to whisper it right well maybe but also the person with your ... to ... whisper he would\nHe said he said uh I don't know other than what you might normally expect he may have been it appears to be partisan but that will be determined by the facts as the case goes forward I'm not able to\nComment on that I got back over one look at the ban yeah [laughter]\nAnd we're going to ... we did that's what a ban on looks like what's the ban would turn into if he was a transformer [laughter]\nThat'd be most actor and I'm really upset with Michael from about giving about jokes that was that was a good one yeah but at least you retreated it I Believe you're sort of out of north give credit where credit's due I don't steal to people's material\nAnd Christopher Wray was asked what role you think the rhetoric in the political arena might have played in this and he said we're focused not on the talk but on the work we're concerned about people committing acts of violence in any motivation so he he didn't take the bait\nThe media has a major role to play [noise] whether\n[noise] right [noise] where John McCain would take it back now [noise]\n\nAbout when I'm\nGlad you didn't have a major role to play as far\nAs [noise] old [noise] and as far as every [noise]\nWhat about the tone of your crowd yeah it's he riled up\nHe's he's still pass stick terrorism is what it is called which is basically somebody with a bully pulpit or or a weighted he's not inciting a riot because that's very specific at the moment but he's he's riding a flame to somebody out there and they give\nTheir mission he was like um who wasn't Steve Schmidt over the weekend was saying that like when he said nationalist white nationalist know exactly what oh they absolutely it's like the big deal in line to be used in the debate against racist during the ... you may not be racist but race is like you are and that's what matters\nExactly Judd Apatow tweeted um he's always promoted hate he planted so many seats we need to vote out the GOP support all of this and never announces mad at it and he's at Judd Apatow is right and he also makes a good television\nOn but yeah I mean it's it's that is what has happened on an silent majority treated at twenty six teens I

movie um I guess who we have coming up right now who he had two or three\nHow are you um good good to talk to detect you use search show 'em huh too bad there wasn't any news over the weekend\nNo no no I didn't spend my weekend in a total agitation curled up in a ball and\nYeah you treated out um I'll show you know I'm not dividing the country by telling you which site is against you or ...\nIt it's crazy that that that that Trump and his supporters yelling at CNN as well like I said they don't get it and the people that I can you help me\nWhile I mean this was a that was a response to Trump right all of us who who's saying you know I'm not going to what's not divide the country but the media fight fake news they say so many nice things about me read there were nicer to me that everybody would come together right\nAnd in the morning he just he said while they are the enemy of the people\nYeah I said Travis printed it out for me as well ... yeah I even Mike Pence is saying he's not doing it it's it's we were talking about ... terrorism which is what he is doing and he's he's inciting it not not directly but he's definitely remember like with Bill O'Reilly\nAnd ask Dr ... doses [laughter]\nRight well I mean ... you know that there but there is a way in which\nHe's trying to instill fear in population I mean if you want to talk about terrorism is doing that I mean there is you know you're so used to Catholic I they were ... where you're where you're using language to divide people for your own purposes\nAnd I just you know he is incapable of being president of the countries even ... or ... and the\n... the cost of the attacks on Democrats way in which you make Democrats and to the enemy right I mean it's it's it's shocking but it but in some ways the violence these just\nAnd that but hold out and you know out cropping from this\nRight yeah he he treated the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives in me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country actually it is they're faking dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand huh\n[laughter] and then then again this is one of those times or where it's almost always with him that when he says something about somebody else he's actually talking about himself right you know he doesn't understand the extent to which what he's doing is dividing the country maybe he does and he just doesn't give a damn\nThat well there's that and he I mean it's it's what he had done has given permission for all of this to be out in the open yeah you know I mean when when was this ... you know he was a father figure to say well he gave the guy permission to do what he did\nHe did he he's he's given every bit of hate in this country some kind of cover whether it's by not you know not reacting strongly to things like Charlottesville ... I'm not immediately demanding that uh\nThat there'll be some kind of investigation of anti Semitism in this country after the after Pittsburgh [noise] um\nYou know just simply by by saying you know whatever obligatory or\nWhat ever obligatory words you can come up with like yeah yeah that was bad and we condemn it and then moving on to attacking whoever's next in his eyesight or whoever pops up on Fox and friends then uh it's it's just all be uh\nWell yeah I mean he he he blaming the media for reporting what he's saying\nYeah I mean they don't even have to to comment they just have to put it out there\nHow dare you say that I encourage people to a beat up protesters at the rally where I encourage people to speed up\nProtests around exactly and you also tweeted if your response to criticism of right wing violence is you're wrong because the Pittsburgh shooter didn't like Trump because Trump doesn't hate using up you've already lost the argument you are spot on as usual\nAnd that I'd get I've gotten that over and over from people well how can you say that this was about Trump because you know this guy hated\nTrump and it's like well yeah OK but that doesn't mean that Trump is doing something to make anti Semite\nYou'll feel like they have some kind of power or or that or that they have some kind of stay in in in our national dialogue\nExactly I mean the fact that that he used the word nationalist when we all know what code that is an ... which is another code word on granted the shooter called trend the global list but um\nAnd it's like we know what he's talking about like like Andrew Gillum said to ... oh I don't think you are racist interest is racist think you are\nThat yeah it was stressful he blamed me for my credit card debt and I live in town for building that man cave\nIt's awesome anyway we stop blaming each other dinner homework and read that a smart way to consolidate debt is to get a fixed rate loan but getting a loan was brutal and time drain so I was in my man cave researching personal loans and I found the best egg to have an a plus rating with a bb\nAnd best they handles everything on line start to finish\nAnd consumer at their best steak five stars for the easy on line ... and we can be approved and funded and as little as one business day I applied on line with no impact my credit score\nJewish take credit for my witness but long story short she got an awesome loan you hate off our cards and some bills while lowering our monthly payment the best they loan was like a total fresh start yeah\nVisit best egg dot com slash blue best egg dot com slash blue subject acquitted approval actual Rich Beeson approval to actual very\nHigh on ... president and owner of indigo mortgage and we are your true locally owned and operated v a mortgage broker\nAs a broker we're ... many veterans get into homes with little or no money out of pocket this is done by lender credit it works like this\nA raiders consistently quarter to three quarters of a percent lower than other lenders and New Mexico if we just match the rate of other lenders we won't keep the profit on higher rate of return that money over to the veteran\nHe's lender credits can save the veteran thousands of dollars and clothes and cars there is no reason lenders be charging such high rates somebody a wild so I encourage all veterans looking to purchase or refinance to shop that mortgage around\nDon't take a higher rate if you don't need to and if you do let us pay your clothes and cars going to go mortgage and a three six five seven zero zero that's a three six by seven zero zero or on the net and indeed go mortgage dot net animal less when it eight three forty\nYears ago making\nA murderer became less a TV show than a force of nature and did uncover to raise the injustice in the criminal justice it was also completely\nDishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this ...

don't you started blaming you yeah so okay tossing those how I feel\nSo thank you for having me that\nA Republican strategist Rick Wilson whom we live just the best words\nOr does he definitely has the best words um he ripped on a morning show this morning apparently a Trump and called him a quote I have to say this red quivering blob of men baby of goods and says that uh his tweets Trump's tweet sound better than the original German\nThe fruit and we have to just go with it just brought up the tongue does it\nDoes is very difficult to say that now he's absolutely right he said I'm listening said they take\nThey retweet today which I'm sure sounded better in the original German and they're not taking in a sense sort of joking Trump isn't he said they take it as marching orders maybe only a tiny fraction of them but it only takes a tiny fraction of marching to a synagogue and kill eleven people and he's absolutely right\nI'll take a tiny fraction of them to like metal pipe bombs exactly to ... people\nAre I think twelve people for ... fourteen months twelve people have 'cause Maxine Waters got two and Joe Biden got to a yes on and then I'll probably be also found out the ... and ... and this is\nThe other thing with with Trump Tom Steyer yeah I mean literally the day after right no Senate two days after comfort hires\nSent a bon Trump calls him a craze and stumbling looted tech that's on helping\nSays he he tweeted just watched wacky Tom Steyer who I have not seen an action before being interviewed by Jake Tapper he comes off as a crazy\nStumbling lunatic who should be running out of money\nPretty soon well in in Trump's defense if ... if it would not put Tom Steyer on\nThis would have been a problem that is true you got to get ... yeah you can't put a critic of the president on right because it's it's it's because it's being to him now I understand yeah and and it's also the level of what ... what size that published that story\nI Believe it's having to bust their part of the problem too because they shouldn't publish a story\nThat talks about yeah because they're making a bigger than they are putting more of a spotlight on it\nOh it's about Trump's fault you just read it\nYou had to defend themselves oh no\nI've been doing this to all yeah I think Trump like do I don't I don't think Trump but I get the way he rationalize it you can translate Trump there 'cause that could bring Bob of man baby poop man maybe he is\nAbsolutely is and yet here he goes oh I think I read it never mind\n[laughter] I I oh here we have he treated of anger and outrage and we're out here it comes\nThere is a great anger in our country costs in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media he always capitalize is that mhm title yeah the ... enemy of the people also titled not stop and open the obvious\nHostility and report the news accurately they are in fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage also capitalized\nAnd it's and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must and they're reporting\nRight it's only like news if it's not supporting him\nNear leader and he just he he I shot helped me\nAnd we all say this and also to Saturday but\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] deep hostility\nAnd negative attacks you know the only served to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate okay there there\nWas no healthy debate in this country right now but you know and he's not promoting a healthy debate because everybody is his quote enemy right\nBecause if you disagree with him your ... your credit to your mouth through your article luckily mob\n... apparently yeah I don't know it's where am I a snowflake or and my\nMom she's the one who seems like a ... like if he's a very sensitive about these things he\nIs every touchy he's very touchy he ... he can't he's got the Senate he makes Sarah
