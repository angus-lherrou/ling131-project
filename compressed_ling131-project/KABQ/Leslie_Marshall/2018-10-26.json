{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Everybody [noise] mostly weekends [noise] hope you have plans\nAnd maybe your plans include democracy\n[noise] got a question a moment ago about whether or not the president to be indicted they were thinking in terms of the uh\nThe the ... bombing that the answer that question is almost certainly know that crying fire in a crowded theater\nIt still is a hard it's hard to prove causation so then if somebody gets trampled that it is the fault in a given person who calls ... who caused fires it's their fault that somebody gets injured but this was not even that even if you could prove that this was even further removed from that so I'm not going I don't want to\nGo that far but it does raise another question is can the president be indicted at all\nThere is a major debate so that question and if one agrees with all the little Holmes who says what a judge will do is all I mean by law\nThen you understand that the answer to the question of whether or not the president can be invited can be indicted is relatively similar to the question of\nShould Brett Kavanaugh beyond the Supreme Court\nBecause that question might well get the spring in court\nAnd Newt Gingrich said just this week with a yesterday\nAt well if there's a subpoena for Trump's tack record tax records then we'll find out\nIf the cabin I'll Fight was worth it\nCharles you got something to say about Fox News from ... Florida My locker\nDe la ... go ahead\nAnd forcing them and that's where some of the mill since ... when I was got it right um my my thing is though um basically I don't want us to go out\nAnd what I mean by that is because as a Democrat or in this climate and leadership um we haven't been taken advantage of opportunities that they would wander Verna if I ... in it\nFor them it's just the other day when they were when he when he burning out there among them and and I'm the kind of man or Middle Eastern\nAre going to carry around that and all that and then my first thing and I'm like well why\nIs this true more closely coming on and say well if they are I think you should go get them right now you know the answer to an American before dinner\nI'm In charge I appreciate I got to answer your question\nRelates to something that Tom says also the generally put too much agency we too but too much of our own us on elected officials to control what's happening in the media\nWhen with the exception of the president\nMost elected officials have relatively little purchase with what ends up\nOn TV and the radio and Internet feeds\nAnd so anytime I hear so I Wish the Democrats would just say black\nAlmost ... almost every time I can find a Democrat who did say that very thing but they say that a lot of people\nAre they tweeted it to a few thousand people or got retweeted some tens of thousands of people but not to millions and millions are repeated times\nThe other though is you raise a more specific questions why didn't in this instance is it OK well put up or shut up ... we think you're often\nWe don't think they're Muslims there if you think that there are terrorists they're Muslims are terrorists those are different things\nBut if you think they're criminals there go investigate part of the challenges that feeds the story\nThat if the if Trump gets to call the tune the bully pulpit of today is not the bully pulpit to talk all the time to be the first mover to garner the attention of the electronic hordes\nAnd we feed into it he says oh we we were spot everything he says sometimes you've got to sometimes we shouldn't\nAnd that's a question of judgment it's all going to be a hard decision to make those are my two answers to your good question I appreciate the Charles a mark the uh uh about the Supreme Court you're going to just about our last caller am I going to get somebody else go ahead\nYeah about the Supreme Court you know what are we going to hold the Supreme Court accountable for basically a be able to buy a politician us having a party that sold out the country and basically runs on hate and fear because it has nothing for the American people\nI appreciate it mark and let me just say this when are we going to host record accountable hell no I think there is going to be a more robust conversation around either expanding and don't say packing the court already got packed got backed by the Republicans over the last ten years so that twenty\nI think there will be a more robust conversation about expanding the court or adding term limits to the court about saying yeah lifetime appointment how about twelve years there's still a pretty well shielded and with no chance for re election so really all you're doing is trying to manifest your judgment\nTo make it a little bit\nLess political in that regard at least I think there will be a more robust discussion but it's one of the reasons why Nancy mclane wrote her book democracy and change\nIs it in fact the big move has been by John seek out home by James who cared about Koch brothers for not years or decades but more than a century\nIs to shackled democracy is to make sure the will of the people is limited\nBy strictures by the Supreme Court and has been only brief periods more in court for instance when the Supreme which happened to coincide with a lot of the dawn of the modern media age and it got really famous but it's only been brief periods where progressive change has happened because of courts\nProgressive change usually happens because of bigger pools of people not smaller rose but bigger rooms people engaging and operating and activating more and this is why I say that you're priceless\nThat you are the coalition of the ... irrational\nThe good people doing good things for no good reason\nWhat do we learn today we talked about legislative races we did get updates that ... has been arrested under suspicion for being the pipe bomber he had pictures of Donald Trump on his than\nWe did have a chance to talk about what's

does so between the three this morning bashing a CNN [noise] um the word is that he patently very annoyed that he's being blamed for the for the bombs\nSo he just tweeted Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the momentum greatly snows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans go out and vote\nWow\nWow and we've had our what twelve this morning Cory Booker and James Clapper being the last [noise] correct\nYeah there were up to bomb number twelve and my assessment is is that uh they'll target these individuals' then we have between Fifteen and twenty bumps probably inside the pipeline a you know some prominent Democrats have not yet received any there's a rumor that\nAh you know maybe there's one out there and Dianne Feinstein wrote but we haven't seen\nA Nancy Pelosi we haven't seen them with Warren we haven't seen some of the others and I'd like to call attention there's a group there is a political action committee called future forty five dot com that is running a commercial that I've been wondering about\nThat portrays progressives and Democrats in any you know Republicans who are opposed to Trump as dangerous violent gang and these ads are\nEverywhere everywhere I've been in the country I've seen these ads but every person who would set a bomb for the most part is in this that\nAnd you know I mean a missile Casio low a Cortez and and others so these people have a mindset of the terrorists have have a target listed in their head and fish individual went doubt it this is a serious serious bombing campaign that we're in right now\nNow come from the amount of bombs that we are talking about and what you just said do you feel like um it it is a group or do you feel like it's an individual\nIt feels like an individual who had a lot of time on his hands who to created a a bomb or a bomb assembly line yeah usually recalled these facilities any improvised explosive device facility a bomb factory\nAnd that's what I've been warning on television the last two days you know let's not get too caught up in the motivations of of this individual uh you know the targets that we have to we we can't ignore anymore but the motivation to the individual until we get him into we secure this bomb factories\nYou know just stuff may have been low grade explosives or but he intends these things to kill the individuals who opened up whether the mailman or or secretary at the GOP to secure it\nThank you that the press conference yesterday knock him he said the bomb squads have been treating the devices as live on and I I heard somebody make that very point that you know what are these poor postal workers that don't have Secret Service that don't have protection I mean you're right we've got to catch this guy\nOn these devices will blow up it killed the individual who opened they'll blow the fingers off they'll put shrapnel or to the states and to the chest there's washers in there there's broken glass\nAnd there are these things are designed to kill just because he's an amateur bomber and didn't do it very well doesn't mean that he that one of these won't go walk Jim Cavanaugh ATF agent who she was on TV with me all the time he says no viable Jim Cavanaugh tells me there viable there viable\nYeah I'm James Clapper said this morning he sees a clear pattern in the in the bomb threats he said anyone who was in publicly from needs to be an extra learn um\nBut that's the you know again you've been a counterterrorism expert for how long and this is the point of terror is you know and it it is interesting I texted yesterday's I'm sure everyone in the world the nose you did [laughter] asking because he you we start to get paranoid on our side right really cause is Russia Russia behind this is this a no no yeah but you\nKnow this is just as an American uh and this is someone in the United states who was taking the list that Trump has developed all this stuff and that you here and right when television and radio and they've weaponized it it's just simple as that there's no external factors here yeah\nWell I mean it is amazing because we obviously we have a conspiracy theorist in the oval office that this whole you know to senators on down or using this liberal hook thing like you know liberals are sending bombs to themselves I mean it's it's a ... it's extraordinary right Lou Dobbs Rush Limbaugh you name it\nYeah well ... junior ... percent yeah what'd you say\nWell first you got to read Trump's amazing tweet about bomb in quotes yes like it's not real yeah and this is dangerous we are in the middle of a terrorist bombing campaign I don't know how many devices are out there that puts me to panic mode\nTogether on Thursday Saudi

I guess what about the people from ... my name is Lou Dobbs would say\nJust emotional singles and Watergate attorney join mingle coming up on the Stephanie Miller shown\n[noise]\nImagine what it's like the active your whole life and then find out you're going blind I have aids related macular degeneration or AMD as a white mother and grandmother my site is precious to me so I was relieved to find the treatments for some forms of AMD are available and research for additional treatments is ...\nKomen Foundation fighting blindness today at one eight hundred blindness for free academic singer managing AMD or go to the website ... blindness dot org when I found so much helpful information called one eight hundred blind today\nFBI is arrested a suspect in the campaign that involve sending improvised explosive devices to several high profile individuals correspondence ... says fifty six year old Cesar ... was arrested in Florida\nIt to that this is all Republican ... mid term election ploy there are so many lies and let's call them what they are out there now about policy like the Republicans are going to protect preexisting conditions the Democrats are not going to\nThat's insane I mean all you have to do is look at how they vote and what policies there for you know a suggesting to know that that is not true and the same thing is true here they're trying to make Muller again look bad and the Republicans are saying that\nIt's all a big hoax yeah that it needs to be investigated and that\nThe investigation of Papadopoulos is a violation of his Fourth Amendment his right to um not be subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure when we know that he said to an Australian diplomat in London\nI Know that the Russians have these emails that's pretty good proof that he knew before anyone else knew and he told her to a totally\nUnbiased person\nAn Australian diplomat who had no reason to say anything other than the truth\nAnd so that there was a good reason for the FBI to investigate him based on how did he know this and why did he know this and who mould him so it seems to keep that his his involvement with the Russians it's pretty clear\nAnd there's nothing more to it than that and this just something that will be said so that the base of the Republican Party will except that these fraudulent statements are true will believe it and move voting according to the dead of saying wait a minute yeah\nAnd his team are threatening democracy they are risking national party and staying it's false things I'm yeah I Hope they will see it's the truth of it actually\nWill join a Newt Gingrich on cue heard just said um if you know Democrats win and they tried to subpoena his tax returns he said it'll go to the Supreme Court and then we'll find out if the Kavanaugh flight was worth it\nExactly which is well first of all they're like admitting that they're putting him into protect Trump right that\nAnybody who doubted that I'm surprised because it was pretty apparent I'm even before he said that I'm just surprised that he's not smart enough not to set it out loud yeah so it's clearly true\nYeah well so what do you think is happening with smaller I mean I guess there's some unwritten rule but not as close to the midterms but boy oh boy with everything happening and you don't you feel like while the American people really have a right to know as soon as possible\nSo I Do and it's it's sort of scary I mean an investigation has a life of its own and you have to let it go until it's done yeah and\nIt's it there is a time I mean let's face it call me did the wrong thing by interfering in the election by making an announcement first of all it was the wrong announcement he had to retract and he could have avoided the seconds announcement\nBy um enough FBI agents on it as soon as he learned about it ... this is going back to the um extra emails that he doesn't you know said oh wait there may be more and then you know like a week later said oh no there's nothing there they're all the same yeah um and\nCould've found out the answer before he announced it and said you know there's nothing here I I just I'm worried that if something comes out let's say there's an indictment a week after the election than most voters\nAre going to hopefully most voters are going to say why didn't I Know that before or write a voted and on the other hand if they did something the day before the election or the week before ... days before and\nWhoever is involved you know in in the indictments the Republicans are going to say this was putting their you know finger on the scales of justice and influencing the election\nAnd this will be false in court yeah wrong thing so there's sort of almost no good time when there is an election that says ... right on\nBut each in modeling I too close to the election here I mean it is mad right I mean it is troubling\nThe whole Kavanaugh thing obviously but I mean the fact that you may have someone on the court does not think a president can be investigated subpoenaed or indicted\nRight I mean I I feel like the ... I remember you see on TV I think we talk about this last time saying that you know you had to cancel ready to go against Nixon and then a Ford pardoned him and I just feel like if ... findings are what we think they are\nHow do you just let that no that's not political dirty tricks like Nixon that's treason isn't it\nIt it is I but I wouldn't say that anybody is going to let it go um I think that this will eventually the broad assuming that there is evidence that it will come to trial that it will you know him\nPresident as an uninvited co conspirator or if he\nWants to the rules and see if a president could be indicted and I do believe the constitution would allow that\nI don't know if it's the right thing to do at this time I think that impeachment would be a better approach or voting out of office a better approach but definitely there is something that needs to come out we need to have the facts America is entitled to the facts for sure\nYeah yeah absolutely I'm Jill I've selected to my mom's pin that I'm giving you it is\nA blue wave rock star pin oh\nOh I'm so honored and such a great family and this will be an honor to where\nOh I Am a listen we're going to get him tomorrow night in Chicago very exciting [laughter] ...\nSo I see I shouldn't wear a normal pin\nWhen do you can you know and now look we'll just see you could double yeah we all [laughter]\nI'm wearing a blue pin because I'm wearing blue pin yup now until the blue\nThere you go there you go there to be this week we're all run out of this week I better be November six yes an out of blue pin longest longest eleven days of our life our job for sure\nI I'm feeling good about it I really I ... I Believe America is going to let us down\nAt the what's going on and that the Democrats aren't motivated enough to get out there and the young people if you're listening this depends on you and your future depends on voting so please get out the vote\nYou you always make me feel better from the first time I saw you on TV you're very comforting and you're like I consider you my liberal mom so\n[laughter] I'll see you trying I'm trying to see you tomorrow night Joe thanks so much for the ...
