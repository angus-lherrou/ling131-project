... do you have new evidence use me do you have a question of ... one or two more questions waitress several questions don't do that does not identify somebody just before you excuse me don't do this\nDo you have a question on trade he went through several choir you have a question on trade my question is unjust at least shift you say\nWow he's so awful yeah yeah\nAnd okay we you know\nWhat we do need to hear any more about your stupid trade deal 'cause it's Obama's trade deal that you just put your name on\nYou more honest [noise] Tracey I Know when he was famous for giving a building in putting his own name on it\nTries to make it seem like you know this is some of course big win artist a\nDeal though I I I made a whole new deal I mean the\nVanity Fair mission accomplished Trump's new NAFTA deal is a lot like the old after this trade deals essentially a Rene brand of the old one I mean he is such a condom legit carnival Barker one more people get it\nFrom my MSNBC usher saying no this is actually freer trade\nBut after kissing off all our allies and for what they are just bring he does this with everything anyway in the first thing a\nWhile he's yet to strike newer better alternatives for the Iran deal or TPP or is this one I guess you know it's I don't even know it's something unpronounceable that he's now renamed it and they said the contentious ugly seemingly endless rounds of negotiations or the Neal the new agreement is\nWait for it extremely similar to the old agreement mhm um\nYeah the ah it Canada will open up its dairy market to more American products but as the New Republic points out the opening is similar to what the us would have gained through the TPP to wit TPP would have opened up three point five percent of the Canadian dairy market while the new agreement will give the the us access to three point six\n... meaning so this small concession ... at the God\nTrumps noon after the one he wrecked diplomatic relations with Canada and roiled current currency markets in order to secure is basically Obama's TBB with Obama's name paper it over by a gilded Trump sticker um this is according to experts this isn't me this is a bunch of different and they're not and liberal publications\nUm the reality is that America is expended a tremendous amount of national political capital pretty modest changes President Trump has claimed that NAFTA at one point oh was the first worst trade deal in us history and helped make America poor country is so that it's hard to see how NAFTA two point oh changes that status quo or is it now or just a really bad trade deal\nI mean yeah luckily Trump will undoubtedly be using this quote unquote victory as an excuse to hit other countries with more tariffs after all the patent deterrent process worked exactly as planned if not advertise discard an Obama era agreement\nA trash or allies causes much economic dysfunction as possible insult your counterparts terrify Wall Street than dust off the hold agreement with a few small tweaks mission accomplished without terrorists we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those that he said uh just for those babies out there to keep talking about tariffs\nSo we call people that think therapy or a bad idea baby baby [noise] but [noise]\nBut that's right that it really is true it's almost like everything any policy rip up whatever
