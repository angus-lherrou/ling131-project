I may paraphrase just feel compassion and tied one else right it in my face and I'm looking for someone to help me like this that I that quarter of a book already that there was a mutation\nBack in middle Asian middle Eurasia someplace that created here in the heart because they were unable to steal spirit unable to feel connected to the land on April ... next to each other and therefore unable to steal\nEmpathy and compassion and this became the conquering Jean [noise] excuse me they crossed the world\nAnd that it is most prevalent in conquering across Europe but that and then it shows up into farms now\nThe dominant aggressive gene in the ...\nThe ... is when we get damaged we wounded I'm I'm Thomas somehow we lose the ability to feel compassion and then we become angry and we start lashing out and we can see it's just one of each yes eat\nRight and we can look at Trump and see his PTA how his father I've heard stories I Know somebody can those coke stories of how cooks father treated him and then what happens is that it becomes damaged need unable to steal\nI'm not only empathy but also\nThat there's not unable to be aware of the abundance\nIn a first and so it is the root uh hind all this evidence and I had at least when he entered greed it's under it's always about not enough trying to build this and the whole deep him and that and we can see this how we can change because of how we've seen\n'em for example young men leaves the alt right movement who have an open to compassion\nBy that are he has that aside genetic that it's cultural\nI think it's both\nI think the culture triggers the recessive forum at this gene that cannot steal God this is why have I'm an atheist\nAlthough you know it's not that just like you know a component of human nature that that you know we all have the capacity to be\nTo be compassionate we all have the capacity of the violent we all have you know that that spectrum of behavior is available to us than the way that we are brought up and the culture in which were brought up is going to you know bring one or the other to the fore\nI Would say that there has been generally enough blood mixing that that is generally true but if you look at certain tried you'll find that it's about killing\nThat didn't happen until there is leading family line ... um there's a fascinating book that looks at how spirits and now I happen

day step by step and every day the the\nThe heat gets a little bit hotter on our side over yeah\nYeah and not come as you've pointed out and about the Saudi thing he has been line from day one what do\nThey just ask them yesterday is he dead he's like well it certainly looks that way he knows he's dead\nYeah she wouldn't believe any U.S intelligence until my palm hail came back and told\nAnd look listen we are talking about this yesterday or the day before we our ouch standing in technical intelligence yeah I mean let me tell you if we didn't have a copy of that than we certainly had a description\nOf it from first to your sources yeah uh well before it got into the media were that good but Mike Pompeo Donald Trump they've got this little game going on there you know uh and they are providing cover for the Saudi Government\nAnd now once Pompeo came back and reported this stuff is real\nYou know all the reporter you've been seeing from the CIA ... for the last two weeks it's real only than Donald Trump says okay well we'll see if we can do with it you know what's gonna happen nothing they are going to allow them to investigate\nOpen worker's exploited deep disappointment knock them oh what did it was at a company with thoughts and prayers but yeah yeah yeah and it's great yeah they've cut off or intelligence right he did they canceled a meeting to share intelligence of the Senate of course because he said it's not a pretty picture you know Saudi Arabia\nStephanie ... this little oh this deliberate piece of performance art keeps unraveling because sources keep undermining the position was reporting yesterday they pay late for him they played for him right when he was out there the actual audio of the murder and the torture taking place of the show yeah\nYeah knock him I Know you've got a stronger stomach having been\nIn the intelligence business but uh yeah this is horrifying I mean it's just the more details that come out I mean not only about\n... you know being tortured with the you know defected basically while he was alive for seven minutes then beheaded ... you know the detail yesterday was that he was sedated at a certain point so that he could still be conscious derived but not screened\nI'm sure that they should uh you know I ran the terrorism hostage survival school yeah oh for four years of this uh dated him in the first moments just to get 'em compliant but aware\nAnd ah then at that point they wanted him to suffer it and they ended it most likely ended it with a ritual is the ceremonial beheading\nWhich is what they do but none of this is not sanctioned by the crown prince it cannot happen all of those aircraft that moved there were from the royal light yeah okay that's like the air force one stable\nAll the people who were there were the equivalent of his immediate Secret Service detail you know there had the guy um\nYou know that one guy is the key ... he's the Saudi Keith Schiller to Saudi\nKeith show are only more importantly he would be the equivalent of the supervisor of the oval office security and uh and special\nOr says pilots and then this guy was a famous famous forensic pathologist in Saudi Arabia who is known for his for processing the dead who were killed at mecca\nDuring stampede Z and and you know in in incidents where people die by the hundreds sometimes during the hostage\nAnd this guy created a mobile forensics laboratory a multi million dollar mobile forensics laboratory in mecca there's documentaries showing this ban yeah discuss how he has bought forensic science back there she's on the plane with the special forces and oil guard guys\nAnd he's in the room with bones saw yeah\nAs you do when you go to a a interrogation\nI'm Scott work in our front waited Trump is complicit in assassination think about that he is helping the Saudis cover up the assassination of a U.S resident resident ... show the he's known 'cause yesterday was dead since the story broke lied to the world about Trump is the biggest threat to our national security um because someone else wrote that Malcolm is like\nWhat is this open the door to now what next because they ... obviously the world knows you can a via off Donald Trump that he has you know no moral core of any kind\nOf oh I've been saying that for for a long time that the Saudis when he went to his trip to Saudi Arabia uh up until this point us presidents were immune\nImmune to their charms over there and they're ... the way that they do businesses they offer you caught you on any deal and when I didn't do that in Iraq people were dumbfounded they couldn't understand me yeah you know because I'm an American Donald Trump is a player he came into that casino\nReady to take whatever kickbacks they offered ready to take whatever sweetheart deals facilitate Asian of of Jared Kushner's a debt all of that and I think this is a new facet of of of corruption that that that I was just in the Albert Mohler is gonna really is going to go to out\nYeah I was going to say that for not only say this every morning right\nThis is almost the most ... what's the word but we'll during array this morning of the indicted both fences criminal behavior corruption between the pro public story about how the Trump family's business model has been fraught and\nThis is a memorial for this is the most corrupt administrators American history period and that will stop the FBI from moving their headquarters so because of this stupid hotel which he shouldn't be the first place there's another advantage I mean the ... the fact that the Saudis have bought him off basically I mean I just\nBut you know it's dangerous about this moment as all of that stuff comes out as you talk about Stephanie it it's done against the backdrop of Seventeen Days Eighteen days away yeah\nIf they hold on to the Congress they are going to say all of this was out there the American people don't care right they made a referendum vote on what they want and it's we're now it's time to go to town\nWhile putting sticking a victory lap lawyer who where I get a victory yeah that's right and you set it up for ... to remember the sixth feeling the morning after twenty sixteen election when you second guess yourself and ask what else you could have done to ... prevent Trump's victory you better be asking yourself

giant traders are yeah oh that trolls outside the courthouse yeah that that guy's that American you yeah\nI was hearing someone the other day talking about whoever wrote the New York times you know anonymous thing they're like well you know that really kind of as treason and I'm like well so if you commit treason against the trader what kind of is a\nIs there some kind of noble [laughter] three hundred by trees maybe you'd already a triggering you committed like us oh All right I'm All right so off or not you were saying\nAbout uh uh uh what do you call it that we were talking about smaller well first of all your take on Rosen steam and the comments he made because we're all nervous right you know you obviously was defending the investigation but you're like is he fired right after the you know the midterms in ... what was your take on all that\nWell look I mean I think the fact that Rosenstein still has a job is a is a tremendous thing for this country I'm shocked that he's still there yeah I thought they were going to use the um the leak if you will of the time stories the pretext to get rid of him\nBut fundamentally I think Trump knows what's going on you saw Don McGahn out also the general Katz yesterday yesterday was his last day on the gig yeah after we learned hundreds of ours was the term\nOf cooperation Manafort who was reported a couple of days ago yeah he's had dozens of hours with the special counsel's office something is clearly rumbling something is clearly cooking and as I said earlier I think those indictments or an ice and the question is how quickly Stephanie after the election\nDo does the report came out and does it start to leak into the into the mainstream yeah because\nIf I got nervous than the two months even if there's a huge blue wave like that a couple of month period before we actually take power right\nOh yeah a lot of mischief can happen in that period of time but I suspect Fernandez right I think there there is\nOne piece of this puzzle which we we all spoken and written about several times in his room\nBut what I call the bridge has not yet been lately uh done a five and that's the bridge between wiki leaks and the Trump campaign which is essentially the Russians and the Trump chemical\nThat is that why that's where men if they're talking to Manafort about his connection to stone in about ... can I just I just\nKnow more and you know ... you know it's a joke over in Mueller's team\nThat every morning they pick up the phone and they go get me Roger Stone is all a break out of the laughter is like yeah they're going to get that guy is going to be fun [laughter]\nCooking at some active measures okay that's how we\nDo it behind closed doors are always be joke\nUm okay uh once again for non two weeks or three

intellectual inspiration for Malcolm ants because as Malcolm has learned in the work he's done overseas\nWhat these governments that are trying to flip a system you're more than anything is a popular peaceful uprising national mobilization\nAnd that's why we're talking in only asking you were not asking you to put the uniform on and go put your life on the line where blue where an American flag and just be out there show that there are safety in numbers and there are millions tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of us Stephanie that don't want this to happen and if you if\nYou are now in history yeah and if you don't have enough to motivate you the fat the\nPollutant is right now openly taunting us that America has done ... American influence is over I show him exactly what Malcolm says in his book this is what is most afraid of ... and he actually warning Trump about right now is the ... and uprising like this all the

tell what the heck America [noise] lots of destroyed democracy\nA jet right you should all be reading block the destroyed democracy if you want to know how bad is going to get that yeah they've done this in Europe\nYeah [noise] oh okay so but you had tweeted early on bigger story U.S intelligence has special flash communications reporting network designed to inform the president of critical intelligence within five minutes of recognition\nOr a Trump has been lying to us about because she'll be since day one and he still is usually found hammer yesterday oh well I don't think that it looks maybe\nUsually five minutes a maximum of ten minutes from the moment of recognition yeah show on the day that ... a disappeared in that embassy that would not have been that level of reporting but the moment\nThat the Turks came out and said that he was killed or we would have used our own intelligence in that flash traffic would have gone straight to the president was out stop yeah it it must be put before the president and brief that was the first day it's been two weeks now yeah he really much has been like\nThe way I've been pointing out here for a lot about the Saudi arms deal on top of it is not a hundred and ten billion dollar deal right now it stands at fourteen point five billion\nA while he is personally ... millions of dollars in Saudi business where am I reading from um he's exaggerating by seven hundred percent the value of us weapons sale to Saudi Arabia\nUm he said a hundred and ten billion with the military the biggest ordering these three of the world like everything's what he has to lie about everything and everything in reality only fourteen point five million a weapon sales have been approved\nBy the Trump Administration or in a ... this is a case where conflicts of interest can kill said Walter shop the autocrats in the world are watching what the United States does nest next to nothing happens what's next in American citizen gets murder broad dissidents in exile get killed on American soil\nYes and that happened a lot\nUnder Moammar Gadhafi he would send out hit teams to murdered his dissidents overseas and I think the Saudis just thought hey we can do that now\nDonald Trump is not going to do anything don't trumped himself said this the other day\nI Believe he's the Saudis citizen no I Believe he's a permanent us residents bumped Virginia yeah who works in washing Washington Post reporter yeah we usually an American citizens by the way we dispatch ... we'd dispatch cheer one special operations people to rescue\nPeople of that status just roaming will allow him to be murdered\nYeah when they first asked me 'cause I don't believe us citizens like it doesn't matter that is a guy just got killed with the bones to offer ... ... okay I just did okay I can I Max Boot ... former lifelong Republican of course I'm Talking about this\nIt's going to be a long wait if they're looking for a serious investigation I'm asking the Saudis to investigate to mark his shoulders murder\nThere's kind of like asking Donald Trump junior to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign on the Russians the only way you're going to get a fair and impartial investigation as to how it'd be done from the outside I mean the Saudis are not going to implicate the crown prince who's in charge of the entire state\nWhich by the way he went on to say that someone asked\nYou got to look for somebody to take the fall and it's very disturbing when the Washington Post is reporting that the Trump Administration seems to be colluding with the Saudis and trying to come up with a cover story for this murder instead of trying to get out the truth\nSo that's the latest theory right knock them is that they're going to try to pin this on I forget his name but there's name is colonel in the major general McClellan sorry right and so they're going to say that he could have order he's high up enough he could have ordered this without the print knowing what I ...\nYeah he's deputy he's deputy commander of Saudi intelligence uh he was the person who reportedly had proposed\nThe uh the away teams that tiger teams which we're supposed to track down dissidents against the regime particularly ... that according to the Washington Post which were ordered U.S intelligence\nFound that information out and none of that could have been done without the crown princes personal authorization again they were using aircraft from the royal flight that is like the air force while we\nMaybe you said a lot of it you tweeted about a picture of this guy you said he's the Saudi keeps Schiller reason or the camera images show him at\nYou know we have to cram prints I mean almost ... that's my ...\nAnd she is the guy who goes around with him he appears to be the supervisor of the crown prince is personal security detail yeah he stands in the uh\nAdvantage to images at the in Turkey is what I'm saying well yeah and the outcomes\nConsidered the one where he's the leader of this this is ... yeah um which tells you it's personal\nWe talked about this whole family I mean how disgusting this reporting on Jared Kushner urging the president stick by the Saudi prince whose is bud and he said a cushion or argue that the outrage over a to show these disappearance unless they keep calling it a disappearance\nOkay experts BP and the number one VPN
