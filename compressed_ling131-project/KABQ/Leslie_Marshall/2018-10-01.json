never obey all the other things we never would have even thought of but it'd be something something words words I'm going to guess but with everything will be fine on all of a very long\n... okay [noise] okay and he went on to say\nActually this could be a blessing in disguise because having the FBI\nTo a thorough investigation yes very thoroughly three days or seven days I think it's good to be less than a week but I\nInvestigation I actually think will be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing ...\nYes for you all New York times reporting that it could be over today that's how thorough it is okay oh and one last one frankly\nThe FBI has a chance to reveal a lot of different things I'd like\nOut who leads the debate was deserted advised involved that's the real certainly her body language was not exactly very good\nOh okay\nLike defines yes as part of it\nOnly the papers which demographic plead the ...\nReally oh so you know for sure before the investigation it was a Democrat and were investigating Dianne Feinstein body language\nThat's the real crime not that you nominate a rapist to the Supreme Court die and find you didn't like her body language well thank God the FBI is going to be on that that we're going to get that body language experts from Fox News [noise]\nWhich Democrat\nRelief to the Republican operative yeah for the Republican operative was the

time\nThat's that's ridiculous [noise] you know they're they're saying why did she why Feinstein or being leak\nThis yes and then they say why didn't really could Souter right there there\nBecause she knows how did it and leaked it and that's at the same time\nAnd the waters of virtually boiling\nYes exactly exactly and we're officially frogs a hinder close you are talking about the uh narrowness of the FBI so\nWell based on some of the reports are that we've seen this weekend I'm very concerned about this because the White House should not be allowed to micromanage an FBI investigation she said they're not ... they're not\nI Know kill and there was one thing she didn't say and that is at the hard working men and women in the FBI should be able to do their jobs and on that I agree\nI'm Sorry is anyone offering but Kelly and said as a just this proves that it must be true okay and\nWhat we're hearing are reports that there's somehow trying to limit this or to a few witness says or tell them what they should do and while the White House\nDecides who they nominate and then that person is submitted to a background check I've never heard that the White House either under this president or other presidents as saying when you can interview this person you can't look at this time period you can only look at these people from one side of the street from when they were growing up I mean come on is there evidence that it is [noise]\nPolitical building that dream [noise]\nWe'll make promises big tested over time in distance [noise] tried by circumstances and decisions

Tapper yesterday correct\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment and rate\nThat [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I'm a victim of sexual thought I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody can be held responsible for that I think it's unfair own conduct\nOkay we talked about this earlier this I I Know we believe women\nI'm just saying I'm not even gonna question well I Know of course now I'm just I'm I'm going to question the way she handled though right I just wearing but that was the weirdest\nThing to make that can you know that confession but then blame women in the same breath you're responsible for your own behavior I I don't know what she's saying she's like oh did I watch\nA movie that I was ... responsible for what happened to her like for instance if this is obviously the main allegation we're talking about okay\nLet's just be honest and they said well it's for all partisan politics all women can't you know I Want those women who have who wish to actually talk to us in fighting Jeff Flake God Bless them but I don't blame the purpose\nOf cancer because that's what was the actual thought the people who commit the first time this is the first time I've ever heard you talk about something personal like that and I'm really sorry I just I just had it I Know but I'm really not arguing with what what\nOkay I'm\nOnce again they have every right to confront jak like about being one of the people that it's going to put\nA sexual assailant on the Supreme Court or the United states for life and board there I mean I'm not ... lake for their sexual assault no it's just such a weird an argument makes whales you as something that happened to you too\nYou know I\nI don't buy the way ... is trying to make us right right now that's what she's accusing Kavanaugh this yeah\nOK you worked for a president who says it all the women who accused him or wind or there'd been a number of people\nAnd don't complete that with this and certainly don't get laid it with what happened to me\nCan you know I don't know what I'm not ... we're not going to say well that's\nNot always brings Trump and everything\nHas ever I sat for if they want\nIs that not fair to go you completely relevant ... right represent a man who has been credibly accused by not one to ... ... what are we Nineteen stripped last week and said you\nBelieve him because it made but it's actually a little older\nAnd right on the Access Hollywood tape yeah\nOkay I don't that okay I'm not saying I just believe it just it it is amazing the lengths they will go to to try to protect this president and now his rapists nominee yeah at our biggest player was but you said it's all about Trump it's all about from\nReally without a sexual predator has nominated another sexual predator to the Supreme Court yeah you can get it all relevant um my new spirit senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii\nBut right now what we need to focus on and our\nAbility as senator and do our advice and consent job to determine whether judge Kavanaugh is credible whether he was candid with us whether his demeanor by the way and and uh\nAccusing Democrats or some kind of a conspiracy to do him in as a ... so bizarre\nYeah I'll say a buddy in Columbus hello buddy hey mom I happy birthday thank you\n... ... there was something the FBI has been told by the White House they cannot interview Julie sweat Nick right she she is number three she's highly credible and yet they're trying\nAnd by the way would lose her entire livelihood if she had lived she's lied\nAnd judges girlfriend has verified that these types of things happen he admitted that those types of things happen right\nKey cold she has held are still hold seven top level security clearances yeah she's highly credible chicken put Kavanaugh at the party can put him in his in his buddies on lines outside doors to molest girls and all that other stuff\nYeah please don't tell me doing this investigation knock it away and one thing real quick last week\nKavanaugh said this is a here if you ask any of the witnesses they'll say I wasn't there I have a witness to something that that didn't happen\nYeah yeah I mean please exactly I you know try to ... I've got I don't know about you but I've got friends I mean triggered all over the place in many ways a friend of mine the witness one not in the room it but at college witnessed a bunch of guys in her dorm\nYou know wind up at the RAs room so it was alright the resident it was happening in the resident advisors room um but she saw the door open and the girl was drunk and she was from a different college was drunk and making the guy on top of her and she to this day is blames herself she's like she didn't have the tool box at that time and do what was happening and what she was supposed to do\nYou do notice do afterwards yeah but I had a thing is\nFor yourself because you're putting yourself at risk if especially if you're a single ... she saw you know years later she got a group\nEmail he was being honored for something you know for that and that's the thing is like all this crap about you can't go to jail or you can't you know anyway okay alright Mazie Hirono again\nEven as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated are being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nYeah and then one more ...\nThe thing is that every Senate vote matters and there's a there's time to get to the bottom of it even if it's seven days that's bad enough but then to limit the FBI as to the scope and who they're going to a question that is that really ah [laughter]\nI wanted to use the word farce but ah [noise] and that's not the kind of investigation and all of us are are expecting the FBI to conduct\nHey Dan you're on the Stephanie Miller show\nHigh high\nHigh um I guess one of the country um\nWhen I was violently sexually assaulted I Will never the same things you remember\nI remember that I thought I Would find it die that they would never get born and I remember who of course yeah\nYeah you can't say you believe Dr Ford but but you don't think Brett Kavanaugh did it that that is not that the you know that's not possible no game and is that the our ... live in Studio with us next\n[noise]\nAnd we need a place that could make it home\nFrom diabetes prevention to safety around water the why does the gap in fact has already ...\nUs as a foundation in the future us as a bond\nBut right now they're buying spree do without\nCars where there's a lot [noise] there's enough\nThe why for better or [noise]\nWe'll make promises the pledge allegiance to the floor\nOf the United states of America\nI Do solemnly swear to help you\nTo me as caring loving\nOr most of them come in order nation's veterans are no veteran going through a difficult time budgeting make the connection\nAnd talk aims Thirteen fifty ... is available everywhere you want to listen on our free I honestly the last\nSenator to break new trade deal I'm Mike moss the full Senate has begun consideration\nAbout whether to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite an ongoing FBI investigation into sexual assault charges against the nominee Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the vote will be held this week you listen\nTops of her hair out and then raped her in a rage and then she retracted it later when they were doing their financial settlement but I I don't think you just make something like that up now that and then say isn't it I tried to hundred what she tried to say that oh I didn't mean it you know literally\nThat he raped me or I'm like really is there another way to say that angered about K\n... a still a lot they'll sue how do you do\nPay them wanting everybody who now\nSee I think that men don't get paid a researcher act question\nThe question was what you do keep yourself safe from assault sexual in otherwise and then instead to a person I don't really think about it\nAnd when that um I like ... and I carry my cell phone and our job at night at like the windows when I go out and make sure my drink is served it all the time I don't get on the wrong man a man alone I don't the rest area are\nOn and on and on and it's the men and that leads some women don't and then that women always feel vulnerable women are only thinking we teach our girls how do you keep yourself safe\nI'll let you in your community right driving if they don't get that I Can't help them but I Will vote them out\nAnd the London artist that came out yesterday was an article that said that we the voters men and women are watching and that every Republican centered in both confirms is completely on that guy deserved to be they will not vote for them and I can only hope that's true\nYeah so I was talking the first hour about you know a couple of guy friends of mine um and I I just not being a parent\nI sort of shocked that to it all parents don't teach their sons as as you know one listener of mine said to be protectors of women and not predators\nI mean these two friends of mine both had stories independently in College of helping them ... woman the got really drunk and passed out and ... to get home safely and take her shoes off and put her to bed not to rape her I mean\nReally very simple okay no means no consent is your responsibility to gang in a sense and now that you know we've raised his son we have a grandson\nNow that one of ... stadium consent me what do you know it doesn't matter if in the middle of yes she said you know yeah I mean what can I just\nI don't think we have this idea to start a thank you movement in addition to the me to do the good guys you because I go and look I sue I get a lot of dumb stuff we all did you know in high school and college involving drinking in situations that I you know I shouldn't have put myself in but you know one and I get that I'm probably lucky but no guy ever\nDidn't stop when I said stop but every everyone\nHas to be remembering this isn't about sex it's about power yeah that\nIt's about humiliation it's about this this through line of them doing it for other guys entertainment and they're laughing you know like\nThis case it can I just had three ... two things uh two best for\nFed if an added vocabulary Brett Kavanaugh you're wildly he was either ... or he was having a man from it was really I\nHave to think through nano cause now yeah I honestly ... everything that out everything he did would be described if a woman had that and I know\nI Know I mean ... ... and you just can be trusted to eleven and a half hours of Hillary Clinton right right not crying not not screaming not interrupting right\nOh yeah yeah right and I've heard one other thing I Want to give some advice and attorney on Twitter again for whatever like when my goals and who I trust implicitly with his legal advice and I love when polls show they're saying that you get the FBI you don't have to rely on them you every state has a\nAttorney general for the federal government we have a U.S government you know from the department of justice in Maryland is a guy named Robert her you can contact that off and file a complaint about perjury we now have an ally repeatedly repeatedly\nHe lied yeah everything from the drinking age in Maryland to the mis delivered misinterpretation of you know of sex terms of course it out you know being being a legacy yeah\nAnd you know this July first thing on his stupid calendar is so interesting because you know send went to wherever for you know for Bruce ... right with all the people the doctor for name someone made a great point so they said how would ... identified by name to Kavanaugh's closest friends if she didn't know where we're headed\nBarely met him I mean and then and then after that series of questions that included the July first question she never got speak again the uh Mitchell right I\nAm hoping I can only hope that uh well of course not once once they were done hiding the opposite of drilling a woman had evaporated they didn't meet her anymore and it was literally had to do his vapors thing you know I mean that was right\nWell they obviously losing on the law and on the optics and they're like okay time to you know a few political a fit right\nAdam well again every single one of them there's Pete my question is you pledge you know the ... or you pledge you know Donald Trump because obviously they have ...\nYou know he's the Merck house in dance all living in Alaska there from the lieutenant governor citizens who are they supposed to represent all state not from this man and yet I bet they vote will um\nAnd I I mean but you know that's a disgrace I mean you've got to know as women ... how do you watch ... watched the did you do you watch a lot of it but how I how do you watch out for you know she's telling the truth right I mean and the only dispute we've had the here is is\nWas Brett Kavanaugh so blackout drunk he doesn't remember it and I have to I had was lying about it I have to imagine he does you know I mean it's like again alcohol doesn't make you a rapist alcohol doesn't make you racist that's got to be in you you know what I mean it's like Mel Gibson or whoever blaming alcohol\nPreviews also saying I don't know this girl so she wouldn't stand out to him\nOut of probably ... many women he did this to yeah you know she wouldn't stand out as anything other than oh she was a cute blonde girl that I tried to do this too so that wouldn't be special to him and wouldn't stand up for them because you\nYou do you remember those loving people in the face I knew he remembers I ... I\nLook we've all had too much to drink and forgotten stuff we set our conversations but not physically assaulted them when it was just so\n... that it is white and his wife continue just admitted okay you know what I write a lot sometimes they I blacked out I didn't do that yeah you know maybe I thought I was high angle is about ... ... it was you know\nMaybe I thought I was horsing around but you know now as an adult I realized that I traumatized her and I'm so sorry but there are ways to\nHandle this but we're not seeing what he did was okay but he could have handled it\nYeah but I think that's that's what goes to his guilt beyond this purpose I think this doesn't happen one time\nI mean I'm Sorry the chances are he completed rapes the fact that this one he didn't because he was too drunk based on what we know based on old everybody else's testimony and Ramirez she'd do that this was a pattern of behavior this wasn't a one time Dr foreign hopefully in this limited scope\nI mean whatever the market to you got to keep the pressure up we just you and I have to hope that mark judges at the whatever step it isn't a twelve steps [noise] 'cause he was ready to [noise] what's that stuff [noise] I haven't gone to any of them yet you know make the marriage\nRight where he's a Democrat or narrowly inventory that thing where he's right you know more about the ...
