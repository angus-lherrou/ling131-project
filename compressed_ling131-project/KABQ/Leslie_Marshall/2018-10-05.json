camera news why ... why she's about\n... when he was\nPicking up your phone calls and Paul and wouldn't they'll washing hey Paul what's on your mind\nWhen you started to mention a little bit about my topic is what is to become of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich allegations of sexual assault allegation\nYeah okay and uh\nYou know we have to look at this at least the senators talked to this is not a matter of beyond a reasonable doubt it's not even a matter of preponderance of evidence it's a matter of sufficient doubt the fishing down as in playing Russian roulette\nRussian roulette is one in six or one in eight no one would do that right right talking percentages that are very low uh and I would say that regardless of Christine Blasey Ford's F my legal set that aside his own testimony left plenty of doubt yeah\nWhich is why the NBA has reopened their inquiry into whether is downgrade to merely qualified status should be drawn downgraded further\nAnd twenty five hundred law professors yeah\nThat was signed an open letter against his is a domination or I guess his uh his confirmation and twenty five hundred by the way this was on another program a is a Fifteen Percent of all the law professors in the country 'cause there's only about Seventeen thousand of a\nWhile I was wondering I was wondering about the context that's fascinating\nBut this is what I Want to talk about why after I think what's to become this\nThere's an article in the national review it says well you remember the book Harper leads to kill a mocking bird or a black man was accused of raping a white woman right and the movie Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch who successfully defended the black man they're saying\nIf if we ... it is in this context Atticus Finch would be raped and I are so they're playing racism against sexual assault\nWell this is this is my point in my first hour ramp Paul where I I I was going off on you know you've got four different Fox hosts now who have said that this is all because Kavanaugh as a white man\nAnd and so ah okay who's going after the white man well there's only two people of color on the Judiciary Committee about Democrats won demand Wonder Woman Cory Booker income all Harris is that what they're saying you know I haven't been watching Fox News so I don't know if they're showing you know a black senators when they say this\nBut you know racialized in this is insane\nWell let's look at an email we essentially left are hung out to dry yeah\nWhen we're in control of that sound at the time and so what happened then it was race played against sexual harassment\nYeah Joe Biden has apologized to put a black\nOn the court because a black man just died left the court though so it it's insane and this is what we have I I'm very frustrated time because we have\nA white woman being a ... a alleging sexual assault against the blind to fucking sexual assault when you when you count him covering her airway that's just plain first degree felony assault right but we have this this is these are two white people and fifty three percent of white women voted for Trump\nI don't know how to advocate for women for women when that's what happened fifty three percent is not the women do kind of white women women obviously the majority of women that but that was made up by women of color\nThere was only three percent of black when I voted for Trump as I recall and and and and this was by the way Paul and then let's you know reminding each other in our audience this was after the Access Hollywood tape came out in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by their crotch\nAnd and uh you know bragged about sexual assault and said you know when you're a star they let you do it at cetera et cetera I mean this is this is widely\nAnd so are we going to leave leave Christine Blasey Ford hung out to dry\nThe only way it sure looks to me to continue this investigation these allegations is for enough people to get off of their smitty whatever and started voting and if we can take control of the house of representatives then they can open up hearing cetera\nContinue looking into this but otherwise this is ... and we're going to be in the same as it should not be happening twenty seven years after Clarence Thomas\nWhile I don't remember may you know after ... class Thomas's put on the court um and again Democrats control Congress there was no follow up on those hearings\nAnd right you know ... and Dan Jane ... happen and the other thing is uh you know\nBlack people are being subject every sort of is mostly black being shot while I'm On black black folk in very small number\nThat you know part of that is the is the legacy of Jim Crow\nYeah we all need to the young people voting you know basically the only minority group the Trump wants to go after the vote heavily or are older people and even there he's surprised at the mall thanks a lot of people are always good to hear from you it's fifty seven anyway and he says that home the end of the show\nThat he thought we'd have another hour\nOr so much for being with me that I Hope you have a great weekend ... comfortable weekend don't forget
