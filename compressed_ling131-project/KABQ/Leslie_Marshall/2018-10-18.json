obviously a lot you're not the only prominent Republican that is a you know whenever you want to call yourself right it never Trump or but\nFrankly I think speaking in some cases with more passion and urgency then I hear some people on our side speaking because I I feel like you see not just your country but your party going up in flames um where did you come from to get here\nOr there gets right a lot of the you know it's always the case right or something you were part of\nStarts to go down the tubes are blows up your care more about it in a way that the people who are always been different or maybe even hostile to that that outside of the equation I think everyone should be comparable to get this good for the country to have to you know reasonably healthy political parties where the differences are within certain bounds of\nYou know accepting the norms of liberal democracy the institutions or you know try to have a civil civilized debate about policy it gets pretty heated sometimes but but\nReally Trump takes the Republican Party in a very different direction there I think it's bad effect for Republicans or conservatives but really for the country because Democrats are what every election and you don't want the alternative partner to be something that's\nReally nativist and authoritarian and with very little or no regard for basic norms and\nCurtis the ... the liberal democracy\nYeah well I agree with Max Boot another conservative writer ... version of the Republican Party needs to be burned to the ground so from the ashes we can build a decent center right party in America again I mean bill you probably know my dad ran with ... speaking of lifelong Republicans and was chairman of the Republican Party right I just don't\nI I I don't think they would recognize that this isn't a Republican Party is it this is Trump ism this is this is a cult of some sort\nOf that is both ... sort of willing to switch positions on things just because of what Trump says that also\nYou know for the popular foods that are public in a way that a little hard to have any one of our dogs need and hurt anyone obviously it's a democracy and but I'm the degree to which I mean just Trump's appeal to bigotry\nOr the kind of shame with of it it's one thing to have every party has a you know an attractive elements than people who go over the line and so forth are both sides but this is that the president of the United states the leader of the party the president country do this right now he's tweeting about this caravan of migrants\nComing out four thousand people coming up from Honduras or whatever the right policy is in charge of stopping them or not stopping more which one do you stop or how that yeah you know ... or questions at the border and so forth that's pure appeal to date of as\nA demagoguery election issued a lot of talk about health care less about talk about that if I talk about foreign policy let's just get everyone alarmed four thousand people may or may not come into the United states yeah\nBecause there were three\nBecause it was on Fox and friends I mean it it's just it's absurd I you know bill and I I my listeners are probably tired of this but my dad was a prosecutor Nunberg and I just I\nI I I thought we not these are bad I thought we had that was like a settled thing here I mean when when I when we all ... all the things we've seen when we looked looked at Charlottesville and we looked at it Helsinki I mean it just\nIt it it is and now the Saudi Arabian thing bill you tweeted Trump isn't being played or con by the Saudis Trump is very much in on the ... in the house of Trump in the house of song or collaborators in the cover up\nThat should be horrifying to every American right\nYeah I mean you can take the positions on foreign policy we'll lift types would that look it's terrible what happened we should\nA bully faction people but at the end of the day the U.S Saudi relations are still important to let it be blow it up for one\nOr even one very grisly terrible murder and that's what I don't agree with that but that's a position people could argue and foreign policy journals an op ed pages and politicians can make the case but you know we should go after the arms deal or whatever that's one thing but to pretend that we don't know what happened to pretend that Mike Pompeo the victors they thought effect friday trip\nPretend that you know the personal relationship between the king and Trump or or uh uh the friends that are craft wrench Jared Kushner is like overcome\nThe fact is is

Russia it's weird how many people are\nHaving a you know accidents getting to the main thing isn't it hard we're in the middle of another huge international scandal in which the president is probably going to be criminal implicate ... ... if someone said we should call bone ... but I doubt that ... that are\nSick of it this way there is no way there are not cameras all over this conflict and the streets around me but yeah it floods which which is the euro chance\nWhich begs the question Carl are they that brazen that they yeah I mean obviously the way they killed him was to send a message and you just think they have to know that that it's good that they're that it's going to be recorded I mean okay I don't I\nOkay um\nWell when you control the cameras and everything else you know and you know the Trump not going to do anything to hold you accountable by the way you're yeah yeah no go ahead more likely to you're more likely to do whatever the heck you want\nYeah I hear is by the way John Brennan I was listening to him real quick\nWell I think Donald Trump and the White House is trying to protect the relationships that we know states hosts and Saudi Arabia but also their personal relationship with and the U.S [noise] I Would hope that a Trump and others are getting daily if not more regular\nIntelligence briefings from CIA and others about what it is that we know and I think this is the challenge for\nDoing this ration because I'm certain that see I have a lot of the nation about this and this is why I think ... is trying to figure out what's the story he can provide that's going to stand up to scrutiny or in line with U.S intelligence ...\n... ... ... it's extraordinary because now Trump is going to of course we caught\nAgain in his you know however many lies a day he tells right but then if anyone going to ask him like oh so they lied to you then if they now admit this right because he's when he ... he obviously has already on record as saying that they said they had no idea about any of this\nHoops Karl\n... see what happens over there you go okay go ahead\nYou know and not only that um you know he's basically showing that he is gullible you know this is the guy who says he's a great judge of character can make a good deal et cetera um and when he's\nYou know when it's proven that he was lied to um we're only one step away from proving that he knew what was going on and uh and he lied to the American people about it I'm either that or he has to come out and say that he's not the guy with the best judgment in the world\n[noise] um how you're a campaign strategist how dumb as it to come out how many days before a midterm election if you're Mitch McConnell and say we're going to cut ... your Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nOh it's beyond foolish um and uh but you have to remember ... whenever they're given the opportunity or they will run with it and so I think of what happened in twenty sixteen right Republican lost seats in the house they lost seats in the Senate\nUm and yet they've done all of what they've done over the last year and a half two years right now even if\nThey lose the majority in the house\nAnd Senate majority doesn't grow\nThey will not stop until they are completely ah rendered and capable of moving their their priorities forward and we've known for a long time that their goals are to\nRuin Social Security and to ruin Medicare uh this is something that they've been pushing for for decades and remember it's what's slapped back President Bush\nTen Fifteen Years ago when he came out after the midterms and sat right next up we're going to privatize Social Security and it just about cost him a the majorities in Congress well\nAnd by the way democratic leaders in congressional candidate had been arguing for months that these tax cuts are going to the are going to cause this and so you're right that makes them here comes a big gift were like this is what we told you\nThey were going to do I'm I'm looking at uh the we have a big fundraising advantage obviously there are Thirteen ... but you know I keep saying curling I'm sure you've had you know that there's many campaigns have you been through is just ...\nThose obviously those stories make us happy but then you just go don't listen to any told listened to you know the races where they said it's already over or you know ... right\nI mean everybody just needs to close their eyes and imagine one of two things happening the day after the election do you want to see a happy president\nYou don't have to fix\nThe ... you know that you have is the you know yeah I'm like sixteen dollars that the whole complex you know okay oh six twenty seven you know I like my wine complicated like my women oh not that complicated beautiful

[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYou know the answer is\nGoing to remain [noise]\nIt is the other show it wants to reduce reports like say one wants to revive our phone number a and a dingo for coming up live in Studio but right now\nJackie ... yes [noise]\n\n\nGood morning Jackie ... good morning how are you\nRight on that are\nIt's such a relative question these days isn't it\nThe fate of the Republicans in our hands right now right [laughter] um yeah I by the way so speaking of Trump Russia and crashing into each innocent people don't attack investigations that will ultimately prove their innocence guilty people attack investigations that will ultimately prove their guilt on thank you so\nWhat do you make a Rod Rosenstein obviously just said the American people are going to be confident that this was a fair investigation Rosen is tough\nTo figure out right 'cause he's he just got off the plane with a after venting a little bit of time with Trump's who knows I mean I'd like to believe that he's bearing on a level but it's hard to forget the letter he wrote to get ... fired right um you know then after that and he's a little a little back and forth right after that he felt you\nI you know then he stood up and said we're not going to be compromised and then another\nReport that he told Mahler he'd like him to wrap it up right up there I mean again half\nThat doesn't in that park dozens where confidence because you know this is a huge international investigation that has produced more indictments and guilty pleas than anything like it in history and you know and and to to put a timeline on it does seem suspect\nIt does yeah and and so it's hard to tell it's hard I mean the the problem is he's our best bet right because you you get rid of\nJeff Sessions a venue replace them with somebody like Matt ... for example who wants to shut the whole thing he's jeeze Jeff Sessions chief of staff they Trump is reportedly considering um ... it it's harder to get rid of Rosenstein and then ah you stepped into that place I mean right now\nWay it it is and the way that he's giving more autonomy and Mueller's investigation is being funded we're we're in the best place we can possibly be right now anything after this Trump gets a hold of it going to be worse\nRight as they even if they don't fire Mohler they shut the whole thing down and they can they can basically squeeze the funding yeah choke it they can show get to the point where they can't you can't breathe anymore yeah\nI mean it is such a mixed bag isn't it check it because I Know we always say you know you have to be patient and he's about ... doing his his work but it but I you know there is part of me because now they say oh well you had before the midterms I'm like going don't mark and people have a right to know if\nWe have a holy illegitimate really a criminal administration I Would\nSay that based on what you know now if that's not enough for you then you'll never right if you if you are paying at all paying attention then you should know what's going on and if what we already know you didn't enough evidence there's nothing left to get into\nThat he was about this latest I don't know if you're watching Rachel Maddow was obviously ... is this a Twitter making public these millions and millions of a Russian tweets and and you know again there's some thought to you know did they try to minimize it\nInitially because now they're going oh I mean I think we're at the end of the day we're going to find out is an extraordinary the impact they had on this election and the amount of\nUh you know of Twitter trolls and everything else All right\nYeah no we we I had that up on investigate\nRussia or you can read all about it too if you're curious I'm so Twitter finally yesterday what are the tweets that were state sponsored and it the the bulk of them came from\nA Russian Internet research agency or there were a small handful they came from Iran but the idea wise uh finally we knew that these tweets existed but we hadn't seen the content of them and ultimately what it figured out that there were ten million to each\nEye and two million a images and videos I mean that's a lot of tweets and images and videos and that those are just the ones that are originated with these fake account right to talk about the number of times that these are getting passed around and shared an amplified\nUm yeah I mean I Do think that the disinformation campaign and plus there's all we know from Twitter right so yeah I imagine these are shared via email or are these are shared on Facebook or other social media outlets this just this is a huge disinformation propaganda campaign that absolutely ... well I\nThink that people weren't influenced by this you're crazy yeah I was\nJust going to say Jackie we talked about your old pen professor of I'm Kathleen Hall Jamieson yeah yeah who would you know I Love my pen girls um [laughter] um\nBut anyway you know she did this I I've been reading a bit of her book she did the forensic analysis on that absolutely said you know that this is what put Trump in the White House\nBut I there was one thing in particular I just found interesting um\nShe talks about a specific she says she asks readers to imagine how different the twenty sixteen election might have been if Trump's campaign had also been hacked discouraging the emails with Paul Manafort Michael Cohen Michael Flynn ... Trump junior among other things this would've exposed correspondence about the notorious\nJune twenty sixteen Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer and Trump's pay off to warn actress to into a playboy model\nI mean ... yeah it it she makes a lot of great points but I mean it it it is beyond clear that Russia put Trump in the White House I mean it's it's yeah go ahead I mean are we thinking that Manafort also had to resent a recipe [laughter] that would have been real scandal [noise]\n... hours I Love their sparkling wine I loved the rose eight you'll be blown away by the fantastic\nQuality and the fantastic price for a limited time save up to Fifteen Percent off with one of the new radio mix sampler ... plus free shipping go to C.

a cyberwar how Russian hackers in trolls helped elect a president and what we don't can't and do know a Kathleen Hall Jamieson was Jackie's professor actually a law at Penn\nAnd she offers a forensic analysis a includes the Russian\nDeliver Trump's vicar which I think we all know but she just comes at it from a scholarly and it it is fascinating I've been reading some of that she's widely respected by political experts in both parties um she was asked point blank would Trump the president without the aid to Russia and she said no um she uh yeah she said\nShe currently like\nYou're

right um\n[noise] she said you can affect people within two than not changed their decision that alters the outcome or I'm arguing they persuaded enough people to either go to a certain way or not vote at all a Russian masterminds you\nThey pulled off the technological and political coup moreover she concludes the American media inadvertently help them achieve their goals but being on the lookout because we don't know with Russia still involved and they they are very likely are\nWith a lot of these voter disinformation things and um you know racially division ... than other oh All

that quality on almost\nAll home White House shouting I my boss President Trump says the U.S will wait before deciding whether to take action on reports the Saudis murdered journalist ... gee we're waiting for\nUh he's uh the lot last week the Washington Post fact checker column reported Trump's a hundred and ten billion and arms sale in Saudi Arabia is still fake calling a hundred and ten billion dollar figure fanciful and unlikely to come to fruition um\nHe's a ... over a year ago the Brookings Institution called it fake news\nHe said that most of the publicly announced items had been previously announced by the Obama administration there appear to be few if any sign contracts rather many of the announcements were Emily ... memorandums of interest there were six specific items adding up to twenty eight billion but all had been previously notified the Congress by the Obama administration\nSo even that's fake there is no hundred billion dollar Saudi arms deal it's not like\nRobertson fans even though the arms races there probably picturing a bunch of rednecks doing handstands trying to get past the finish line\n\nOkay I was just so we I was as I was saying to Bill Kristol earlier\nBut I don't know it's Trump isn't this isn't a Republican Party it's it's a cult\nWhereby they go hey we love the Muslim ban and we have Muslims boo oh you know\nIt's for however many of the nine eleven hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and now they have killed in an American permanent resident with a bone saw for seven minutes while he was alive and they're all like oh yeah yeah we like those Muslims Saudi Arabia is great because Trump's that so [noise] it there's no\n... is so and ...\nAll of that I was out of the country for a week and my blood pressure had never been lower I stayed off Twitter I've only checked maybe once a day maybe once every three days\nAnd it was the most peaceful week I've had two years and then I come back and you just cannot avoid it it's ... there's constant inundation by the news cycle noun everywhere you turn it's unbelievable\n[noise] um yeah and I just have no moral core anymore no moral leadership here is a a hertz with her\nWhile he was at a citizen of this thing had we're going to determine that and you don't know whether or not we have to do what do you know whether or not we should be up here I'm not going to try to\nSuppress\nWhy are you laughing what why it was wrong with people at a person that has the U.S with a degree was Washington Post reporter will get rid of it has the Senate residents had the same status as ... parents yeah\nVery good comparison with Miller thank you me I light up my own life over in\nOrder to get your investigation\nOkay ah I was just a blood is again here we go\nThough I just want to find out what's happening in fact secretary of asking me back to probably late tonight or early tomorrow morning he went to turkey was all over the voters but a lot of time with the British and he's going to vote for it but I'm not giving up a little\nHow about the optics that Emily ... giggling and smiling laughing pump pale shaken hands and then fill it up we talk about uh yeah but we're not going to affect\nYour literally the White House literally admitted that they are trying to\nCreate a story to cover up the murder\nOf a\nWashington Post journalist it's an insanity they're admitting that they are living like we're just trying to will try to cut out the other end just figure out a story to\nYeah yeah it's all the facts that we know okay\nYeah I don't want to talk about any of the facts snow otherwise for they they didn't why am either and if they want to yeah\nFor if you look in Saudi Arabia they're an ally under tremendous purchaser\nOf not only military what but what are the things when I when my ... my front committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things you had a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military life a lot of those are the ... orders of the history of this country\nProbably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been any orders for four hundred and fifty billion dollars\n... for instance I'll let up my own life and you know what else I'll do I'll take my own or you know\nMy phone also just lit up in Washington Post ... recommends to Trump to give Saudi Arabia a few more days to complete the investigation into the disappearance\nOf the journal\nWhat's that I'm Sorry ... told them to give a Saudi Arabia a few more a few more days into the investigation observatory to get a much more better resorting\nTo buy some more bleach and stuff I heard the uh even painted the walls of the room for this happened I mean if we can see a cleaning crew going in before the investigators will\nYeah who's your friend and whichever okay\nAnd your partner I'm John Brennan former CIA director talking about this\nIs an extraordinarily powerful individual who wheels for power in Saudi Arabia and something like this going after a U.S residents a journalist for the Washington Post\nAnd I saw the the ... emission abroad would require his personal authorization in my estimation of because this is something that to individuals would not carry out on their own ...\n[noise] yeah that seemed like hello planning involved\nEven men that he respects ... in the Saudi guy that I don't know his name\nAnd the U.S think full full Mr ... full power they have full power\nThey make people disappear ... or ... feet that's exactly what Trump wants to be we know that that's why he respects and yeah you know it it makes deals with these guys he wants to be them yeah exactly one more John Brennan\nI don't I don't know what they were thinking of where they just going to go in there and the target him and bring him back in this went wrong I don't know but ah the the size of the delegation that went there and some of the individuals involved to look so these are members of the Saudi royal guard who come directly under ... months\nSo uh this is something that maybe ... a month or you can get away with because of the very close relationship that he has with the White House he just very badly miscalculated booth the impact of this\nWe thought the boat and saw was a low it's like you're not saying we\nHave to talk I brought up on so we didn't think he was plugged in we eat this which did not nose plugged in we've got ... to an interrogation if you're just planting okay to talk a\nRicky in Montana you're on within a company hello\nOh girl I Want to try to talk to you to go ahead\nWith Trump is coming to Montana where I live in a town with like Seventy three thousand is the third largest city in the state yeah and\nAh we've got this email ... former GOP chairman\nIslam
