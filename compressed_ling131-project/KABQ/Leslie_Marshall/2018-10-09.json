okay\nHave I mentioned this whole family ... means to go oh\nJody Hamilton discussing um you know judicial stuff as we do and commercial break here all the time [noise]\nYeah but listen I Want one thing I've said this over and over ... we got to stop bringing a knife to a gun fight we have to fight differently does not mean we need to lie and cheat and steal one of the things we were saying because Charlie Pierce was saying he is correct that is very difficult to impeach a Supreme Court judge but you know what\nMitch McConnell makes up a new ... new rural every day and guess what not only can you vote to expand the Supreme Court to more seats you can shrink it yep and I\nI absolutely would do it and guess what that would get rid of the two illegitimate picks the Donald Trump pet number we've said over and over again\nWhen Mohler is done and he's proven to be a totally not just a totally illegitimate president but a traitor to the United states we better not do people keep saying can't we undo all was when they can well in the constitution we actually can't can't\nAccept that except there are that are saying yeah there are ... and we just can't we've got to turn out in such a big numbers that we have those options the very first Supreme Court was only six people right then\nRight there were six and I know people have asked that question and I think that is really we've never been faced with this is if this is proven to be as\nI Believe it already has proven to be a totally legitimate election that that is I think the first thing you would do because it's the last two on that are out and so anyway that is one solution I'm Colin\nPowell welcome to the resistance no kidding oh home\nEven though disease [noise]\nUm [noise] he scorched Trump on Sunday for placing a himself rather than the American people at the center of the nation he said my favorites rewards and our constitution or the first three words we the people who is it sounds like a William Shatner speech from start\n[laughter] ...\n...\nBut recently it's become me the president as opposed to we the people and you see things that should not be happening he has criticized Trump or insulting everybody from World leaders to blacks to immigrants to women for calling the media the enemy of the people said how can the president of United States get up\nAnd say the media is the enemy of Americans hasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the presses or what anyone says in the first amendment that's why we have though to protect that kind of speech as for immigration\nHe said the world is watching it as opposed to the top of ministries in separate get separating migrant mothers and children ... disease all\nYeah did you see there was a a immigration proceeding and the a child was to she was too that had to speak yeah right\nOkay um hey speaking of illegitimate [noise]\nWhich is kind of like Russia [noise] get out a lot of our business

in the ... the backlash against women so they're\n... they're in their ... you know differences and the sexes and all ... all of this anger that has been you know uh obviously built up because of the Kavanaugh stuff the video before a purportedly shows a feminist woman pouring a mix of water and bleach on crutches a multiple men riding on a subway who were men spreading\nUm conservatives in the
