Falla are probably butchering the pronunciation there but he\nSaid look you know we regret this incident we're gonna bring swift justice to whoever was responsible that's kind of boilerplate stuff and then he slipped in this thing looking around to a pretty empty crowd um but still I think well aware that a number of CEOs from major corporations run the world still showed up but just held their meetings behind the scenes come into their deals\nThat quote the kingdom are these partners who are here with us today are certainly going to look back and find out\nHow committed the kingdom is to its partners that stay the course and quote I mean it really to me seems like a\n... you know they will so they are asked what would you say we will feather your nest\nYeah I mean they are announcing fifty billion dollars in deals made today I'll take note the U.S clearly wanted to have this both ways you remember the White House sort of made a big deal\nA few days ago that Steven Mnuchin treasury secretary was going to boycott the conference right they they understood the outrage here well he's still crept into Riyadh yesterday anyway Cynthia down for a photo op with mama been saw him on the crown prince anyways so clearly we are pretending to show a lot of concern and\nA question the nature of this relationship but still sending pretty top officials over there to signal or our support I Will note that the Saturday website the government was hosting this conference was briefly hacked overnight in a photo of Mohammed bin ... with the words ISIS spray painted on his to Nick\nAnd brandishing a sword as Christmas are consuming kneeled in\nFront of him was put up as the leaves landing page on the conference website ... where they shut it down\nNow he has a guy for a review of reporting that they found body parts of the show again in the garden of the Saudi or ... or console or consul general I guess was his title who is the guy who went back to Saudi Arabia the day after this this murder he was recalled I'm as a ... a cooperation of that\nNot that I'm seeing and I will point out that uh it it can we continue to see kind of be\nAnd it troubles me to applaud his strategic thinking care but that Russia barely won the Turkish president here really has found a way can to continue to be the one\nDriving this story by this sort of slow drip of information to the news media today you know as this conference launches he gives a speech on TV which does feel all of the headlines right away saying look we have evidence that this murder was being planned for days at any sort of\nAssertion that this was an interrogation that went south very quickly and accidentally or fall\nA I had sort of doubted several days ago after seeing everyone find a way to you know be the story driver for maybe two weeks I thought okay fine you to look at our Saudi explanation here\nBe the sort of centers that are you know the the power centers that are steering this story are going to shift a little bit away from Accra ... I mean everyone continues to be the one driving the headlines here and I think he will continue to want\nA slowly evolving story as opposed to collaborating media reports that clear things up in a different way I think he sees the potential the storytelling potential inherent in this murder\nYeah yeah it's it's it's incredible what else is up\nLooking at a ... you know serving the U.S government agencies today and to some of my colleagues making these inquiries to see if there's been any actual shift to either deploy the U.S armed forces to the southern border or to actually direct the state department or other us aid agencies to cut\nA foreign assistance to these northern triangle countries in Central America Guatemala Honduras El Salvador the country's Trump yesterday said they're going to lose their foreign aid because they weren't able to and of course it would have been impossible to stop migrants from leaving their countries\nAnd making the journey north to the United states the Pentagon says no plans are currently in place to send troops to the border of the state department says it's received no guidance\nAbout cutting aid and I would put this sort of into a quickly or ... you know long dating category of things that President Trump is promising his base of supporters\nIn the run up to the election that he'll probably say no consequences if he actually doesn't deliver on right those ten percent tax cut that nobody's actually planning on giving a this notion that we are going to somehow get a million jobs created if we continue with arms sales to this\nAnd then all these things middle Easterners traveling in this caravan we're going to cut the aid I mean it's all red meat but I don't think there are any indication\nIt's all live you're going
