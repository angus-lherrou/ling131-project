going on in the world today this report brought to you by goats for the old goat dot com and Ellen ... new book loving what you do on the line with us is the author of side swipe former congressman Bob Ney Bob welcome back to the program\nWell thank you so ah first of all before we get into the news um I I Would love to hear I mean you know you were a member of Congress for years you were inside the Republican Party or outside it now I'm In a ... what's your thought on the state of politics here one week out from the election\n[noise] well the Republican Party has in my mind thing and try to kind of be quiet in the sense that they can't control President Trump he goes about doing whatever he does\nAh I Know from the inside still the members are just almost hysterical because you know they are trained on their campaigns he does something he says something you know I think you and I can name and things and take up your entire show what he's done last week\nA they also don't have a record really to run on they haven't been able to accomplish much so I think that a lot of the Republicans have given up on the house they're trying to salvage themselves now\nI wouldn't know though it's about voter turnout and I tell friends of mine democratic consultant to say well you know this is done I say it's not by any machinations\nAnd and the and the other question I halfway Bob is the question that I've always screaming at the TV whenever a a\nA you know a teeny talking head as interviewing a pundit or a politician\nAnd they never asked this damn question and it makes me absolutely nuts what impact do you think voter suppression is going to have on this election we know for example last presidential election over a hundred thousand people were thrown off the voting rolls in Wisconsin Trump won by twenty thousand over a hundred thousand people were thrown off the voting rolls in Michigan maybe over two hundred thousand\nAnd Trump won by what fourteen thousand same thing in Pennsylvania same thing in Florida it was voter suppression in two thousand three Ninety thousand African Americans out the voting rolls that\nBy Jeb Bush that got his brother George within five hundred votes of the presidency wrecked a what impact is voter suppression this this election fraud that the Republican Party has been running since the Nineteen eighties what impact a second I have on this election\nI think it's going to have a big impact because look again you know and you know it and I know it it is about turnout now we can talk about Trump and all the things he's done we'll ask you a couple of years or last week but it's still going to be about voter turnout\nAnd you can't turn people out who have been thrown off the voting rolls\nYou can't break you can't turn them out if they'd been thrown off the voting rolls or people you know get the skin disgusted by the system et cetera they don't show up to vote can't get them out and the Republicans will squeak by which is what they're hoping to do right they're hoping to squeak by\nAmazing so what's in the news today\nWell I'm Talking about election exactly that type of thing about the one thing that should worry the Democratic side would be a\nMedium turnout and that would be scary uh you know they've got to have a high turnout or voters have to be able to devote a lot of money is going to be spent and right now the articles talking about how much more\nOn the Democratic side has raised in the Republican side and frankly that's good in itself but it doesn't count if you look at the voter suppression if you look at\nWhile I've also seen those numbers and they don't include dark money and so you've got the ... by the way ahead who just dumped three hundred million dollars you know in most of us being poured in in this month on these vicious ads that we're seeing on TV and nobody is counting that because it's not going to a campaign so they say well the Democrats are raising more money than the Republicans I'm Sorry three hundred million dollars really\nRight and there's a lot and you write in it and there can be money spent from now forward that the other thing is is a lifetime in politics yet I Know it's around the corner so I think it's you know something that's got to be watched and the you know what happens at the polls\nOn the Democratic side has done a great job uh in fact some of the farm team I call it a there's money out there through some of the pac supporting the Democratic side they're helping state legislatures because they're focusing on preexisting conditions Republicans can't win on data ... what they have done or not done with preexisting\n... Seventy times to deny people coverage from every existing conditions\nAnd it's a big ... and I will tell you this there are tons of Republicans that you know they're not all the healthy side I mean there are tons of Republican citizens who are out in the cold because of preexisting conditions gray and so when\nYou started or on red states by the way\n... ... and and they're on the wrong side of that issue and also Medicare for all that's been pretty successful I think with the um you know with the Democratic side of the issues I think are in the hands of the Democratic side and I think it's there's Toulouse\nA they've got to be very careful and again you mentioned voter suppression look at the history of it\nAnd when you do a ... elections are held in ways in one in ways\nPeople didn't think they would be there for two hundred and forty plus your voters precious little used by the white people to hang on the political and economic power and the bottom name on their side swipe thank you\nFor talking with you thank you for being with us today it's fascinating day we'll be back tomorrow same time same place\nAnd in the meantime don't forget\nThe most consequential election
