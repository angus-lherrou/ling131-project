I'm not unfortunately a scientist who's focused on insects\nUm unfortunately but I Can't tell you anecdotally um I've had the same experience myself I'm In the springtime driving through the Central Valley of California I've been here for about twenty six years and say that the un or Twenty years ago driving to Central Valley in the springtime especially would just be covered with insects\nYou'd have to probably stop multiple times to fill up your\nUm windshield wiper flew it just so you could keep the windshield clean\nBothersome but you also felt like well you know this is a good thing because of the facts are reproduced saying they're providing food for a lot of animals it seemed like a normal thing anecdotally I can tell you that over the last ten to Fifteen Years it's been a a you just don't see it like that anymore it's it's clearly got to a situation where we are no longer\nI think experiencing or we're now starting to experience a real decline on the fundamental food webs on this planet and it's it's an incredible concern at all I can say it's all of your listeners out their support politicians who believe in climate change and want to do good\nFor the world all the other stuff that you talk about as important it is isn't as much as I support it doesn't mean anything if we can no longer live on this planet\nAnd I'm a Tom you know amen\nThank you for your good

Saudi embassy right I'm mister show gee you know\nYeah um you recall back in September of two thousand sixteen when James Woolsey quit with the Trump campaign\nHide but specifically I Do continue\nYeah he quit and he he he was the one that informed the FBI they blend was planning with the church\nTo a to a with a patrol ah ah Linda the cleric delivers the Poconos\nOh yeah I remember that now yes\nFor the evening and he's going to listen back to and you know it you know what ... what was going to do that cleric\nOh I'm guessing is going to put him on trial and killing\nIt was going to put him on trial and killing for because he said he was involved in planning that coup right and so\nIt's real rich for me to hear turkey pointing the finger and Saudi Arabia and and also um anybody who thinks for a second that Donald Trump did not know that this was going to happen is smoking something\nClear all I Want to know what happened in the phone call the to the ... the NBS the the guys running Saudi Arabia had two days before this happened with Jared\nKushner\nYou know the last time these guys are together they were up until four o'clock in the morning two nights in a row you know smoking or drinking or just whatever they were doing and you know plot and how to rule the world these two young thirtysomething princes basically\nAnd almost immediately after that and there's large widespread speculation now are including among people in the intelligence community\nThat Jared Kushner shared classified information with them BS about people in his own\nFamily and court who were not entirely loyal to him because he went on a purge\nAnd some people died and some people lost all their money or large chunks of their money and everybody was scared to death and some and then then Jared Kushner has another phone call with him and two days later he got this Washington Post journalist says is slaughtered\nAnd somehow jak ... no longer upside down on his Manhattan property right and I mean this is the problem with having corrupt leaders they are so easily black males even if Trump wanted to say something to the Saudis\nBy now I'm sure they have so much crap on him there's nothing there's nothing they can threaten them with\nWhile in there and they're finding his family I mean the Trump crime family is for the last decade or so is a growing where there's pushing our branch of it or the or the avant garde Don Eric branch and Donald isn't growing based on money from them by and large\nAutocratic regimes all around\nThey're all around the banking for the

far as what is at stake in this election\nIn in addition we need to on the air let them do the essential number to call another thing\nTo we need to have a national ad campaign and targeted states specifically publicly shaming what public and start doing ... to ...\nTo the heart of why mainstream media do your job this time you know I mean they're not\nGoing to do their job the that's the thing they're not doing their jobs yeah you know you have Coca Cola in Atlanta Georgia you know we need corporations on board to help us you know a target this message yup\nWell I mean you're right Joel ... a lot of companies are stepping in you know whether it's on Saudi Arabia or other issues and doing the right in my huge void ... where we used to have moral leadership in the oval office and now we have just complete\nLack of morality of any kind yeah right right okay oh okay yes ah Chris Van Hollen let's talk about uh he's talking about Trump or in Saudi Arabia\nWas shameful that the president of the United states would allow himself to be used as a mouthpiece for the Saudi regime cover a story here\n[noise] um yeah that that ... a Christian home and went on to say\nAnd for the president United States to participate in what clearly is Saudi effort it cover up and whitewash uh is is really um undermining the credibility United States has so many ways\n... here's the thing like we said this every week right to not conspiratorial it's just you get to the point you would not put anything past oh yeah mhm this president or this administration and it's like ... and how far does this go I mean\nI Wonder if that were involved in this I mean he was banned in Saudi Arabia for criticizing Trump the mortar yeah Andy obviously increasingly criticized the king\nAnd you just go we obviously had the intelligence could have warned him at least yeah the only thing worse than that I mean it's and here's Trump actively lying for them on his his things oh he's not a citizen will ah shouldn't matter they even bother to get their lives straight right he was wrote killers yesterday right and\nOkay Chris Van Hollen again talking about a a CIA\nCIA said with respect to the and again this was in the public reporting\nWith respect to the uh the killing that there is no way the crown prince would not know whether the king new I don't know but there is no way that the crown prince who was taking the reins of day to day our government is Saudi Arabia or was not either hatching the plot certainly aware of this ...\nYes he was traveling says just handed me another Trump telling them directly opposed by things that are on videotape this one for the record\nInterest in Saudi Arabia or Russia for that matter any suggestion that I have is just more fake news which there isn't any well I mean he still disputing Lester Holt interview so I mean\nHe's on tape saying how much money he gets from Saudi Arabia and how that how much how many of his uh places yeah condos vi yeah yeah it
