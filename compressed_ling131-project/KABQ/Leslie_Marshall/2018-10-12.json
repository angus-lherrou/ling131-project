I'll be doing a panel on Sunday a congressman Lou I Believe is on a Saturday panel he joins us now the morning congressman\nGood morning Stephanie\n... congratulations on your on your your glowing press\nOh I'm just trying to tell the truth yeah people want to write about it that's great\nYeah well you're you're already a Twitter God but um I first of all by the way you've been talking about Jared Kushner for a long time and you tweeted today Jared Kushner has been promoting the Saudis and their new ruler despite skepticism from us national security officials it's been a while but I think it's time to ask again why does Jared Kushner have a security clearance\nUm this I'm a I'm usually the the Saudi journalist a story is really gets more horrible by the day doesn't it\nYes it's terrific what happened a space on public reporting it appears that the Saudi ruler\nOrdered a murder of a journalist because he didn't like what he was writing about Saudi Arabia and this journalist happened\nTo actually a live in the United states like he was in Turkey at the time with his fiance but this is pretty brazen and if Saudi Arabia can do this you wonder what else that they can do\nYeah yeah well I mean but once again\nI mean this president you saw what he said yesterday ... you know he obviously\nA Jared Kushner has had business with Saudi Arabia we we know that you know they're they buy a lot of Trump's condos I mean once again here we are where this president ... is not looking out for Americans he's looking out for himself and his family\nThat's absolutely right you know I went to law school I had no idea what the my much cause was an outlet Americans know\nAnd they're ... put that in because they believe that it was corrupting of elected officials including the president to have a gift and income from foreign sources it appears that we're starting to radio he's getting some sort of financial benefit\nThat's one reason if we flip the house we will get Donald Trump's tax returns\nOr I can I say well you know it sends a thrill of my leg to the thought of you and and uh Adam ship with subpoena power as I told you before [laughter] but you\nTweeted his vice chair of the a D triple C\nUm this new large pole validate what we're seeing Americans wanna flip the house these are very good numbers for Democrats um I keep telling people congressmen do not don't get complacent do look at the polls just get registered get out to vote and everyone you know out to vote right but I that being said obviously things are looking really good in the polling right\nThey are so I'm going to um be at this parent on credit card on Saturday cobra twentieth at two thirty one it'd be talking about these house races\nAnd last year my colleagues elected me as a ... D triple the summit Terry what's gonna happen on the election night we're targeting about a hundred still races now not all of them have the same shot of winning this was going to happen when a when about Fifteen feet pretty easily\nWe need twenty three to flip\nFor the remaining see we're going to lose them by three hundred vote\n... six hundred lose somebody thousand it'll be very very close but because\n\nI'm congressman there's obviously a lot of stories about voter suppression whether it's a you know ... in a while where I'm at the north Dakota whether it's in Georgia I'm a Texas we're hearing are ...\nCan you tell us like what can we still do because we have time right ... and obviously there's a lot of outcry about the kind of voter suppression efforts going on\nRight now so we do have ... stewing in federal court you try to stop that voters depression but there is a fundamental problem when you do have a Republican White House with Republican Congress they're just not going to do anything about this it's really the only way to be voter suppression is to just\nGet more people to vote [noise] yeah and that's really where you are right now does that yeah we have to get a review will turn out\nWe got to get these levers of power back to change these ridiculous voter suppression laws\nUm by the way so of course speaking of you know common wisdom some polls and pundits and of course they were saying oh this Kavanaugh thing is going to backfire on Democrats um ... as you said today ... apologize to Kavanaugh but a majority of Americans oppose the confirmation of cabin on who's going to apologize to them and that sort of course we're seeing in the polls that that uh\nThe majority of Americans not only did not want him confirmed they believe Dr Ford and not Kavanaugh and think that this is a disgrace what happened\nThat is correct and that's why they were actually um two are the Asians that came out ... ratings changes\nSince Kavanaugh's confirmation process or the ... report just move three to show seats closer to the Democratic column and another one of the nation had another ten seats move closer to Democrats four seats move away that sort of a negative six so\nDiscovery process has actually help the Democrats and not hurt us so I think we're in a good position to do to flip the house in November", "show_name": "Leslie Marshall", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "12"}
