we we can before would they would they talk about over Kavanaugh's you'd be a home run for the Republican Party\nEvery Sunday on the network shows it's what ever\nThe Republican talking point is that what we're going to sit around and discuss yeah and we're going to pretend this is all normal even though we have basically the personification of evil sitting in the White House we're not going to

right okay what are you a ...\nAs you said a his approval rating has been garbage for Nineteen and twenty months he's been in office that's the bottom line you say White House media strategy is pointless no president after twenty months has ever been this unpopular ever trumps can hide from the press or talk all\nDay it doesn't matter um but yeah it it that's why it's the ... that that makes me crazy\nIt is and and and the there's a lot of chatter about you know he ... he seems to be very needy read but you know political wrote a piece last week an interesting piece about uh how Fox News doesn't run his rallies at night anymore\nYeah oh God that that had to had to hit them the more specific he doesn't get ratings anymore so they've stopped carrying is so what do you do the same thing
