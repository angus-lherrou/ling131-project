mean I blame the press for some of this too rudely but but somebody told you mentioned some Republican da da da da and it's like wait a minute make sure you have to look away their endorsement yeah I mean yeah\nThey they they wanted more a a real investigation and\nAnd then and then on things like perjury they're going to do their own investigation and if it turns out that they believe perjure themselves or you don't need a quarter law it's there for again writing or they're breaking a credential yeah\nI mean where do you agree speaking of I might movement a thank you good guys you are one of them and it it's\nI mean is just astounding that you know ... ... it's hard to really sort of put into words how disgusting what Susan Collins didn't she didn't she could have just said I'm voting\nYes right but she became like the female face for the Republican Party of basically calling Dr Ford a liar I mean you can't you can't say she's credible but she's just a little east confused about who it was\nRight well she's voted she's voted for\nEvery Supreme Court that ... has been a senator she's voted for every single one that's about all of a sudden she voted for\nKagan set of my or but she had no problems voting for a leader or or suture Robert right so\nYou know the idea that she that at any point she was going to go against that it was ludicrous thing that speech show the thing that speech showed was she knew all along what she was going to vote\nAnd was just ... she was just a tension or in for the whole time\nYeah I mean that the whole thing it's uncorroborated when they know full well that they ... the FBI did not talk to forty witnesses who would've caught corroborated right I mean it is it's just\nAnd by the way you wrote a piece false accusations of rape usually end up being proven falls I mean this is just such a ... ... ... what is the number anywhere from two percent the six percent or something yeah\nI Know we usually on federal route five but that five percent okay that five percent number is misleading because that five percent in includes includes a you know sometimes when there's a there's more than one witness and you know they were nothing can be\n... you know there there's all kinds of reasons why but that that number is ... the real number is actually very low\nYeah well that's that's what I'm saying it's like you know for them to put out this ... name that it's like some sort of you know rational this this happens all the time and and as you were saying that pathetic little skit he did about you know you know the mother son telling her you know his mother that she's wrongly accused it's like yeah\nYeah yeah and the other thing that they leave out in in discussing this is that is that almost all of those cases that they're investigated by the police or with a full investigation and they prove yeah you know what the guy didn't do it\nAnd so and it was a false accusations and if it's been liberally false accusation what happened and we we lived I Lived cases just from the last few months women are arrested and sometimes put in jail for making a false accusation\nRight you said the fact that most ... of the false cases are proven false it's a pretty big incentive for someone who's falsely accused want is full investigation as possible and that's and everything we needed to know right is that she's the one on the investigation and he obviously didn't\nYeah and I love by the way I Love by the way that this you know I Believe I Believe ... something happens that Christie and Bob the board but it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh it's like yeah and then you don't believe her you don't believe ... or you're thinking oh\nCertainly drunk woman you couldn't possibly know I've known who really almost ... you are and the other thing I Love they leave out of this that that discussion is they never stay and mark judge wasn't there either\nIn their teens and young twins or the latest news that pain just go to

know to the hospital power to be elected has basically put another illegitimate\nA judge on the Supreme Court I'm Sorry it's just that this everybody knows this FBI investigation was a sham and but it's but you're right it's all about oh is that ... that's when right\nThat's the way it and and and you know a guarantee you if Brock Obama hey was under was badly under criminal indictment had nominated someone who needed an emergency FBI sham investigation in order to cram him through to get forty eight no votes\nYou think do you think the D.C press would have spent the weekend\nToasting Obama and his amazing when of course not yeah the the the the narrative would have been this is the White House in chaos in disarray\nOr they don't know what they're doing but you know we all saw the the the coverage over the weekend this was an amazing win for the White House he's so savvy you know Republicans outsmart the Democrats again and and just a quick boy I mean on friday literally the narrative was if Democrats defeat\nKavanaugh it's going to be a huge win for the Republican Party because it's going to energize their base yep Sunday the media narrative was Kevin are wins therefore it's a huge win for Trump in the White House 'cause it energize the Republican thank you I mean it yeah it's it's ... for Democrats as usual it says you lose tells you lose\nRight and I'm sick of the ... we just have to get out and vote we just have to I honestly let us doubled down I you know ... ... registering herself registering other people checking our registration all of that because you're right you just the ... will drive you insane I mean I ... and you're absolutely how could it be both things\nYeah and and and and again you know Trump was\nTweeting over the weekend I mean he's he's describing Democrats as the mob you know it was arson is with the with the lighting a torch I mean he's basically inciting violence\nAgain wait let's let's listen to that 'cause I I was I was gonna say yeah I can take\nA look you don't hand match is doing arson is\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they become\nWow so as you're saying\nYeah how do you listen to that\nHow do you listen to that extraordinary moment in American politics where the president United States is describing the opposition party\nAs a as a arson this mob and hear those words of approval and how if you're a D.C pundit do than type up a story about what an amazing winning streak Trump is on it it's just mind boggling and that's what's so dangerous about this\nUh and and you know the authoritarians I mean us Malcolm Nance your friend up here for ...\nTop goals corrupt the top court in any country and try to de legitimize the press and Trump is going full force on both of those\nAnd we get columns about how savvy and smart he is and boy he's on a winning streak I mean it's it's very dangerous\nYeah I I mean and ... well how did you give me this one again this is this is the second one is angry mom thing\nIn their quest for power\nHave turned you do an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from\nHundred people who are less\nThat weren't you know what those people they couldn't sit in the front row when we have here [noise]\nI mean Eric ... it really is it's become angry mind meeting people who don't think attempted rape is perjury belong on the Supreme Court for life right who who really believe women\nAnd and that was the other thing that annoyed me about you know this DC a commentary about how Trump won and now Democrats screwed this up and Democrats energize the base what exactly does the press thing the Democrats should have done right not investigated to see if the Supreme Court nominee was possibly guilty of sexual assault\nMean it was Republicans who demanded this what turned out to be an FBI sham investigation which extended this all for a week what were what exactly did Democrats do that they shouldn't have done\nRight yeah and I know when Lindsey Graham says oh I didn't do this to ... or a Kagan yeah well guess what they didn't have allegations of sexual assault against them I mean we didn't do it to ... I guess my because they didn't have allegations of sexual assault against them they didn't perjure themselves I mean to try to save forty witnesses\nAnd three accusers our democratic plot right\nRight and and and and and again that that's what was so annoying a friday Thursday and friday what became crystal clear that the FBI investigation was a shame how do you not interview have it on for it I mean clearly\nA if Ford if Kavanaugh was forced to answer questions from FBI agents you know if he told the truth he wasn't going to be a Supreme Court justice if he lied he open himself up to legal jeopardy so obviously from day one the White House made a decision that was no way\nThey could risk having Ford beat a like a cat and are being interviewed by by the agents\nWhere we have answered that that right there the whole thing is is a sham and every reporter who's solve the the you know the results of the report knew it was a sham\nBut instead of staying so they have to like go to Democrats oh do you think it's a shame yes it's a shame and then the reports are well the two parties are split on this FDR report yeah I Know they they just won't say it for themselves but they just won't say what's in front of the\nWell I mean and by the way where it was that story over the weekend that Don McGahn told the president if he did it a real FBI investigation like Trump initially I guess was asking for he said he said it will be disastrous\nNear Canada yeah of course yeah okay\nSo uh using Kavanaugh you also tweeting Kavanaugh will be the first justice nominated by someone who lost the popular vote confirmed by senators representing less than half the country while posed by a majority of the country um\nYeah there's so much that we ... when we get the levers of power back I was just reading I mean ... Harris represents forty million people now and she has the same power as Susan Collins who represents what one point someone in a million yeah\nYeah I mean it's amazing you know and people are talking about what to do about the Supreme Court\nAh and whether you start stacking it and things like that I mean ... ... people forget that on the eve of uh the two thousand sixteen election when it looked you know when everyone including the entire Republican Party thought Hillary is going to win a ... several\nRepublican senators came out weeks before\nAnd they said we will never confirm\nAny Supreme Court justice that Hillary Clinton nominates a a you know because of her emails or would have him but I mean we're in the position that you know if Democrats um you know if a Democrat wins the White House in twenty twenty and Republicans still clinging to the Senate um I don't see how a Democratic president would ever get\nUm um you know a nominee on the Supreme Court\nBegan and then the Republicans are part of this cult that they will just if it's only fifty and they've got fifty one how is the Democratic president ever going to get anyone on the Supreme Court\nYeah and then speaking of changing the rules you heard this yesterday just take a listen about McConnell being asked if Donald Trump\nOr to name somebody in the final year of his first term in twenty twenty are you saying

you can allow him to stay on the Supreme Court for life this is not just like oh well this is only generations of the things that will affect all of us forever\nRight you can't go on air and live in front of the country and break the rules that you have promise to uphold yeah job interview I'm going to steal the car and now I Want to a car salesman yeah I ...\nI Know I mean again it's been said over and over but in any woman at a job interview going I'm here as a wife and a mother and crying and screaming and bright so that's what he was like a chick trying to get out of a speeding ticket\nNo black men are white women or woman period yeah no one by the white male right over the white male could have gotten away with that it was a Shia these as ... which what her saying like oh I Believe Dr for but then the angry white man's scared me so I changed my mind here she is\nAfter hearing Christine Ford's very compelling and painful testimony I thought oh my goodness ah\nJust needs to withdraw and but then when he came back with ... a forceful denial and the anger and an English that he showed yeah a ... and then the lack of cooperation and\nShe feels a little turned on and I'm just gonna say oh he's angry that I heard ... angry I just I have to then just totally changed by um yeah my principles just disappeared because I [noise] [laughter]\nWait a minute and then she knows\nThat keeps saying there's no ... well we know how many witnesses were ready to cooperate and that she had the that they would not let the FBI speak too\nI mean it's it's a I mean you've got your books have backup all this stuff too by the way yeah\nYeah it works out I Wonder she's part of the devil's triangle now yeah I think probably have an ... losing harassed off as we speak\nSo what I had a miracle [noise] All right my back\nUp with your ... your [noise] and uh whatever they she's producing the next hour some whatever's happening I I don't really think about it but [noise] parent leaves all the stuff you know show [noise]\n\nWe all make promises big small tested over time in distance tried by circumstances and decisions\nAre pledge allegiance to the flag\nOf the United states of America\nI Do solemnly swear to bear true faith in the lead you\nOld enough\nRazors better or worse\nAnd my mother didn't want to believe me um but that sat me down with the other male adult party who immediately started crying and had had to admit it and then\nUm I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister\nAnd I didn't know that until it was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying to when you hear these things or successive it's not just one victim it's many it's the the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue to ten years escalate they find new victims so when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ...\nJulie sweating and you know knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believe you but didn't believe that it was at a ... that it was\nYes the other members of my family look me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was given what Sam\nIf it was fall spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white substance on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that's done to me for the rest of my life\nAnd when I told my other family members they said well I Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want to you that he had her son at you're telling me because they can't handle that\nWell that's what this was so egregious people react in so much to this Catherine that was just another layer of of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her second one so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the of\nCourse not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for the Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him\nAnd his face is what five inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah it really knows right look at you and she knows all\nObviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean the fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was nominated\nI mean it's just I\nYeah I yeah I ... I couldn't watch her whole speech I was like on she just our parents we there's a lot of women who've been raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that that is the dividing line all the men are innocent of this and\nThis part that she believes him about really he's port perjured himself how many times but she believes in about ...\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn presidents wherever you are all the time\nThey aren't over turned off the tower there and listen to the standards that he put forth in his conversation with me and also I ... in the here and he says for president along a fabulous precedents like road to be overturned\nIt would have to have been gravy a slave wrong and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in answer the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not local twenty twenty would obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed into Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but um it's an upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\n\n... politically\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard of ... go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere is something that you're right about whether it's Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway or the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just eviscerated the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kind of like again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh so you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just like sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr Ford did don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women you know you need to be responsible for their own blah blah blah well\nIt's something I tweeted recently it's Ninety two to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other right\nThere is no suddenly they're all mine and that's what they want you to believe so that means yeah if you're [laughter]\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women who are obviously credible and have cooperating witnesses they've been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report that think that the truth\nOf it is that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd go you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said this that the white women are first a a barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and white man first degree of saying he's lying if not him\nThat whole discuss things get Trump did you know about the mother or grandmother mother I'd been unfairly mom mom what am I going to do like\nYou know just before again as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash of of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's a yeah okay so ah Kellyanne Conway\nOh there are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we can get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again I go to this and her speech justice Kavanaugh justice cabinet oh I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes versus Wade as it is settled law\nPlease write he wouldn't be on this list if ... if he was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just it's [noise]\nYou know what kills me is you know like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get the oceans for their mistresses\nAnd it it it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses because there's not going to end I think what people have to recognize that\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves that I said the system was working exactly as it was\nDesigned by white right conservative met it worked perfectly they got\nCabinet he will control women's bodies you will control whether Trump is brought down or not\nHe will do exactly what they wanted the system works for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nThis is what the the rhetoric they always uses ... stuff like this coming on Conway said\nTo be pro choice and two thousand Eighteen that your first sex selection abortion they offer late term abortion taxpayer funded abortion abortion after ... ... ... they they can feel you know that is the issue here with you that way the way it will be over ... ... what I mean\nShe just filibusters over and over right it just you know you're just lift all these things that are ... ... yeah not happening right extreme okay here we go\nPeople are going to look at state law the circuit law and they're not going to look at issues like late term abortion they're going to look at sex selection of Washington there's certainly going to look at abortion after a nonpartisan scientists doctors say a fetus can feel pain\nThis whole matter on the left of abortion anytime anyone anywhere on demand with absolutely no commonsense applied to it was\nRight that we were all forced to do a drive through abortions under barely get on with fries yeah mhm\n[noise] what did you read that whole article saying that\nAbortion is a hundred percent the males problem caused by men it would allow you to flee written yeah yeah a hundred percent of abortions either cause or the fault of men yeah yeah yeah All right well let's just all just\nWatch him but that there is an entitlement we were just speaking about how cabinet\nAs a young man of rich entitled white boy was told you can take\nA woman when you want her email play devil's triangle with your friends without asking her and push or in a room and it's like you're entitled now to be on the Supreme Court yeah it doesn't matter what it is there's a privilege and entitlement that an entire group of young men white privilege conservative rich men\nAre have been raised to believe is there's yeah take a woman they will take a seat and even the way he [noise]\nGreat he uh he drunk Donald who's a drunk TV what do you named ... ... talk about I mean again that people's lives are are being talked about is if it's a game right he said oh at ... level the playing field you know them talking about this like a like a when you know I'm curious\nWhy was it they got you to have it from your worst strength about her and\nFight for Kavanaugh at that point\nWell there are a lot of things happening that or correct they were true there were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had it even the playing field because it was very unfair to\nJudge now I can you know very nicely said justice ... right it was a very unfair situation do I even the playing field at once that started this tale through it was very very unfairly didn't\n[noise] level the playing field [noise] end zone dance quite the cholesterol yeah I mean just [noise]\nThe way they talk about it just makes it even worse among the when it pretty soon we're going to have to take selfies in the middle of our

from Milwaukee in about ... ... and I would listen to your show in the way that keeps me awake during that drive so I have to say thank you for keeping me alive\nO fart jokes keeping you alive God Bless you [laughter] ... you know you posted\nThis on Facebook which I Love you said oh no people who keep babies in cages\nA could care less when innocent black people are murdered in mock sexual assault survivors don't like our protest tactics I guess we should just smile and say please nicely maybe them they'll decide to overthrow patriarchy in white supremacy\nOr we must stop immediately because it turns out voters and Republican strongholds don't like it when we raise our voices Neal at sporting events tell our stories of survival are generally exist so we must stop doing all this immediately so it was not to offend said Republicans\nUm you're absolutely right I mean have they ever read a book about the history of protest [laughter] yeah in this country\nSometimes I Wonder if they have and then I thought the remember that these are all kinds of toxic\nTo drawn by a in theory there is evidence that a\nDemocrat doing the same thing as saying we're going to go after our base those who believe that a true democracy those who the the power and you know a true right the multi racial society we're going to go after those boat\nFor some reason there are a number of Democrats who think our past the power is going to find people who have never vote for Democrats before or who only tried at one time instead of that could that be an energizing them that we know that actually went back to our country\nThis must have infuriated you are even more than me listening to Mitch McConnell said this to take\nA look I mean they've been after all of us who live shorter been under assault and everybody decided to stand up to the mall you know they're not\nThey're not being terminated bothers people I'm just couldn't be prouder among members for refusing to roll over on her all of this shouldn't come shore pressure always loved\n[noise] um so this is they didn't they didn't call the people in Charlottesville a mob the angry Nazis with torches put women trying to speak their truth and trying to be heard I mean you probably saw the tape of a Orrin Hatch literally with his hand like chewing women away and saying you know grow up\nI mean it it's hard to imagine them making it worse but somehow they have on every level have and they\nI mean like I was there ... you know George Wallace was\nSet up protesters and history of thought it would be completely on the wrong side and that will do that but he but Ronald and these cowardice Republicans as well but let's be clear that they are fundamentally like these women are not assaulting than it used that lake with about survivor of sexual assault it's got this kind of thing\nYeah they're they're ... they're rich white men to control all three branches of government but somehow there the the uh the aggrieved party here they're the victims\nYou know this is what we want to encourage people to do I know the country with food when they saw on a Maria odd and Maria Gallagher in that elevator talking to us lake but what folks understand\nIs that there were hundreds of other women who have taken that exact same type of action maybe not in the elevator and maybe in a stairwell in a hallway at an airport at a coffee shop in front of people's houses that\nHundreds of women had taken that act of bird dog before it ever went viral with ana Maria Maria\nAnd so you know we are really encouraging people to make their voice heard you know we made thousands of called people showed up at blue thousands of miles to try to have a meeting with their senators and they would not eat with us they would not answer calls they were giving their constituents to run around\nThat was a tactic in that they just life because it forces them to actually see their position\nWe'll turn their back on sexual assault
