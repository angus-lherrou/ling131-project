talk I'm going to talk of thank you uh really enjoy your show our town I'm a big fan but um I just wanted to talk a little bit about um the voter fraud or order election fraud Russia yeah lecture their election fraud\nAnd in Minnesota we have a pretty good\nA pretty good system um everything is on paper and um\nSo it's paper ballots and we don't really have a problem at the polls as much because you can set up a lot of polling stations for each um optical scanner right so it runs pretty officially and then we'll\nYou're not you're not a ... if you have a lot of people show up you can go from ten polling stations to thirty polling stations in in thirty seconds simply by passing out more papers\nWhereas if you're voting machines you're limited to the number of voting machines which is\nThat was a little game when I Lived in Atlanta that was a little game that they played a down there was ended up in the poor and black areas Ali they get the older machines but they got very few machines\nSo you'd end up with you know five hour long lines whereas in the white suburbs where I Lived there would be you know ten twelve machines and Fifteen people on line I mean it was just a you know and nobody in line functionally um after you bill\nYeah um and another thing we have here is you know just to to combat the whole purge problem as we'd have same day registration so if somebody moves and they need to register at the last minute or something or a you know to foreign of idea and um\nThey're registered yeah yeah oh that's great\nI mean you know what's a combination of the two um nobody can\n... yeah\nThat that is marvelous bill we should do that in every state in the\nOil and one other thing that they do just to make sure that the optical scanners are working because of course that's a machine\nBut in other people have to fill out the ballot the the machine doesn't fill up the ballot for you right so um you know other people fill out the ballot and then they do random audits at a different polling stations all across the state and find out is there any discrepancies between the final out that they they call in\nAnd uh the actual number on the scanner yeah that'll make him identify a problem very quickly and then they can drill down on it\nThat's all good election integrity stuff Bill thanks so that adds up out of that\nOr what would be a problem with passing a law I'm\nNationwide where all national races or have to have a system similar to ours\n[noise] me the problem would be that the constitution gives the power to regulate elections to the states\nAnd uh to a large extent and so you can pass federal standards\nYou can pass federal guarantee is essentially and and usually a tie it the money is with the help America vote act it it was tied to a six billion dollar appropriation\nTo give to the states to by voting machines back you know when when that happened in two thousand two out of the Bush administration let's let's have every every state in the in the country start using electronic voting machines from from our good Republican companies um but I I don't think that the federal government has the power to do that right now\nUm but if we if we were to amend the constitution and grant a federal right to vote or if we had a progressive Supreme Court and they simply you know knowledge the right to vote I think all that would change Bill thanks for the call it's great to hear from you or skip and Asheville Massachusetts they skip what's up\nWith the first hour and was getting a little upset about how many votes are being stolen and I'm thinking of voting might not be enough\nWith all the last vote yeah and um so I mean we always talked about revolution would be when the poor and the rich difference became really great and it seems like it's pretty big now and is it time now [laughter] [noise]\nWell I think I think you're watching a political revolution which is what brain are always very carefully use that phrase or a a shooting revolution or a secession kind of revolution would be extremely counterproductive right and I had to get more\nLike money boycott because they take the money we give them and fight us\nYeah except that you know most of the products that for example Koch Industries are the Koch brothers on don't have the word coke anywhere on them you'd have to walk around with a giant shopping list and even then you know it's just you know ah\nI looked at go ahead I looked at up once yeah and like every fabric oh I Know every insulation in all your coat and all the cool Mac materials all that stuff has them but I mean yeah there's got to be away just by cotton well have you know\nA yeah except it's just the the the ... typically boycotts don't work and and the reason why is because people have to live and they've got to spend money and they're not they don't spend that much time you know being\nFocused on those things that's why I'd rather than putting all of our efforts into an economic boycott I think we need to be putting all of our efforts into voting registration drives and get out the vote activities and when you get a bunch of Democrats like passing laws that\nThat will undo all his voter suppression skip thanks for the call I mean it is at the end you know the one of the revolution come as it were the political revolution is a good conversations or didn't question what's happened after the election\nWas a better handle on thanks so much for being with us today will be back tomorrow same time same place and in the meantime don't forget
