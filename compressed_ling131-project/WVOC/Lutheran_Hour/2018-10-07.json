we still want your money working for you as much as possible so maybe we have a smaller amount of money in cash you know maybe you like to have an actual cash you know in a safe and you're home maybe a little bit in savings and checking out a local bank\nMaybe you have a little bit in an online banks have FDIC insured that's being a higher interest rate and then where can we go after that well if you have equity in your home we may want to consider a home equity line of credit that you can borrow against an emergency a reverse mortgage is a possibility you can have a a line of credit\nAs a reverse mortgage that you would not have to make payments on\nAnd then the other thing is there are some types of savings and investments that are not requiring you to tie up your money for a long time but maybe can offer a higher yield and so we try and do in this example Jen is helping you maintain as much flexibility is you need\nJust trying to squeeze more return out of that money and you know for some people that want to be conservative and leave a decent chunk of money in something you know very safe that can be pretty big difference as far as the returns so that's just one example that I Would use as far as different areas of flexibility the other point that I Would make is you want different sucks points or flexibility\nPotential based on the more significant decisions you're making your life so the date of your retirement or things like that certainly wouldn't have flexibility with those assets\nAnd usually you have that that might be when you make your pension decision it might be when you're deciding what to do with your four one K.\nSo those are all really important to have and it ties in beautiful Egypt and if you hire a retirement player to help you we love to do is start a relationship with you\nAnd then help you all the way through so if you've not retired yet help you figure out what that plan is supposed to look like and then help you all the way up to that transition into retirement and then through retirement as well and that's really the most gratifying thing for us because we get to see you living the retirement of your dreams we call the custom built retirement plan in the very first step\nTo putting that together is taking advantage of a no cost new obligation retirement review\nWhich you can get started by calling right now at age ... three nine retire we'll look at the big picture talk to you about your needs but really about your once in your goals and dreams for retirement and help you put together a plan if you said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and mentioned the show to claim one of the ...\nThat we have reserved for today's listeners at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three\nEight four seven three\nYou're listening again he said your retirement with pets through the patch the founder of preservation specialists\nI'm generally jak alongside pat just gave me the phone number the website is retire with pat dot com\nIf you'd like to learn a little bit more today we are designing a blueprint for financial house looking at\nSome of the different components that need to be included so it will stand the test of time it is built to laugh when we include all of these different elements pat what is the final pillar or final components that we should make sure we include in our financial blueprint\nBut in a this is another one where I Am going to get on my soapbox that was really the pillar of this kind of the mortar that holds all these various parts together and that is an actual comprehensive plan pull all this stuff together and we mean by that as it is a plan to consider what your goals and dreams and vision is pre retirement\nIt's going to consider your assets any deaths you might have to consider your income it's going to consider how to help protect you from all those different risks we've talked about earlier it's going to consider those different areas of investing we talked to him because you need growth but you also need preservation and you need income that's how retirement is so much different\nThan when you're investing when you're younger there's all those various facets to it and then once you have all of that put together now you have that plan you need to implement the plan and the need to manage the plan\nSo that's where we think it's such a difference first of all if you just buy a retirement plan from someone you still need to implement it and then you need to manage it over time and then a lot of times a lot of people that are industry are just investment advisers and they may be very good at that\nBut it just doesn't make sense to us and that's why our clients love our structure because we are trying to pull it all together because your investments are incredibly related to your income in retirement which is very related to your taxes so that's why I Would say and having a comprehensive retirement plan is the eighth pillar\nSo it's not the best idea to build a home without the help of some sort of architect or contractor some sort of expert my final question for you today Patty is what's your take on people trying to build a financial house for retirement on their own without some of that guidance you were just referring to\nWell we all have different personalities we have people that come to us that have worked with other financial professionals we have a lot of people who haven't so they've kind of put their head down and said you know what I'm going to plow money in the four one K. and they're not going to read up on retirement stuff maybe they come to one of our retirement classes and that's how we meet\nSo a lot of times they're just thinking okay it's time to get serious maybe I Need to talk to a professional\nWhereas someone else may have worked with a number of people over the years I Would say that it's not that it's impossible to do yourself but the question is you need to ask yourself are do you have the time to do all the research to understand all these various areas 'cause it's a lot more than investing sometimes you'll have interest in investing\nBut there's a lot more to it than that and the second piece is do you have the interest in is that really what you want to be doing in retirement that's probably the biggest change I've seen Jen in my career I found ten or Fifteen Years ago more people that are more interested in that you know going back to my career spans back to the day traders and people thought oh you know what I'll do I'll sit at a computer all day\nI'll make a bunch of money you know you don't hear that any more but I Hope it didn't fare well for most people so I'm not of the school of thought that it's impossible however and that's what I Would ask yourself is\nDo you have the time to devote to doing it right because you only get one chance at retirement and you better not mess it up\nAnd then number two is that how you want to be spending your retirement those are things you need to be asking yourself\nOf course we're a little biased because this is what we love to do are passionate about it we love building those long term relationships with our clients and kind of helping the them through retirement or if they're already retired just helping reduced their fears and stress and helping them kind of create that plan\nIt's going to do all those different things to find someone that is a true planner that comprehensive\nAnd its independent those are the pieces that can help you build that retirement plan of your dreams\nAnd ultimately what we're trying to do is help you sleep well at night and do the things in retirement that you want to do that is where we started this show and that's where we'll finish it\nFind the things that your vision your goal and dreaming retirement and spend your time there that's why we do the retirement plans we create and that's why we offer the no cost new

disease that will keep them requiring care for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active\nCitizens even though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away it isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today\nAnd until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock is at times looking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image oh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above all others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see\nAll were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves that so much that he wants that all would be saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore\nWe have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not and as Christians\nWe cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his word to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia\nIs also the same sure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives\nYet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose we may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is you see God is a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow yet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us\nSent his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own defects maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident\nRegardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive love and return following him we can expect is sinful\nBroken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understandings of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow\nYou are listening\nAnd you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taking a life and now find yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain\nI encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the double once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age\nAnd in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior seats to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also\nMay we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purpose is God declares us to be for the whole children our heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMay we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them but there is nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his son\nTo save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life\nThat never ends me that piece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus Christ in his name we
