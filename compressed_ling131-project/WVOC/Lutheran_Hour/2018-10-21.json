{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And that's all we're here to help you do and take all the things you've been working on you've been building\nWhich is so important and so valuable that you've been doing but let's take the four one K. is take the Social Security benefits let's look at the timing of when you want to retire and let's put all those pieces together and build a plan and the foundation of that plan is you're written retirement income plan if you don't have a written retirement income plan or if you haven't looked at a long time\nI Would urge you to give us a call right now at eight o three nine retire we offer you are absolutely no cost new obligation five step retirement review\nAnd part of their retirement review is taking a look at your retirement income plan or helping you build your first retirement income plan once again that number's eight oh three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a tire a\nCall now never first get a second opinion and if you don't have one yet it's never too late to get started calling out into three nine retire\nTalking today with hats derby he's the founder of preservation specialists than I'm generally jak alongside retire with pat dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more ... what if we like part of our retirement intend to be guaranteed what should we be thinking about for guaranteed income\nWell certainly I think everyone wants to at least part of it guaranteed right Jim so we need to think about what's included in that category\nAnd think of it again as we're looking at your goals and figuring out what's going to cost to accomplish those goals now we're figuring out how we're going to generate the income to cover that so that's going to come from for most people Social Security\nFor some people a pension as well so both of those generally usually have some type of guarantee backing them and then the question is is that enough and for the vast majority of people the answer is no so there's a gap there right so how are we going to cover that gap and again for most people\nIt's covered by their nest egg so we want to encourage people if you think of the three worlds of money we don't want to cover that gap from the growth money's money in the stock market and mutual funds we want that to be kind of your long term growth money where we want to pull it from the other two areas which is the safe and guaranteed world or the steady income\nBut steady income isn't guaranteed so coming back to your question that leaves the safe guaranteed world\nAnd for most people the idea if there's a gap there and they want to have something guaranteed that's where ... can come in because you know there are a lot of different kinds of annuities but certain kinds of annuities can have tremendous guarantees built in and that can be incredibly valuable in the circumstance\nAnd we do have a little bit of time here before we get to the end of the show so why don't we talk a little bit more about the kinds of annuities and what we should be thinking about when it comes to cue perhaps using one and our retirement plan\nYeah so there's a lot of different kinds of annuities out there Jan and it often is considered you know kind of a taboo subject and I often hear there are a number of things in the finance where someone might say well I've heard of that term and I know someone that got burned by it or I Know I've seen articles telling me it's a bad idea in ... he is a big one\n'cause there's a couple of different kinds of annuities that people have been burned older style annuities sometimes we're what we called irrevocably which means you put your money in and then you all of a sudden you lost total control and that's certainly not the kind of annuity that we would think is appealing today\nOn the other hand there are types of annuities that have tremendous layers of fees in them and there are a lot of people that advertise against annuities these days and that's what they're referring to\nOur annuities have one or two or three or four layers of fees at my costs three or four or five percent a year\nTo the investor certainly something with such layers of fees is not something that would be appealing so when we were talking about is an annuity and for most of our clients what they're looking for something that has some kind of safety of principle so they know they're not taking risk because they're\nIn the main thing we're really usually looking for Jen is do we have the ability either now or down the road to turn on some kind of guaranteed lifetime income and you know you and I I Believe in the last segment we were talking about what if we live a really long time and the technical term we use for that does longevity risk\nSo if you we live a really long time how do we make sure we never run out of money well one of the few tools that protects you against that is an annuity that offers a guaranteed lifetime income so\nThe way that we use those if you think about a married couple we usually want to have an annuity if it's inappropriate fit for them and not all of our clients certainly use the new it is but if it's a fit for them\nWe went to allocate some money to that safe guaranteed basket of money and it's gonna be the ... where the principal has a guarantee from the company and then at some point we can turn on income is going to be guaranteed for as long as both or at least one of those spouses is living\nAnd that can provide a tremendous amount of comfort knowing that you can't outlive that money\nAnd again and you know a lot of times and meeting with people who were fifty five or sixty and you know we're running projections we're looking at it and you think about when you're eighty eighty five or Ninety and sometimes I'm going to laugh and say you know that's the least of my worries right now\nWell that's okay but at least a your worries but my job is to make sure you never run out of money right so this isn't something that you are piling all of your money into but what it can be as a piece and that's where it can be an appealing\nOpportunity for you to kind of begin allocating in those three different worlds and having a lifetime income guaranteed to one piece can be very appealing for a lot of people\nApparently have just a couple of minutes left in our show today do you have any final comments you'd like to share with us as we start to wrap things up\nWell I think you know we were laughing a little bit in the beginning that wouldn't it be nice if we were trying to figure out when can I retire or how much is going to cost me to retire how much do I need to save for retirement shake a magic eight ball and for it to give us a simple answer but of course life's never that easy is it we\nAll loved to have an easy button on her desk but that's not the way it works so I think this was a really valuable topic to discuss today helping you figure out the different steps involved and again we really need to make sure we know what your retirements going to look like what are your goals what are your dreams what's\nYour lifestyle going to be are you a home body are you in a world traveler do you want to eat out every night do you want to spend your time volunteering for ... for charity course for many people it's a mixture of all of those things but helping you figure out what that lifestyle is going to look like I mean that's a fun process to really think through\nThen that helps us figure out what that is going to cost and then we can kind of assess what your assets are to help you build that retirement and that's the whole idea is building you a written retirement income plan from the ground up it's personalized and customize specifically just for you\nAnd that can have tremendous power not only could help you retire successfully but it can give you tremendous peace of mind to know that you have a plan in place and that you're on track towards accomplishing those goals so we don't\nAnd like that yet give us a call right now at age ... three nine retire we call her as a custom built retirement plan because we are accustomed building it for each individual clients\nAnd what we're doing is offering that to you is they we call it five step retirement review it absolutely no

Marta ... news radio five sixty delegate\n\nBut for those who are cold weather Jews are gentile as price the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology\nI'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us ministry cigarette Lutheran our ministries the rapid pace of technology is nuts slowed it all has it\nI I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm out in the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we\nDidn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know kind of multiply their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out I had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need\n'em [laughter] and now today you know\nHow it's got a permeated everything's so yeah a technology I think is a an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also brings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm a someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith a thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program and that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is\nThe goalposts really never move [laughter] you know it's a a Jesus has already kick the ball and and that game has been one of 'em and for us\nThe message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here for you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he once you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and wild things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic it's something that's happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes a difference\nAnd in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have God\nOh and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a ... not only beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from soon\nWe are connected to that death\nSo in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms\nThe real question that we should be asking is is how does God see us\nAnd God sees us in Jesus our identities him in him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at us he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us and he cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message\nThat ah that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the why is this person in the world would not have come up with this as a solution to the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay\nSin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that Jesus in in that son of God in his sacrifice is somehow a toning for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academic\nOr treat it like math or science or ... you know something like that in dissect it in the end you kind of step back from it and go wow that is not how I Would have thought about that that's that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is that God's solution\nFor a problem that transcends our ability to cope with it\nAlso has to transcend our ability to cope with it so I got I had to provide a solution that was so beyond us that in many ways I just kind of really stand in awe of what the gospel is and the depths that he went through and what that meant\nFor Jesus I can only barely begin to kind of grasp it that you know I I read the Bible and I I Try to imagine what would that be like\nAnd of course I I Can't put myself in in Jesus you know shoes at that point or you know that he would die and then he would take on the sins of the world and and uh that he would descend into hell in you know for claimed victory things like that\nSo I just have to stand back and I just say you know I Believe it but I don't understand it and in many ways when people say that sounds like foolishness I just said yeah you're you're right but it's not really about understanding it from a logical perspective for me it's about face\nAnd face is a trust and its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection\nIs sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can\nI trust in it may be another way of saying that same thing is\nTo say that the the cross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is and who fence it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's also an offense to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nYeah I in the passage that was the basis for our techs were today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on\nAnd that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in in hurts them crushes them kind of thing and so that is the gospel I mean it's foolishness but it but it is an offense\nAnd it's interesting because today\nPeople are very very concerned about a fence and offending others in in from our research we found that one of the main reasons why people are apprehensive", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour",
