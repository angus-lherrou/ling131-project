{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And so you want to know how are they getting paid way in where's the money goes sometimes the mutual fund company makes the fees sometimes to brokerage makes us the sometimes the advisor makes iffy sometimes their manager makes to feed them and there can be so many layers in there and it's not that you're saying you want someone to work for free for you you just want to understand what you're paying ... is it reasonable\nAnd that's something that I don't think anyone can really argue with\nAnd so it's really all about just understanding what your options are in getting to the bottom of it and if someone tells you there are no fees or so you don't have to worry about that is just a red flag because\nEither again there's something being hidden or maybe they don't even know and those are kinds of things that you want to watch out for so one of the areas that we look at when we do at no cost new obligation retirement review in addition to all the other areas of your retirement planning but we can look up and do a fee and houses and take a look kind of under the hood\nAnd rather than just looking at a statement that just has an account value we can actually research that and see what kind of fees there are and believe me we've seen a wide range we've seen people paying enormous fees four or five percent a year management fees and some of their accounts and we've seen people that are also paying close to nothing\nSo it really there's an enormous range in our industry and so valuable to get that information so you can make educated decisions for yourself\nTo get started and take advantage of that new costs new obligation offer costs now eight oh three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement costs now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show to take advantage of that free offer once again it's a two or three nine retire\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak along side in the studio if you miss that number it's eight oh three\nNine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nPat I think we are ready for the final item on your checklist were going through some ways to help determine if you're getting it sound appropriate\nFinancial advice for your transition into retirement ... what's the last item on the list\nYes didn't lucky number seven is a assessing whether you're currently on the right track financially for retirement this is something that sounds pretty basic but you know a lotta times especially if you're working with someone who's more of an accumulation advisor\nThat they're just thinking about how do I make this pile of assets as big as absolutely possible which again is valuable it's good to have someone doing that but there's so much more right you need to figure out okay now that I'm accumulating whatever I've done over the last ten twenty thirty plus years\nHow do I turn that into a retirement plan\nAnd those are two wildly different things in the piece of the gym that I think is really important is you love to have a financial planner who gives you good news\nAnd I love being that financial planner I Will tell you I Love sharing good news but sometimes the news is an ideal him actually working with a client were in the early stages of their planning\nAnd when we did their first analysis it was very challenging and I was not looking forward to sharing that information because there was a big gap between what they wanted to accomplish and what the resources you have I give them all the credit in the world and I said you know you've done a lot of things well you're just trying to accomplish more than the resources you have\nAnd I said let's talk through that and they really took it so well now if we do want to retire earlier\nWhat changes do we make what do we do how do we look at our budget\nHow do we look at where we're spending our money do I want to work longer or do I want to retire and work part time\nAnd so we start kind of walking through all the different possibilities and so it goes from what I was concerned about being kind of a negative conversation to really it was uplifting for me 'cause we're back to problem solving and helping them figure out how to accomplish as much of their goals as we could\nAnd you know pat I think I Want to play out before we get to the end of the show here for some people they might need to change what they're\nDoing now because they've been getting inappropriate advice but because they haven't been getting any advice at all maybe they've been trying to just do this on their own do things and sounds and they found themselves\nGoing down the wrong path what do you think\nI think you're a hundred percent right and we have a lot of clients that come to us from other financial professionals but we have a lot of people that handle things themselves\nAnd it's really more of that you know something goes off in their mind maybe something happened to their life maybe they start seeing downsizing in their company or maybe with friends or maybe someone has a health issue and it's just that realization that okay it maybe it's time to get serious about this and I will tell you the gym a lot of times those people have done\nGreat job of you know accumulating assets now it's just about kind of taking that one piece that they've done a great job of in now fitting that into the rest of the plan so maybe they've done a great job of accumulating four one K. accounts investment portfolios maybe even pension benefits and the next day\nThey're kind of thinking about Social Security time they're thinking about their insurance but they don't really know how to put any of that together and so we can kind of come in and it's not necessarily that they've done everything horribly wrong it's just that it's going from some kind of a simple kind of that you know blinders on accumulation to having a real plan\nPat or just about out of time on our show today do you have any final comments forests or anything you'd like to leave our listeners less\nWell I think you know we talked about seven different things that I think are really really valuable Jan and the other thing that I Would sum it up with is and people may think this is kind of a flip and response but this is again just seeing it over the years when you are trying to figure out who to work with\nHow to do your retirement planning if you want to go it alone if you want a professional and if you're shopping or you know meeting with different people\nOne of the things you always want to do is trust your God\nIf you have an opportunity to meet with someone once or twice there should be a feeling there that they're conveying information to you that you want to know that you need to know if I shall professional is pushing a product to you your gut is probably telling you well even if that product sounds good if they're not helping me understand my plan\nThere's missing piece there right and we always tell anyone who comes into our office window we're not perfect for everybody sometimes we have someone come into our office who wants to be really really gross minded and aggressive with they're investing that's not really us you know what we want to do is going to help you grow your money if we can\nWe really want to do is preserve it and make sure you that income coming off of it as well and finding that balance and so there is no one perfect advisor or a company for everybody so it's about really kind of doing your due diligence and then when you talk with somebody\nTrust your gut if you have a good feeling about how that process goes we have found that quite often that that just works out very very smoothly and that gender is the reason we offer\nOur retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation because we want you to have the opportunity\nTo sit down with one of our retirement planners and see if there's a a good connection there and see if you think that our skills and our expertise is a match for what you're looking for sort of take advantage again absolutely no cost to no obligation called eight oh three nine retire\nIf you've said at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and

God combined with love of God with that kind of personality you can draw close to God as he has drawn close to you\nYou're perfectly content to go along with God with faith and fear and love producing a new maturity without really healthy outlook on life that's what Martin Luther was talking about when he explained the ten commandments we should fear and love and trust in God above all things\nWe should fear and love God that we may tame our cursing and swearing and crabbing and sharp and filthy times we should fear and love God that we may offer him acceptable worship and praise\nWe should fear and love God that we may honor respect love and obey every proper authority including parents\nWe should fear and love God that we may stop murdering people not simply with guns and knives but with a loving and hateful words and deeds\nWe should fear and love God that all of our thoughts words and actions may be sexually pure and clean which should fear and love God that we may not engage in the grand larceny or slander whereby we Rob people are very good names\nWe should fear of God that we may not craven covered what we can never own or possess we could live that way in fear of God and a lot for God we can do that by faith which is born at the foot of the cross of God son Jesus Christ\nThat's why we will not fear citizens we know God and we will not be given to the fear that destroys\nThere is a river the streams where oh show make glad the city of God holy place of the Tabernacle is of the most high God is in the midst of her she shot and not be moved God show

Lutheran our and we just heard a classic message from Dr Oswald Hoffman talking about the connection between faith and fear joining me here now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook\nDirector of us ministries here at Lutheran our ministries Tony let's talk about fear in our lives and how face interact in intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back to um I think if I'm remembering correctly about when I was seven ... and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have night terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream that that happened every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from the stream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half a week and half asleep and I would see\nThe shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was a I had a closet that didn't have a door so dark um\nAnd I had a a Barney Rubble night late Wednesday night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it helped and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows in the wall but ... what happened is I was going through this period of when it went to sleep I Would have this dream\nAnd I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating\nAnd I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things away [laughter] and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now and lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer and so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers\nThey would make a brick and I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it's like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear\nAs well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it actually probably wasn't that bad bad of a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that I had these kind of foreboding fears and and how he handled it\nAs you look back on that as an adult do you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with prayer it as a as a\n... a lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realize that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious o F anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that\nMost of the time still oddly enough I I used prayer when I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off those worries and those concerns especially when I'm trying to sleep\nPrayer is about the only effective way for me to to do that so it it's carried along with me this this whole time so it's it's more than just apply attitude in it actually is is is powerful yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
