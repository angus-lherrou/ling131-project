today with pets truly he's the founder of preservation specialists Pat's been going over the most valuable assets\nYou had heading into retirement some of them are tangible some of them are very much what you think your different retirement accounts maybe your real estate property is some of those are the things on your most valuable listed assets others are a little more intangible your health\nKind that you have ... what's the final item on our list of most valuable assets or retirement\nYeah it's in the last one I have is advice and as I think about this one comes to my mind is Twenty one years of experience and how to night and day difference anyone listening right now think back to Nineteen Ninety seven when I started okay\nSo if you had a question about finances it was really helpful to have an advisor that you could talk to because it was hard to get information that we're we're talking you know the early stages of the Internet we've got dial up you know maybe the dialects out are you and yeah you know you can't get through to AOL and all that kinda stuff\nWill manner we spoiled now you know they used to be you could just go to Google and now you can ask\nSyria relax or whatever you want to do to get these answers for you\nSo it's so different now Gen that it's really\nWe are in an age of information overload and you know we talked to a Social Security on the show today and you say well I'm going to Google wish I'd take Social Security and you're gonna get literally millions of searches\nFirst of all who wants to read all that and who has time to and and also how do you know it's reputable so that's where we believe it's left just kind of giving information to you and now it's about building a trusting relationship it's about having somebody that you have a real relationship and that's why we love\nHelping you build a retirement plan and then helping you execute the plan\nAnd then make the appropriate adjustments over time and now you a long term relationship with somebody who knows who knows what you were looking to accomplish\nThat's where I think it can be such an enormous difference from what a financial advisor would do Twenty years ago in the last thing I'll mention about that kind of tie it back to where we started is the other idea was so much information you may be able to get that information but it could take notice a lot of time\nAnd is that what you want to be doing is that when you think of your dream retirement is it okay now I'm going to block off Monday's spent all my time researching investments in the economy and interest rates and things like that\nFor someone who comes in and hires us the answer's definitely no they want to understand the plan they want to have a relationship with us and talk through things but then when they are outside of the officer not worrying about it and so they know it's in good hands and so those are a couple of thoughts I think could be valuable\nAnd I think that's important path to talk about the information overload that's out there because as you said things are so different today than they were back in Nineteen Ninety seven that technology that's available today we have these programs\nNow these robo advisers all these online investment platforms where we can really try to do this on our own\nBut you're still saying maybe that's not the best way to go right\nWell I think ... the term robo adviser has become a huge topic in our industry any time someone asked me if I'm worried about better fearful of it I say not in the least because there's not a single person that we work with\nThat is looking to replace us with a robot or we have a real relationship it's not some type of algorithms that has spread sheet\nNow I don't think that a robo adviser isn't necessarily the worst thing in the world if you're looking for something that's incredibly cheap and you know straight forward especially you know maybe when you're younger maybe at ... advisory is a great thing\nBut if you're investing ten thousand dollars when you're in your thirties early forties\nThat's a very different scenario than maybe accumulating two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million dollars or more and you're about to retire maybe that's a time when you want to have a real relationship with someone who actually understands you and what you're trying to accomplish and then the other part I Would say is\nTying that investment plan to all this other areas and that's where I think ... the things we're trying to do are so different than what a robo adviser is\nPatty had any final comments for us today on most valuable asset for retirement\nVillage and there was a fun topic and I think uh like you mentioned there are very typical things on there like for one case in IRAs but there are things maybe you wouldn't have thought of and I think time an advice or two of those\nHow do we make the most of your time or we don't know how much we have and how do we make sure you're getting good advice from someone that you can trust and those are the things that we at preservation specialists are just passionate about\nTwenty one years in industry and getting to know our clients over time and realizing just how valuable those relationships are we go through life cycles with our clients when a parent or a spouse passes away we're experiencing that

our lives and the finances are probably not the most important thing but they're still important and we want to make sure they get taken care of properly all of that is about having a long term

day Harold had enough again he hears that voice in his head\nHarold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens utility no I'm not encouraging you stupid boy so shut up and leave\nMe alone even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you ... here that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trans pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggle the more you only hurting yourself the more you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nUnit versus a an accident of on guided evolution from\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending\nI Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living and so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nIt gets worse now you and I have\nTo bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on avoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him and so on this particular Wednesday evening as Harold waited for the bus\nHis watch suddenly stopped the U.S Harold watch trust him into the mythical path of

and just believe part about God being your author\nIt's true there's another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late\nHour author is not limited to one way author character relationships are authors not a solitary and moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father\nBefore even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a give and take relationship with his son in in the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much she loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but he's adopted son his adopted daughter\nHe justified your existence not because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship\nFather son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the named Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters in this strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as gospel loving children in his death he showed us how to express doubt with a job like face my God my God why have you forsaken me he said\nFather into your hands I commit my spirit loop twenty three forty six and in his resurrection of Jesus showed us how

to describe that to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul when they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking them at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means\nTo be justified by grace along through faith alone in Christ along to the glory of God alone\nAmen amen\nYou're listening to the loose for an hour I'm Mark I assure along with Dr Tony cook and
