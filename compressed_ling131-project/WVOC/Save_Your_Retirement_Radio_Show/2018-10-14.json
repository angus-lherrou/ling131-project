{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "If he you know the red inflation that's of course on the the big terminal did you happen to pull that off and kind of look down and they are in the uh the cable itself was any of the copper wires corroded or anything like that\nUm as far as the the main one where\nRight where that's where they're not address sprayed spray all the spray on that sector letter okay and that that's where I tried to clean it off as much as possible\nOkay we now will say that we have seen uh a handful of vehicles or because of course those cable during the ... and all that stuff uh those cables wants to corrosion gets in there it is possible for that corrosion to follow the copper wires into the installation and it made me you know the wire may physically look OK\nI'm as time goes on in the ... uh the actual insulation for the wire make kind of gross or to speak [noise] um so I think really or what would benefit you is doing a voltage dropped test I'm I'm positive and negative side to see where your voltage drop is and of course you do that wall\nAnd also learning ... even though the batteries only a couple of years old I also do a test on the battery and the voltage dropped test\nOne quick thing I call it like a driveway test Bobby would require two people but you could turn the headlights on 'em and this isn't technical it also technician don't use this method but just kind of get you an idea what's going on somebody could watch the headlights you turn the headlights on an attempt to crank the vehicle over\nAnd of course if you see the headlights go completely out typically that means you just lost all your voltage like a voltage dropped\nIf the lights deem very low of course that could be a bad cell in the battery the batteries not swelling or anything like that is it's still you know nice and square you don't see a a swelling of the matter is oh okay yeah yeah try the headlight thing and then and really a low test would probably be the second thing and third thing would be a voltage dropped\nBut I notice when I first turn on a mission or is that very first clicks just starting to power on friday and start earning thirty yeah\nSometimes it doesn't lose their ... their ... when I actually turned over for all the lights are coming here that's right or a certain amount of those started and then when he said that's when it clears the\nYeah and there's probably enough battery voltage in there um for you know like you said when you turn to the access remote which is first click a you know they're probably not voltage into battery indoor that the voltage drop is president because it's not requiring a lot of average\nOr when you turn it to the next one to feel pump comes on chicken Eli comes on of course then the starter that's drawn a lot of average in any loose connection any corrosion voltage drops anything's going to show up when it's requesting or when it's when the am draws required I guess what I'm trying to say\nAnd I have noticed that that that that does not you know for hours on sometimes that it will have less less relatives I guess\nRyan says started yeah I I Can't I Can't tell them\nWhat does the ... meter vogue age say when you just key on [noise]\n[noise] um [noise]\nA darn good it's usually right sport have\nOkay so that's run and what about this key on not running\nAround and yeah [noise] [noise] um [noise]\nAbout probably twelve yeah and those cages are cost relative they're not exactly like digital accuracy or anything like that but\nUm yeah I still I think that'd be the next test of course the low test on a battery make sure it can actually handle it Sammy coal cranking answer you know the batteries capable of voltage drop 'em and of course you know that that between those two tests you're going to find that if you\nAre more likely that corrosion is in the cable is more or less a marketplace that cable out\nYou can uh though there's some shops including us of course have a an and that we can actually put on there that's just as good if not better than the permanent or the the factory one or two in preempt an insider and of course obviously\n... factory but it actually looks better than factory I'll be ... you know if you have enough slack for typically those or anything with it that cable normally there's enough a psychic\nI mean I'm I'm right here on Washington wrote a barbecue on something closer to yourself right here\nThat what they're opening our own over there [laughter]\nI worked in mines so well\nFor me is trying to get everything was seeing things you know the or\nWhatever I buy that help so I\nTake it on a Monday morning drop it off there for the day\nThat or I Bobby thank you very much for the phone call or thank you very much Rio\nYou okay let's go for the day I Will do it I dive or come to this\nCNC auto show what can we help you with\nThe morning I'm I have a rancher rebels interested in 'em and he calls it\nA lot more downhill driving yeah shall we\n[laughter] uh Dave ... definitely covered you know the kind of than the normal maintenance tune up stuff\nUh one thing that's overlooked a lot is the no to censor or an oath to censor is just like a battery and over a slow or a long period of time to go to censor becomes a slave labor like Lazio to censor\nOr when it's brand new switches at a very fast rate you know a up and down of course and then as time goes on switches slow and what that means is that your computer is getting an input very slowly and uh the computer's a course obviously adjusts the fuel\nAnd sparked a time and everything so the fuel trims are adjusting a lot slower to\nWhich you know of course over a long period of time that actually adds up to a good bit of a fuel economy so oh to censor wouldn't be a bad idea um and of course unfortunately that is if it comes out of the manifold because some of those did kind of stick\nIn season there hopefully you won't have that issue it wouldn't be a bad idea to put some penetrating all on it and drive it a few times and then put some more penetrating on there and make sure it's good and soaked in just to try 'em ... and again the normal maintenance to not be I mean even a PC valve on the vehicle or you know of course if it's\nIf it's pulling too much bird ... of course I can call\nUs he'll mention also the whole peace ... make sure the whole ... system as far as in good condition along with the button a PC we Ralph\nYeah um and then of course you can get into the the things that you know you could see more long term and short yeah that looks good [laughter] um you know increasing the pressure just a little bit of course obviously you're going to sacrifice a little bit of ride quality but\nUh it's amazing how much that helps even like we see some of the the hybrid vehicles of course with the hybrid or I guess designed tires are a little bit harder compound you know your fish in ours is a big thing it is yeah so you know increasing the pressure or just a little bit and you know not to the max or anything like that\nBut that would help um come on here and what else\nA a ... if you really want to get my news and it is yet but uh but anything to do with your normal ... airfield er and feel ... well that one to have a field so that actually might it might even if it if that would does have a field field or do that\nJust a normal might that's and that's what we found it works a lot better when you're forgetting what are your tips to always said okay well uh shed wait\nOh yeah yeah yeah those golf clubs out you know don't use it for a little bit of the jak you don't need to know what to do or delaying things die oh well thank you so much all try to get on that which I Do a study forests and let us know how much it increased yeah well I liked that idea that would be\nReally good John around we are pretty much about out of time are we going to the time clock so we need

[noise]\nIt's slowly inches upward\nSoon it reaches the top stops for just a second then it propels you down faster and faster\nWe have been experiencing a grapes climb in the stock market over the past few years when is it going to reach the ... when will it had downhill what might happen to your investment when it does you won't know unless you have a qualified\nFinancial advisors show you

preservation specialist\nAt eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five find out what you do now before a market correction let ... and the team at preservation specialist provide you with the information you need to make\nAn informed decision eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five that's eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five grand back has been interested in\nIs not a client investment advisor service is off the coast ...\nThanks for joining us today they said your retirement with pets ... generally jak here alongside ... he's the founder of preservation specialists you've seen pat and the local media you read his articles in USA Today and investors business daily\nHe joins me today as we talk about whether you're getting good advice for going through this checklist to help you determine if you are getting good financial guidance this is so important as you head into retirement one of the things you want to know is is the advice giver you're working with is required to put\nYour best interests ahead of their own self pat should we ask more from\nOur financial professional van upholding the fiduciary standard\nYes ah and in fact I heard a speaker say many many moons ago Gen if someone is giving you bad advice there's only two possible answers is because they don't know the right answer it where they don't care and he would always say well which one is better and the point being neither one is acceptable right [laughter]\nSo you need someone who cares which is the fiduciary standard because they're putting your interests first but then you also need somebody who knows it's my second item on the checklist is you need to determine if the financial professional who's providing you with advice\nHas the skill set in the know how to help guide you financially in the current phase of life you're in right now\nAnd if you're not retired yet into retirement and this is a topic that I Know we've discussed a little bit in the past I Would say early in my career Jen I I really wouldn't have realized how powerful and how important this was but this is something that I have conversations with clients about on a daily basis and it's not me bringing it up its people kind of saying\nThis is what's on their mind and the analogy I always use is\nThe overly simplistic one in our industry says there's two phases of your financial life there's accumulating while you're working and then there's\nTaking income in preserving when you're retired and I always say you know think of that accumulation phase just it you know do you think of like a horse a racehorse or they put blinders on them that's the best thing to think of\nIf you're listening to this and you're far from retirement and you're just trying to figure out how to put money in your four one K. or whatever just set it up with your employer put blinders on and then just don't even pay attention to just work and say work and say that's the key but it's you can't do that until the day you retire like that doesn't work so that needs to be a third phase and that's the transition phase\nAnd this is what we're talking about is do you have someone to help guide you through and this is where I get lots and lots of questions everyday jet which is where new I started that transition is it based on how old I Am how far from retirement how much I've saved accumulated\nA of course it's a mix of all those things and so this was that transition time that we think is incredibly powerful to help you make sure you're getting good advice to lead you into that retirement stage\nWell pat what skills and experience should we look for in the person who's going to help us with this transition phase for retirement\nYeah I think there's a number of them that come to mind for me and so what kind of walk through a few of those here uh one would be\nMost people when we're thinking of retirement planning the first thing that comes to their mind as their nest egg of their investments most people don't have the benefit of being able to just retire and say Social Security or social screen of pensions so they're living off of a four one K. or some type of nesting so that's where the again if you're a twenty five and putting your first dollar and you're four one K.\nHey that money's going be sitting there hopefully for a long time when you're trying to get close to retirement you got a lot more eggs in those baskets that you need to protect\nSo you need more of a balance and so it's figuring out how do you balance that and the example I always uses a loss on your nest egg at sixty five is far far far more damaging the thirty five\nOne thing most will pick up on right away as well sure I don't have as much time to make it up but the other point I always make is you've got a lot more at risk right you might have saved two hundred fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million or more when you're about ready to retire as opposed to early in your life when there's usually a lot of the roads [laughter]\nOn the account so that's the first one of the next one is keep in mind I don't hardly meet anybody who's gonna retire off of one stream of income where you've got money coming from one place so we really want someone that can help construct a retirement income strategy and take these various income sources so you may have Social Security\nIf you're married there's two different sources their four one K. accounts investment portfolios maybe have a pension or an annuity\nPiece all those together to make the most optimal income planned for you and then that ties into working with a CPA or\nWorking on your tax planning to help make sure that your minimizing taxes and then the last couple of areas would then be also kind of protecting yourself you know you want someone as well versed in the various types of insurance and retirement like Medicare supplements and long term care even life insurance ... one of the questions I get a lot as do I even need life insurance anymore\nAnd of course then you know the answer that is it depends on all kinds of actors and\nEveryone's situation is different and then the last piece is just it's a big transition going from accumulating the blinders on to retiring and so having someone helping you through that transition and understanding the different changes in maneuvers\nWe think it's just we've seen so many people see the value in that and that's why we offer to clients who hire us ah we help them put together what we call it custom built retirement plan\nAnd typically part of building that plant is helping with that transition helping you figure out kind of where you're at your stage of life right now and helping you make sure that you're right on track\nTo get started we offer an absolutely no costs new obligation retirement review to kind of take a look at where you are and talk about your goals and dreams and help you see if you're on track to get started called ... three nine retire it's available if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement give us a call right now it with three nine retire\nWe have a busy schedule the next couple of weeks but we block off meeting specifically for listeners of today's show sort of take advantage of that new costs new obligation retirement review call now at age ... three nine retire\nWe're talking today with pets droopy he's the founder of preservation specialists that number again ... three nine retire or eight oh three\nNine seven three eighty four Seventy three the website is retire with pat dot com if you'd like to learn more today we're talking about getting the right advice when it comes to making the transition to retirement\nYou should be getting good advice to guide you through what can be a complicated process so how do you determine if the advice you're currently getting is on the market and that it's appropriate to your situation pets taking us through this checklist you help us make that determination\nPat what set another item on your check list what else should we be thinking about\nWell or the next one I have Jen is making sure that any advisor or financial professionally you're working with is looking at the entire retirement puzzle and not just one piece of it and I'll use one specific example which is what we see all the time is\nSomeone who we work with a lot of people that maybe manage their own finances for most of their lives but if someone is coming from another financial professional a lot of the time\nThey went into that relationship thinking or assuming that that person or from was a comprehensive financial planner what they ended up happening is someone who is just an investment advisor\nAnd there's nothing wrong with just being an investment advisor I Know there are people in our town that are very good at that but the question is what what are you looking for and we really believe especially as you start to accumulate more and you're closer to retirement that's when that retirement puzzle becomes so incredibly important because it's not just about having a nest egg\nIs about all those different pieces fitting together into a cohesive plan so we want you to do well with your nest egg but that also needs to\nHelp you create an income plan and then you also want to be minimizing taxes on that plane as well so you don't want to have a financial professional that is really only focused on one aspect or one piece of the puzzle because they may not really be considering or even understanding how it's affecting all the other pieces\nDefault assumptions that I might think well there's these things might be best but\nWe always double check that to make sure right because sometimes things go according to plan sometimes there's a big surprise Social Security is a great example that I've told you Jen that I've learned over the years that until we run the numbers\nI won't have any idea what the recommendations would be our advisory team just earlier this week and we were going through the analysis and it just said something that none of us expected it\nYou know we're kind of numbers and financial ... we'll look and say oh wow that's really interesting you know I haven't seen that before but it's fun because we we're we're trying to do is obviously pulled together the best thing for that particular person and then once you gather that information is about designing implementing a strategy that connects to your goals one that's flexible enough\nTo accommodate the adjustments they're going to happen\nLater in life and I've got a kind of phrase I like to use gym that I think summarizes his entire topic and what's really really important and if you're talking to anyone whether it's in a casual conversation or sitting down with a financial professional just keep in mind are you hearing about product before plan\nThat is the one thing you need to be very cautious of because if you come in and say hey I'm retiring next year and they said oh man I got this great annuity it's going to be perfect for you well that's a big big time out that you want to put their okay 'cause they don't know anything about you and they're assuming that they have one thing that's the best thing for everybody\nAnd so what you really need to do is watch for that and see if they're looking at your plan overall or if they've got kind of this one thing that they think is the best thing for everybody in so we always want to be careful of product before plan and you want to always have planned first so that\nSounds like it's one red flag someone who's really pushing a sale other particular thing rather than pushing the process first any other red flags we need to be looking out for when trying to find the right advice giver\nYeah it's you know a few that come to mind Gen we were talking earlier about being a fiduciary and Syria of course doesn't mean that that plan or isn't being compensated dumb way one of the things they would do is certainly be open about that they just want to have transparency so you can have an honest conversation\nAnd understand what type of fees you're paying and how everyone is being compensated we like to talk about\nThe various ways that we can be compensated not only that but if we're helping Mitt any part of the nest egg how those investment companies being compensated because those are I think both extremely important and valuable for you know\nAnother one that's kind of a just a a broad generalization I Would say is just be careful of big promises if someone's telling you that can make you a huge return with no risk you know I think we all have the the idea of you know it'd be too good to be true if something sounds too good to be true you always want to ask questions and understand that I always say there's no perfect investment there's no perfect plan\nThere's pros and cons to everything and as a fiduciary what we're doing is you're planners were just trying to help you see both of those\nAnd then one other one that I thought of that I think is really important is\nYou want to you before you hire somebody just whenever an idea of what type of time is going to be available that you can expect the term that we always want to say to watch out for is what we call the quote unquote the hand off which is you know if there's a an advisor who maybe owns the company or the leaf advisor\nAnd kind of walk you through the first meeting or the first two meetings and then you're handed off to you know a college in turn or something like that uh for future means because they're off meeting new people\nAnd uh you know every advisory firm has their own process and we all have a limited number of hours you know in his you know I've got a wife and a three year old and a two year old so I Can't work eighty hours a week\nThe boss at the house would not happy with that and I wouldn't be there right so we all need to find a balance\nAnd said well we talk about with new clients is if there's financial planning questions if there's investment advice that we're discussing that's going to be with your advisor if there are things that can be done like changing how much money you're taking on a monthly basis are changing a beneficiary we have team members\nThat actually are better at that than the advisors are anyway so it's kind of we have found a way to leverage that is to really have a great team\nTo help you kind of handle everything that you need to handle and really all this comes back to that transparency of just understanding what you're getting yourself into and making sure that you're not having a misunderstanding with someone right from the beginning and again that's another thing that we always talk about the reason we offer\nThe meeting an absolutely no cost a new obligation to review your circumstances is to give you an opportunity to talk with\nA comprehensive retirement plan or to help get kind of meet them and get to know their personality and see if there's a fit there so to get started with that type of new ... new obligation review cause now at age ... three\nNine retire and there are a lot of things that we would try to look at when we try and put together that retirement review for you but we want to take a look at a review of where you stand in how close you already are goals\nWe want to look at how much risk you're taking a stress test your nest egg as you're transitioning getting closer to retirement and do you have an income plans set up if not we'll give you an idea what that would look like\nOnce again that number's eight oh three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show to get started that number once again as a two or three nine retire\nPets to be is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside eight oh three nine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three is the number we have been going through this checklist of items we need to be clear about to help determine if we're getting the right financial advice\nFor our transition into retirement pat what's another thing for us to think about what's another item on your check list\nThe next one I Would mention is are you following the formal written strategy for retirement one that has a lot of thought put into it research understanding it's personalized to you and then also\nHaving the flexibility to adjust to changing or unforeseen circumstances and what I'm Talking about here is a real documents that actually has stepped in strategies in there something that you can pull off the shelf or pull up on your computer screen and this is kind of designed to be the compass right we know what your goals are\nAnd this is kind of helping you make sure that you stay on that path and you know I've had this happen Jen where you know maybe if someone comes in starts working with us in their mid fifties one part of that plan is kind of the health care and insurance planning and that may be very low on their priority list when we get started\nWell maybe a few years later and maybe they have a parent or\nAnother family members that needs nursing care and suddenly that's on your mind and so you've got this peace of mind to know hey we've talked about that and we've got a plan in place that fits your circumstances and so that can be very helpful and then the other piece that I mentioned briefly there is we all know life changes so we have goals right now\nThey may be exactly the same as they were five or ten years ago or they might be ... miles and miles away and do all the different so\nHandling those curve balls that happened I was just meeting with a longtime client and he went in for a routine checkup a few months ago and they referred to a specialist and he ended up having to have open heart surgery and while that was a scary time for them we were actually meeting just a few days ago and they said you know thank God\nI we went in there because I might not be sitting here right now if we hadn't done that so there's big curve balls there that's affected their lifestyle it's affected you know medical expenses and things like that so making sure that we have a plan that has that ability to adjust of courses another valuable piece\nAnd having an actual written formal strategy is going to make a difference rather than just thinking about some of these things and having an idea of what you're going to do\nYeah you know I think for a few reasons Gen as we've seen this over the years one is life throws a curve balls at you and that can be personal family changes that can be the economy or the stock market you know if the markets crash or you have major medical problems we all left her own devices we might panic right\nSo by having a plan in a planner in place gives you someone to talk through that and make sure that you stay on track\nThe other thing that I found Jen is they're usually a couple of areas of the plan that are really important to someone when we're sitting down talking at that time and then there's often a couple of areas that are kind of on the back burner\nBut what people have told me it was just knowing that they have someone else looking at that with them and they have something written a document it just gives some peace of mind so I think there's those\nKind of in measurable benefits but then you also have you know the specifics when you have an income strategy we believe wholeheartedly that you can usually squeeze more income out of your different sources by making the most of them by having a plan for how you're taking that income\nFor many people were able to help them pay less taxes in retirement because we're helping keep them in a lower tax bracket for having a more comprehensive review of the various types of\nMedical insurance or various types of insurance plans quite often we can help reduce just the outgoing cost of those types of things and then of course really understanding does my investment strategy match my time in life\nMost people would tell you be as aggressive as your comfortable being when you are in your fifties and sixties and it's really important to take a look at that especially when you think about you know how high the stock market is right now we've done very well in the markets are everyone has 'cause everything's kind of a rising tide\nBut we know that can last forever so taking a look at how much risk you're taking\nAnd making sure that you can't have that huge crash right at the wrong time in your life not only can give you an enormous financial benefit but certainly can give you peace of mind to know that some place as well and then one of the last things I've mentioned is a this is another one that I see almost daily Gen which is\nPeople having done a great job of doing their own retirement planning and kind of pulling things together and they're bringing us kind of for that second opinion and one piece that we often see that isn't factoring in is inflation may cause if you live ten twenty thirty plus years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Save Your Retirement Radio Show", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
