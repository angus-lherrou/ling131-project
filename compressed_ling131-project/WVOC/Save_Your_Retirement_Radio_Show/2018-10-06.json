has more than Twenty years experience any investment in finance industry padded the author of the book said your retirement he'd seen him in the local media you read his articles and USA Today and investors business daily the website\nIs retire with pat dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more again that's retire with pat dot com\nSo today we are building a sound financial house for retirement and there are some elements that need to be applied to make sure you have a plan that will last are analogy today is thinking about some of those historic structures maybe castles\nYou've seen abroad or here in the United states some of the older structures older buildings that we have here\nWhat's the third pillar we need to solidify our financial foundation pat so we have a solid strategy for this next phase of life\nWas so we just talked about all the different assets that you have ... so the next thing then is protection for those assets that'd be the third of our aid pillars mhm and that's one I Love to talk about with a lot of new clients and people that were having conversations with because\nI think most of us understand there's a natural progression you know when you're in your thirties and forties you are just trying to accumulate\nStuff camera Dyarman you know whether that's a four one K. or Social Security benefits or whatever and then at some points for a lot of people with fifty fifty five or sixty that there's that mindset that says okay I Need to start thinking about protecting this now and the most common reason I get for that Jen is I'm closer to retirement right I'm older\nI you know I Need to be more conservative I Need to be thinking about that I've got less time to make it up\nBut the other point that I always like to make is I bet you got more stuff yeah right\nSo the time is accurate but the other thing is when you think about what happened when the market crashed in two thousand two thousand one and what happened in two thousand eight most people took a hit of some kind of there but now I wanted also go back and think about how much do you have\nIn your accounts in your investments now versus then and people that have been working hard accumulating will say well yeah there's more risk Claire\nSo even more so does that make it important that we do something to help you protect those assets you worked so hard for it\nLet's talk about some of the biggest risk we need to address pat whether the happier list\nWell just type in a beautifully done with my book save your retirement which is designed to walk you through seven retirement villains and as I was kind of lifting these off I was thinking yeah well that's a villain that's all right\nSo the one we just talked about is market risk and that is you know when you think about a generation or two ago\nA lot of people could retire successfully and didn't have to worry about a four one K. or investments or anything like that now most people retiring do have to worry about those things in the years right before and right after you retire are critical to make sure you avoid significant market losses so that would be one\nAnother one with the longevity risk which is the first villain in my book because of the fact that we all love to live long healthy lives but the fact of the matter is that means we have to have more money and have it lasts longer so that's a risk certainly healthcare costs can pose a big risk and then the other one that comes to mind is inflation which is\nIf we retire at sixty or sixty five and if we live in or eighties or nineties that as a tremendous amount of time for things to get more and more expensive and more than likely you are on some type of fixed income or very close to a fixed income so we need to make sure we're protecting your assets\nAnd your dreams of the vision that you have that retirement from all of those risks\nSo it's one thing to identify the different risks how do we go about actually protecting our assets I'm guessing there's a number of different strategy because all of these risks are so different\nYes that's absolutely true there's different strategies for each one if we can go through those taking market risk and example it's one of the biggest reasons people come to see us and want to talk with us and help them figure out are they taking the right amount of risk you know have they made that balance successfully or they transitioning from an aggressive\nGrowth portfolio or when they were younger to more of preserving and in creating income so really to protecting its market risk was really only two ways you can protect one would be to avoided altogether and the other would be diversification so what do I mean by ... well that means you've got all your money or four one K.\nAnd you're scared with the market's going to do and you slide it all into cash or something safe okay\nAnd we have people that have done that and maybe if you've accumulated enough and you're concerned about enough about the market and maybe that's okay for you for most people they need their money's still earning something because caches and earning anything so that's where diversification then comes in\nAnd that's the beauty of working with a comprehensive plan or is they can help you realize there's a lot more out there than what's in your four one K. C. four one K. is usually a limited to something in the stock market something in the bond market and then something safe like cash\nAnd there's a whole host of other opportunities out there none of 'em are perfect read there's no perfect investment out there but there are all different kinds of things to varying degrees of growth potential\nOf safety and then of access that you have and those are the three things we're always trying to balance so we can help you um determine what you have\nAn also look at all the things that are out there and help you figure out what the best way to defend against market risk is for you and then the second one gym that I mentioned is longevity risk which the bottom line there is as we talked about in the last segment you just have to have a written retirement income plan that's the bottom line you have to know where your income is going to come from\nI mean part of that is figuring out which sources of income are going to last your whole life you know like Social Security has a federal guarantee that's going to last our entire lives\nAnd while there are funding issues a significant issues with Social Security there is some type of guaranteed to that and thus far it has always been back to so that's an example of one of the options that are there and those are actually two perfect examples of\nWhat we talk about in our retirement reviews that we do with people that come to our office for the first time because there are all kinds of things that we deal with but two of the ones that are often of critical concerns that people are\nHow am I going to generate income retirement and how do I make sure I'm Still earning money on my nest egg but I'm protecting myself from risk so those are two of the big areas we just talked about those are two things we cover in our new costs new obligation retirement review so that would be a value cause right now at age two or three nine retire\nIf you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now it was three nine retire mentioned that you heard the save your retirement radio show today to claim one of the remaining spots we have once again it's a two or three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nWe're talking with pat ... today he is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside in the studio had just gave me the phone number the website is retire with pat dot com and if you'd like to learn a little bit more we've been talking about all of these risks\nThat are looming in retirement pat what's another pillar maybe a little bit more on the positive side rather than just the risk\nYes so uh obviously you know we want to talk about your assets we went to protect you from the risks of those for the next pillar we want to have is gross\nYou know we've already talked about generating income in retirement\nSo we also of course want your money growing so I've yet to meet with someone in my Twenty one years of experience that would be satisfied having all their money a checking account\nAnd then just drawing down through our retirement\nYou build up these assets and they should be working for you so\nThis is a great example gym that I like to talk about the three worlds of savings and investments because really one of them is purely for safety and the other two have varying degrees of growth so you have kind of you're safe guaranteed world which might be bank accounts it might be us savings bonds that might be annuities with guarantees\nAnd then you have the growth area which is usually things like the stock market and mutual funds and things like that and then there's middle world that's kind of in between so that might be something that you're not tied to the market but his designed to generate some type of income or growth combination\nSo there are three things left that would have some type of guarantee number one will be Social Security which again we mentioned briefly habits funding problems but it is still guaranteed by our federal government which is not a failed to pay that out\nThe date a number two would be some type of pension plan if you worked for a company or a government entity that pays that out and then number three would be any type of duty contract\nThat would have some type of income guaranteed to it so those are the three places that you can create guaranteed retirement income now does every dollar of your retirement income needs to be guaranteed know what a lot of people like to do is maybe have their gotta habits\nTheir absolute minimum paid by those things that can provide a lot of security\nAnd that's one approach to retirement income planning and that really depends on your personality and comfort level with those types of things I'm not everyone can do that and so that's where the beauty of the independent planning with your own retirement plan or who's going to customize a plan for you can be so valuable that how\nMuch income should we need in retirement Ken Harris Cuba\nFor retirement how how do\nIncome needs can change once we leave the regularity of our working years\nWell Jim this is one of those I really believe there are general rules and I'm sure you know you know Seventy to eighty percent of your pre retirement income is often thrown around as an income replacement number\nAnd we certainly have clients that fit right into that range but I Will tell you I have clients that you know we're talking about it and they'll say I can't imagine getting anything less than one I'm I'm living off of right now as an example I also have clients who let's say their goal was they're paying off their mortgage right when they retire\nSo now you think of all the things that are going the way they don't have the commuting costs they don't have their mortgage payments they are maybe plowing a lot of money into their retirement plans so they're not gonna be doing that anymore retirement and so they're looking at say I don't need nearly that much\nSo that's where you and I joke sometimes I don't like to call the budget but he's really just about having a general spending plan for retirement and there are two types of people in the world that I found there are people that love spreadsheets and already have that figure it out right and they say okay I'm going to spend you know Fifteen dollars and twelve cents on fast food this week\nAnd then there are people that you know the hear the word budget in their eyes kind of ... and they panic so\nSo your spending plan can be tailored in you know how specific it as it can be tailored to your interests as long as you know we're not in a kind of dangerous situation of you know you having to really skimpy in retirement\nHopefully our goal is for our clients in retirement can really kind of live their passion and do exciting things and fun things\nBut that's where it really can be incredibly valuable to have that retirement plan or working with you\nHelping you think about what that vision in what those goals are for retirement not necessarily to the penny but helping you figure that out and then of determining where that incomes going to come from and that's all about what we do in that retirement review that we love to talk about\nNow this is not some generic cookie cutter report it is customize specifically just for you all you need to do is call right now at eight o three nine retire\nWe certainly keep a very full calendar but we set aside opening specifically for listeners ups they show so call now at eight o three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now to reserve one of the remaining spots at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nPat ... is the founder of preservation specialist I'm generally jak along side in the studio pat what's the next Taylor if we are trying to build our financial blueprints for retirement what else should be included\nWhat'd you and I think we kind of teased on this one already which is you know the last one we talked about having income in retirement this next one is than protection for your retirement income some protection that if the economy is bad if the stock market's bad in your nest egg gets depleted what type of protection to you have it you still have money coming in every month\nAnd so where does that protection come from though\nWe have talked about three different areas that can come from that and one would be Social Security so what's going to guarantee that well it's the full faith and credit of the federal government\nNow my opinion is that the taxes that have been paid for Social Security have not been handled properly but that's neither here nor there we can't deal with that the good news is if your depending on Social Security that our federal government has the power to tax and the power to print money\nSo those are both on your side uh as far as the guarantee for Social Security\nNext would be a pension now what's your into your pension that's a really big question and you know early in my career Jen you know if you had a company pension everyone kind of just assumed it was going to be fine\nWell wow is that changed in the last two decades yeah I'm the vast majority of people that we meet with if they have a lump sum option for their pension they're almost always going to take it\nAnd the simple reason for that is companies are desperately trying to get out of those pension obligations and there are all kinds of strategies that can use to do so so he company pension or we would believe would be very different if guarantees\nThat government pension and of course we want to know the government pension what type of funding it as there are states like Illinois and California I Would be very nervous about ... Carolina's numbers are better than that\nBut we talked to a gym a moment ago about that idea of you know in a perfect world you know the things that have these guarantees we'd love to have them covering your necessities on a monthly basis and uh for some people may be Social Security and pensions might cover that but certainly not all people as you know\n... what are some of the options if you do have some sort of gap or shortfall why are some options for filling that are bridging that gap\nThey're limited Gen because when we are trying to figure out your retirement income we talked about eight different sources but we talked with only three that have some type of guarantees to them\nSo we've already covered Social Security and pensions if you have a gap there generally speaking the only viable option that has a guaranteed backing it is going to be some type of ingenuity that offers some type of guaranteed lifetime income in fact we've seen people in companies even call that a personal pension\nSo let's say for example and we've had this happen with a number of clients\nWho really like that idea of having some type of guaranteed to cover their absolute basic necessities in any given month and let's see as an example and say their Social Security and their pension covers most of their expenses but let's say there's a thousand dollar gap there so they are going to have most of their expenses their basic expenses covered\nThere is a thousand dollars a month still need to cover that well we can do is we can shop these guaranteed lifetime income annuity companies and say\nWho will pay the client a thousand dollars a month guaranteed for life\nAnd what would you have to deposit into this annuity to get that guarantees so we can chop it and find out essentially what we're doing is we're saying with the least amount of money from my nest egg I have to use\nTo generate that thousand dollars a month and of course it doesn't have to be a thousand dollars a month is just a simple example and the beauty of that Jen is when we're looking at all the different savings and investment vehicles out there when you have an independent plan or like we are\nWhose license to deal with anything we can shop anything and and figure that out so if we get a number back from the new the company\nAnd you look at it and we look at and we say that's really good that seems like a great fit for you and it's only using a portion of your nest egg then we can run with that if we get that number back and we don't like that number then maybe that's not the right fit for you or maybe it's not the right time for you to do something like that maybe you're younger and mapped just doesn't work in your favor so there's a lot of variables there\nWe think there's an enormous value to having not only someone who is independent who can help shop for you and find the best you know structures of\nContracts and guarantees that are out there but also some just comprehensive and so what that means is we're not just looking at one piece we're looking at the whole puzzle together because your assets are going to help generate your income\nThat's also gonna affect what type of taxes you're paying and we want to pay as little in taxes as possible and you and that's why we call someone who hires us as their retirement plan or as we call there plenty custom built retirement plan because it is not cookie cutter in any way it's very different than every other Klimt we have\nAnd it's comprehensive so it's covering your income plans covering your taxes your investments we also want to make sure you're protected for health care\nAnd then we want you to have an estate planning to make sure that whatever's leftover after you're gone is going to pass to whomever you want with little taxes and delays as possible we want all those things to happen for you in one of the things that a lot of people find an enormous value is no that's all\nApt up in one relationship to get started we offer a new costs no obligation retire or view ... three nine retire to get started if you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement age three nine retire or
