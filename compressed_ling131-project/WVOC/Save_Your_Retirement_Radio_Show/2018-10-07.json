alone is mind boggling oh yeah oh God I wanted to mention a tip\nAs far as to find out a good shot wherever you are\nVery good piece of person that lives in the south is going to go to a church uh-huh\nAnd if you go to your local church a church or find a church in your community that you feel comfortable in a you could talk with any one of the members in church all the pastor himself you know I uh uh a pastor\nIs will the tower yeah I Know who the\nBest mechanic is who is the sheet rock or the best route for right but especially an automobile mechanic he will know and when you got to go to church every Sunday and you're in the presence of your mechanic he got the job\n[laughter] or else right and\nAnd that is true and and you know Ron another um another area that fits into that also\nIs a a hairdresser also here a restaurant I Know the good and bad do a lot of people that provide services that they get to they get to know a lot of other people they are they do that and I try to do that a lot for our customers customers that come in and\nUh the is not unusual at all to ask me if they know someone that does that paints houses or or does carpentry work in different things like that so you have\nTo literally and also well this is not a if you just want to find someone that by the phone book\nA what I Know what I've done in the past when I'm In a town that I'm and I don't know any body I'll get on the golf course I check with the local places and usually they all have a good suggestion which you could call up each one of those the gestures and ask them\nHow long have you been in business and his family run\nYeah you have this family run and they'd been in business for ... plus years is a safe bet that they'll do good war yeah great you know if he's been in business for a week\nAnd I know a set up a question for him telling me I have a periscope diesel and you need to know some smart plugs and see what they say [laughter]\nYou got that much investment in a vehicle when you look at a thirty\nTwenty thirty forty thousand dollar automobile mhm oh that was that the public sphere that close to but not far from my house he originally that was a silver cloud Rolls Royce in the parking lot Mm uh and just and I know just to show you how will this economy's doing\nI ended up last weekend I drove around Martin as an average to do a few errands I seen no less than five brand new spank him right out of the box or a vet\nBack out I mean everything on them and they I mean they would just beautiful or burned down that before\nWhat's what's funny about that too is like a nice cars and stuff like that he'd be just rarely see in the eighties model anything on the road anymore because of that same thing everybody's buying new or newer cars I'm it's just weird and I just don't see that era of cars there's still some Ninety hanging around but like eighties you just don't see that many of them\nKnow that and I'm asking you all spending a lot more time in a coffee room\n[laughter] for sure that\nGuy that I enjoy the show and this has been a well they're from Beijing you all have a great weekend maker said\nIran and we sure enjoy Ron calling for thank you very much okay the in that reminded me we have a Corvette down there now or Seventy eight Corbett gentleman had it forty years\nHe would like for us to put an engine in it ... you know both machine shop here in in this area I encourage everyone to have a machine shop that they're really no one trusts especially if you're a repair facility\nAnd you are even India person yeah yeah yeah I Do it yourself if you are if you do stuff for yourself\nIt's a good idea to have a really good machine shop in this in this area is one day you'll need some rotors could or a ... machine to do is kind of need to have something in your pocket and really that's what's great about here we have different areas that we\nWould you when you been in business a long time you get different companies that you trust a lot like for instance our printing needs here we use a company called Phoenix printing they're up in there well known in this area a huge well known and and we can throw a stone that I'm actually a a lot of things or even outside this area they do stuff all around the country\nUh but beautiful printing company would have been using those for years and so it when you go there in in you know what I'm Alone time oh you do is called them up and say hey I Want some more for number twenty two oh nine and things get easily exactly like what you're saying the same would work for an automotive shop when you\nHave a flat tire you say hey order ... tyrants in their system you know I Know the tire size or I Am coming from my old change they may know you have five vehicles or which one is it that kind of thing yeah\nYeah and and all of that just makes things go so much better when you when you were able to find good people to do the things you need now John run I think it's real important that we mentioned one of the main things\nThat has to do with finding a repair facility for you and that item has to do with crushed so absolute um bet that is the biggest things are when you're working with vehicles or you're working with another shop\nThere has to be some level of crush their\nUh because there's going to be things that that uh that shop may mention are made\nMentioned that needs to be done right that it is real difficult for you to know whether unless you listen to the seat and see her\nShow a lot it may be really difficult for you to know for sure whether that should need to be done for us as bright flushes right if they say bright flush and you don't know anything about bright floated you say a I've had cars\nTwenty years I've never replaced break Florida are you crazy right you have to have that level of trust the lighter model cars are a lot different than they used to be they have anti ... breaks I have a lot more power than they did they have\nBut also like kind of take it upon yourself to build trust in them when they tell you you need from break safe but I Want to see him yes and he told me what\nThat is a ask those questions so bad right point right there John John Ron ask those questions until you feel comfortable and that company that you're dealing with should feel very good about answering those questions\nAnd and I mean I think it's really quick to if you do that is really quick to decide if they're trustworthy or not simply because like I said if they say and he's great showman each breaks and if you feel it doesn't mean that kind of tells you the answer\nThat they should be willing to go above and beyond to make sure all of your questions are answered to where you feel really good\nAnd the only other thing is there's a little bit of legwork involved a lot of you are and one other way would be go get an inspection at a place that you're thinking about doing business with and we'll get another inspection at the other place you're thinking about doing business in well you know if they come back relatively close or the same and same price and stuff like that\nUm versus one might be recommending everything under the sun and one might you be\nSpecific on any breaks and this this and this protest a bliss and that\nDoes add wanted a final final items also\nThat adds in to wouldn't use as you're looking for shop\nGet something small for y'all go in and buy an engine yeah go ahead and have some old changes done and find out if at trust his air and then if you deal with uh make sure that they have all the acronym information go ahead and got ... with them and\nMake sure that they know your cell phone number if it's possible for you to give that let them know if you like to be text message if you like email or what type of information that you like so if you do all that there's no doubt in my mind you'll find you a good ... you will find a shop that that is right for you\nThe time clocks on eight would need to pull over now but we will be back on the road no Tom I'm Eric limits what co host Jon ... our show producers are dominant Frito Sandy client technical

those goals that we just talked about if you don't have a written retirement income plan call right now eight ... three nine retire absolutely no cost no obligation\nWe will set you up with a meeting that we call your retirement review which if you have a plan in place that will help you get where you want to be in retirement\nThat number's eight it was three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now at age do three nine seven three eight for seven through\nThe next two pillars that will need to build our dirty financial house for retirement has to do is growing and\nProtecting our assets find out what they are and how to incorporate them into your retirement blueprint that next stay with us [noise]\nSlowly inches upward soon it reaches the top stops for just a second then it propels you down faster and faster we have been experiencing a grapes climb in the stock market over the past few years when is it going to reach the top when will it had downhill what might happen to your investment when it does\nYou won't know unless you have a qualified financial advisors show you what could happen to your portfolio during and after a market correction now is the time to prepare before the market goes to the top and then does what markets do Russia's downhill called the preservation specialist\nAt eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five find out what you do now before a market correction let ... and the team at preservation specialists provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision eight zero three four five four nights\nYou know when you think about what happened when the market crashed in two thousand two thousand one and what happened in two thousand eight most people took a hit of some kind of there but now I Want you to also go back and think about how much do you have in your accounts in your investments now versus then and people that have been working hard accumulating will say well yeah there's more risk Claire\nSo even more so does that make it important that we do something to help you protect those assets you worked so hard for it\nLet's talk about some of the biggest risk we need to address pat was that the happier list\nWell this ties in a beautifully done with my book save your retirement which is designed to walk you through seven retirement villains and as I was kind of lifting these off I was thinking yeah well that's a villain that's all right\nSo the one we just talked about is market risk and that is you know when you think about a generation or two ago\nA lot of people could retire successfully and didn't have to worry about a four one K. or investments or anything like that now most people retiring do have to worry about those things in the years right before and right after you retire are critical to make sure you avoid significant market losses so that would be one\nAnother one with the longevity risk which is the first villain in my book because of the fact that we all love to live long healthy lives but the fact of the matter is that means we have to have more money and have it lasts longer so that's a risk certainly healthcare costs can pose a big risk and then the other one that comes to mind is inflation which is\nIf we retire at sixty or sixty five and if we live in or eighties or nineties that as a tremendous amount of time for things to get more and more expensive and more than likely you are on some type of fixed income or very close to a fixed income so we need to make sure we're protecting your assets\nAnd your dreams of the vision that you have that retirement from all of those risks\nThat's one thing it to identify the different risks how do we go about actually protecting our assets I'm guessing there's a number of different strategy because all of these risks are so different\nYes that's absolutely true there's different strategies for each one if we can go through those taking market risk and example it's one of the biggest reasons people come to the U.S and want to talk with us and help them figure out are they taking the right amount of risk you know have they made that balance successfully or they transitioning from an aggressive\nGrowth portfolio when they were younger to more of preserving and and creating income so really to protecting its market risk was really only two ways you can protect one would be to avoided altogether and the other would be diversification so what do I mean by avoid it well that means you've got all your money in your four one K.\nAnd you're scared with the market's going to do and you slide it all in the cash or something safe okay\nAnd we have people that have done that and maybe if you've accumulated enough and your concern about enough about the market and maybe that's okay for you for most people they need their money's still earning something because caches and earning anything so that's where diversification then comes in\nAnd that's the beauty of working with a comprehensive plan or is they can help you realize there's a lot more out there than what's in your four one K. C. four one K. is usually a limited to something in the stock market or something in the bond market and then something safe like cash\nAnd there's a whole host of other opportunities out there none of 'em are perfect right there is no perfect investment out there but there are all different kinds of things that have varying degrees of growth potential\nOf safety and then of access that you have and those are the three things we're always trying to balance so we can help you um determine what you have\nAn also look at all the things that are out there and help you figure out what the best way to defend against market risk is for you and then the second one gym that I mentioned is longevity risk which the bottom line there is as we talked about in the last segment you just have to have a written retirement income plan that's the bottom line you have to know where your income is going to come from\nIn part of that is figuring out which sources of income are going to last your whole life you know like Social Security has a federal\nGuarantee that's going to last our entire lives and while there are funding issues a significant issues with Social Security there is some type of guaranteed to that and thus far it has always been back to so that's an example of one of the options that are there and those are actually two perfect examples of\nWhat we talk about in our retirement reviews that we do with people that come to our office for the first time because there are all kinds of things that we deal with but two of the ones that are often\nOf critical concerns that people are\nHow am I going to generate income retirement and how do I make sure I'm Still earning money on my nest egg but I'm protecting myself from risk so those are two of the big areas we just talked about those are two things we cover in our new costs new obligation retirement review so that would be a value cause right now at age two or three nine retire\nIf you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now it was three nine retire mentioned that you heard the savior retirement radio show today to claim one of the remaining spots we have once again it's a two or three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nWe're talking with pat distribute today is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside in the studio had just gave me the phone number the website is retire with pat dot com and if you'd like to learn a little bit more\nWe've been talking about all of these risks that are looming in retirement pat what's another pillar a little bit more on the positive side rather than just the reds\nYes so uh obviously you know we want to talk about your assets we went to protect you from the risks of those for the next pillar we want to have is gross\nYou know we've already talked about generating income in retirement so we also of course want your money growing so I've yet to meet with someone in my Twenty one years of experience that would be satisfied having all their money a checking account\nAnd then just drawing down through retirement\nYou build up these assets and they should be working for you so\nThis is a great example gym that I like to talk about the three worlds of savings and investments because really one of them is purely for safety and the other two have varying degrees of gross you have kind of you're safe guaranteed world which might be bank accounts it might be us savings bonds that might be a new diesel guarantees\nAnd then you have the growth area which is usually things like the stock market mutual funds and things like that and then there's a middle world this kind of in between so that might be something that's not tied to the market but it's designed to generate some type of income or growth combination\nSo there are three things left that would have some type of guarantee number one will be Social Security which again we mentioned briefly habits funding problems but it is still guaranteed by our federal government\nWhich is not a failed to pay that out up to date a number two would be some type of pension plan if you worked for a company or a government entity that pays out and the number three would be any type of duty contract\nThat would have some type of income guaranteed to it so those are the three places that you can create guaranteed retirement income now does every dollar of your retirement income need to be guaranteed know what a lot of people like to do is maybe have\nTheir God of habits their absolute minimum paid by those things that can provide a lot of security\nAnd that's one approach to retirement income planning and that really depends on your personality and comfort level with those types of things I'm not everyone can do that and so that's where the beauty of the independent planning with your own retirement plan or who's going to customize a plan for you can be so valuable\nPat how much income should we need in retirement compared to before retirement ... how do income needs tend to change once we leave their regularity of our working years\nJim this is one of those I really believe there are general rules I'm sure you know you know Seventy to eighty percent of ...\nOr pre retirement income is often thrown around as an income replacement number\nAnd we certainly have clients that fit right into that range but I Will tell you I have clients that you know we're talking about it and they'll say I can't imagine getting anything less than what I'm I'm living off of right now as an example I also have clients who let's say their goal was they're paying off their mortgage rate when they retire\nSo now you think of all the things are going the way they don't have the commuting costs they don't have their mortgage payments they are maybe plowing a lot of money into their retirement plan so they're not gonna be doing that anymore retirement and so they're looking at say I don't need nearly that much\nSo that's where you and I joke sometimes I don't like to call the budget but he's really just about having a general spending plan for retirement and there are two types of people in the world that I found there are people that love spreadsheets and already have that figure it out right and they say okay I'm going to spend you know Fifteen dollars and twelve cents on fast food this week\nAnd then there are people that you know the hear the word budget in their eyes kind of ... and they panic [laughter] so\nSo your spending plan can be tailored in you know how specific it as it can be tailored to your interests as long as you know we're not in a kind of dangerous situation of you know you having to really skimpy in retirement\nHopefully our goal is for our clients in retirement can really kind of live their passion and do exciting things and fund things\nBut that's where it really can be incredibly valuable to have that retirement plan or working with you\nHelping you think about what that vision in what those goals are for retirement not necessarily to the penny but helping you figure that out and then of determining where that incomes going to come from and that's all about what we do in that retirement review that we love to talk about now this is not some generic cookie cutter report it is customize specifically just for you\nAll you need to do is call right now at eight o three nine retire\nWe certainly keep a very full calendar but we set aside opening specifically for listeners ups they show so call now and a two or three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now to reserve one of the remaining spots at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nPets truly is the founder of preservation specialist I'm generally jak alongside in Studio ... what's the next Taylor if we are trying to build our financial blueprints for retirement what else should be included\nWhat'd you and I think we kind of teased on this one already which is you know the last one we talked about as having income in retirement this next one is than protection for your retirement income some protection that if the economy is bad if the stock market's bad in your nest egg gets depleted what type of protection do you have a you still have money coming in every month\nAnd so where does that protection come from though we have talked about three different areas that can come from that and one would be Social Security so what's going to guarantee that well it's the full faith and credit of the federal government\nNow my opinion is that the taxes that have been paid for Social Security have not been handled properly but that's neither here nor there we can't deal with that the good news is if you are depending on Social Security that our federal government has the power to tax and the power to print money\nSo those are both on your side uh as far as the guarantee for Social Security next would be a pension now what's guaranteeing your pension that's a really big question and you know early in my career Jen you know if you had a company pension everyone kind of just assumed it was going to be fine\nWell wow has that changed in the last two decades yeah I'm the vast majority of people that we meet with if they have a lump sum option for their pension they're almost always going to take it\nAnd the simple reason for that is companies are desperately trying to get out of those pension obligations and there are all kinds of strategies that can use to do so so he company pension or we would believe would be very different it's guarantees\nThat a government pension and of course we want to know the government pension what type of funding it has there are states like Illinois and California I Would be very nervous about the same fate of Carolina's numbers are better than that\nBut we talked to a gym a moment ago about that idea of you know in a perfect world you know the things that have these guarantees we'd love to have them covering your necessities on a monthly basis and for some people may be Social Security and pensions might cover that but certainly not all people as you know\n... what are some of the options if you do have some sort of gap or shortfall why some options for filling that are bridging that gap\nWell they're limited Gen because when we are trying to figure out your retirement income we talked about eight different sources but we talked with only three that have some type of guarantees to them so we've already covered Social Security and pensions\nIf you have a gap there generally speaking the only viable option that has a guaranteed backing it is going to be some type of ingenuity that offers some type of guaranteed lifetime income in fact we've seen people and companies even called a personal pension\nSo let's say for example and we've had this happen with a number of clients who really like that idea of having some type of guaranteed to cover their absolute basic necessities in any given month and let's see as an example and say their Social Security and their pension covers most of their expenses but let's say there's a thousand dollar gap there\nSo they are going to have most of their expenses their basic expenses covered\nThere's a thousand dollars a month still need to cover that well we can do is we can shop these guaranteed lifetime income annuity companies and say\nWho will pay the client a thousand dollars a month guaranteed for life\nAnd what what you have to deposit into this annuity to get that guarantees so we can chop it and find out essentially what we're doing is we're saying with the least amount of money for my mistake I have to use\nTo generate that thousand dollars a month and of course it doesn't have to be a thousand dollars a month it's just a simple example and the beauty of that Jen is when we're looking at all the different savings and investment vehicles out there when you have an independent plan or like we are\nWhose license to deal with anything we can shop anything and and figure that out so if we get a number back from the new the company\nAnd you look at it and we look and we say that's really good that seems like a great fit for you and it's only using a portion of your nest egg than we can run with that if we get that number back and we don't like that number that maybe that's not the right fit for you or maybe it's not the right time for you to do something like that maybe you're younger and mapped just doesn't work in your favor so there's a lot of variables there\nWe think there's an enormous value to having not only someone who is independent who can help shop for you and find the best you know structures of\nContracts and guarantees that are out there but also some of this comprehensive and so what that means is we're not just looking at one piece we're looking at the whole puzzle together because your assets are going to help generate your income\nThat's also gonna affect what type of taxes you're paying and we want to pay as little in taxes as possible and and that's why we call someone who hires us as their retirement plan or as we call there are plenty custom built retirement plan because it is not cookie cutter in any way it's very different than every other Klimt we have\nAnd it's comprehensive so it's covering your income plans covering your taxes your investments we also want to make sure you're protected for health care\nAnd then we want you to have an estate plan and make sure that whatever's leftover after you're gone it's going to pass to whomever you want with his little taxes and delays as possible\nWe want all those things to happen for you and one of the things that a lot of people find an enormous value there's no that's all wrapped up in one relationship to get started we offer a new costs no obligation retirement review call out into three nine retire to get started\nIf you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement age three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nWe're talking with
