the uh for him right here yeah Senate the Senate doctor on it's a huge book\nFor quick reference this is the south Carolina legislative manual twenty Eighteen\nThat's huge book anyway with that being said the reason we're referencing bet moment is because there was a story this week in the state newspaper should South Carolina Raj be named after lawmakers who have pled guilty to corruption\nThe simple answer is of course no so why are we even bringing this up and then you mentioned John course in immediately asked that his name be removed after he pled guilty and he points out that are in the story that it was because of his upbringing in because of the training he received as a marine\nThat you realize you gotta take responsibility for your mistakes listen I'm pleading guilty to this I made a mistake I Can't be\nHonored afterwards theory you got to take my name off that thing so who who wants their name still up there are plenty guilty well of course\nThe only state senator who many other senators would say if anybody needs a road named after him it's this guy many guys many people say that or he wants a article many people are they that I think he said that I think he said that anybody would say that I should have been roads named after me he did say that that many people would say that about him ...\nOn this planet deserves a road named after him it's Robert Ford so says\nRobert ... referring to himself as a third for these like Iraq he a great one says anyway he believes that he worked harder than anybody\nTo get a bridge and the little country and because of that the name of the bridge needs to be the Robert Ford bridge now and forever\nNow the other people that he quotes who aren't available by name a also will point out that Robert Ford is the only one who calls it the road to immortality\nNonetheless yeah I'm I'm trying to find the actual he has that in a written lifting up his accomplishments as a senator he calls it the road to immortality\nI if I understand that writer Jonathan the list is the road to immortality these are the things that I've accomplished my mind when I tell you something about the actual road no no no no no good name Robert Ford will be revered of what Dan for many lifetimes to come\nTo them and I wanted to actually start petition that we have the as the DOT\nCall it a little road mortality [laughter] well as we mentioned earlier four hundred plus bridges are crumbling here and they need to be replaced maybe that would\nBe they just stop it halfway through so you just drive off into mortality is your land somewhere in a pond or you have arrived at the last site she [laughter]\nYeah you would have arrived at it\nSo he says you can't take a name off of that bridge you can't do it I'm too important oh my gosh I work too hard and I deserve it out did he plead guilty absolutely yes yes I yes I broke the law many times you hear\nThe issue is I Need to be honored from henceforth why why do we\nEven care what Robert Ford's opinion on Robert Ford is at this point not everybody's going to be as forthright as John course it was and saying look you got to take my name off into saying I Know I\nI don't know when it's fired a pretty Wilkes in the state newspaper to write this article\nBut I think it's because Robert Ford is petitioning his former ah you know in a co workers they're up at the state house you better I think my name off of it oh I see okay yeah I guess you know if anything should be named Robert Ford's honor it would be like the naughty kitty or whatever that Bush was exit [laughter]\nBut Robert Ford exit\nTwo pleasure [laughter]\nFor those of you who are new to Colombia or don't remember the story was like twenty twelve twenty thirty something a long time ago a Robert Ford was being investigated because he was using his a\nCampaign funds to buy all this very personal but here's the lion's den and the angry kidding it was a kid he I think it was a naughty kitty whether there was like on the angry kitty [laughter] some ... bought stuff that his violate a little whip got so\nAngry [noise] ... ah [laughter]\nOh my gosh now he does back it up just using the historical reference as to the Confederate monuments saying at the time those men believed that they were doing what they thought best for South\nCarolina so in South Carolina was to buy some stuff at the anger catty and other sort of thing that was in South Carolina is it true I Know\nI don't know and I also like you said but ah what is it I never protested when they were naming those buildings and statues after these gentlemen or are you hearing like\nNo he's saying I didn't like call for them to be brought down well he said I never protested they weigh a me like Tillman hall at five as\nI listen to him at all good name with that if that's what y'all want asked what he said I'll just give me my bridge name and I'll be hit the anger kitty well I remember Robert Ford why he was also very upset when Sherman burned down the original lie in the U.S [laughter]\nIt's a hot stove or not those original lotions were very first game coverage is after dinner for thirty ... to John Joey checker

[laughter]\nI Love the ... too so yeah for the next one we're just going to love a bunch of things together and anything that would be considered a retirement account yeah the first things that would probably obviously come to mind would be a four O. one K.\nOr tradition or off IRA if you work for a nonprofit to be a four three be typically\nI'm going to throw pensions in there as well as with anything that is a retirement plan essentially that either you control or that an employer controls\nAnd these are like you said probably where you thought we were going to start and of course these are hugely valuable and the pension in the retirement accounts of course are very different so pensions\nAre incredibly valuable right now because they have that opportunity to provide you income that you can count on at least hopefully depending on what type of pension that you have\nAnd they're of course disappearing so we're not seeing those as much\nSo most people end up with that traditional i._r._a. and that four one K. and that's a huge asset to have but now all of a sudden the responsibility is shifting tremendously and a generation ago that responsibility for retirement income was on the employer or the government who was offering the pension\nThat has now been shifted heavily on to our listeners shoulders because now if you're retiring with a four O. one K.\nYou've got to figure out what the heck to do with that and how to turn it into income so that's where it's very valuable to be kind of giving this some thought and thinking about okay how do I go from actually getting a paycheck to now having this asset which is a wonderful thing but I Need to generate\nAnd if you're working with a plan or a a retirement plan or like us\nUh well we can do is we can try to help you evaluate if an annuity would be of benefit at all and if so what type might make sense and then we can kinda essentially shop the marketplace and try and find something that's a ... so the way they would have worked in as rather than being built into the four one K.\nThere'd be some planning as to at some point either near retirement or at retirement rolling some of that four one K. out into an IRA so there's no taxation to you and then using that higher rate or a portion of that IRA to fund is a new id\nUltimately that sounds like a lot of steps but ultimately what we're trying to do is just to turn an asset which is a pile of money and your four one K. into a different type of ... which is a guaranteed income stream and that's one of those things it's just different and\nA lot of people if you're approaching retirement it's probably not a discussion or an experience you've ever had and that's of course All right but you know we don't expect you to be experts in this what we want to do is we want to be there as a resource for you to help guide you\nAnd maybe through that process we determined that that's not fit for you I mean if there's pros and cons to every type of planning area\nWe wouldn't help you figure out what fits for you for some people it can be a huge benefit to help build up that kind of guaranteed income that you're planning for\nA on a monthly basis in in what we find is ultimately our job with you is to build out a written retirement income plan and you might say well what is the point of that well the point is you've got something you can look at and you can actually see where your incomes going to come from for the rest of your life what the plan is to do that\nAnd the goal there is really to just give you a tremendous amount of peace of mind you can see okay\nNow I'm going away for a paycheck\nAnd now I see where I'm actually going to be able to live and can do to do things and I don't have to sit there and worry about what his money disappearing or where's that going we found you end up so many people will just found an enormous relief from that type of process and that's why we offer our first meeting an absolutely no cost and no obligation we call it a retirement review\nAnd we offered an opportunity to sit down with one of our independent advisors to help you uh look at your situation make sure you're right on track and help you see if it makes sense to start building we call it custom built retirement plan which means it's designed specifically for you the first step is to call us right now at eight o three nine retire\nWe've blocked off time in the next two weeks specifically for listeners of today's show but the space is limited so call now it it was three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside in the studio patch it gave me the phone number\nWebsite is retire with pat dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we're talking about important assets most valuable asset for retirement and we've made this point before but again Patt\nSome of them are tangible some of them are really relating to dollars and cents things we might typically think God's when we think about our most valuable assets\nOthers are intangible and I want to spend a few minutes on some of those before we get to this next break tell me what are some of the valuable assets that aren't necessarily something we can pick up or look at it on a statement\nYeah this is one agenda that is so incredibly valuable and some of it's in our control in some is up and that's your good health so depending on what kind of what stage here at in life\nYou know you may feel like you're in great health right now you may be struggling with the health issues but this is something that's so important and it's one of those things ... you know I'm forty four right now\nI can feel and maybe I'm much more empathy for someone whose retirement age now that I did last thirty four years of and so you start understanding the aches and pains and all those kinds of things but what's really happened in Twenty one years of experience for me is\nI realize how precious every day is and you just don't know what the future holds and that comes through in our planning because what we really want to do is we want to find out what do you really want to do you mentioned this in the very beginning of the show\nDo you want to travel the world do you want to spend time with family with grandkids [laughter] um do you want to volunteer at your church what do you really want to be doing because we don't have any idea how long any of us are going to be here and we can't blow all your money in the first few years the retirement may you may live a long time\nBut at the same time the last thing I Want to do Jen and I feel like a lot of people that plans for retirement and the financial world they just want you to sit on a pile of money and I just hate that thought of thinking that you missed out like you said you never get time back\nSo while you're younger and healthier and retirement let's find a way to help you enjoy and do the things that you want to do so one of the ideas it may sound kind of silly but we talk about if you do have a longer retirement there's gonna be three stages\nStage one does that go go year siege two as this logo in stage three is the no go and so we want your go go years to really be filled with all the things that are important to you\nAnd then we all understand that that's not going to last forever so we're probably going to slow down at some point and then we have a no go which means if we're still living and we're in our nineties you're probably not going to be jet setting to Europe or something like that right [laughter] so and we really just want to think about all these things and really help you accomplish the things that you've always wanted to accomplish and have the retirement of your dreams\nAnd the other thing to point out pat when we talk about your health and time\nReally what good is all of your wealth that you the ... is you no longer have the or health or as you said if you are too afraid to enjoy it I mean that really defeats the purpose of what you've been doing for so long right\nThat's exactly right Jan and one of the most rewarding things that we've learned how to do is when we're building those written retirement income plans we can build that lifestyle into it and what you mean by that is when I was raised my parents have always been very frugal you know there are parents lived through the depression\nAnd so they've got that kind of mentality\nAnd it's good in a way that you're responsible and you know don't rack up debt and things like that but you also can miss out right and I will tease my mom all the time and say mom you don't have to feel guilty about doing something you know so they lean to that direction and so finding that balance to help you create a plan\nThat actually maybe puts a budget in there for whatever those things are maybe for you you have grandkids that are spread out around the country and you want to go visit them so you've got to travel budget in there for those trips just whatever that thing is we want to make sure we budget and we put it in there and then takes the guilt away and it gives you that peace of mind\nTo know that it's all part of your planning because he's a comfort to know you're not blowing through everything and being reckless\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialist same general ... alongside in Studio ... again I go back to the big unknown\nWould be how long you will live than because we don't know how long we need our assets to last we have to figure out how to\nPreserve them what about things like insurance had is that something that is part of this list of most valuable asset for retirement\nIs Jen and this is one of those topics that you know we have a lot of different philosophies out there and you are someone who is worried about risk you might be heavy on insurance you might want to buy the most comprehensive insurance on everything meanwhile there are people who believe that insurance is a rip off and you want to pay as little as possible right\nWell there are some truth to each side and finding that balance for you is what really matters you know we talked about health insurance earlier\nMaybe your personality has to have a very low deductible or maybe a high deductible is appropriate for you so it's not a one size fits all but you want to have some type of insurance against major medical do you need life insurance so it's a question we get a lot most people build up their life insurance if you're married with small children at the time that you might buy a lot of it\nAnd maybe you still have it and you're thinking why am I paying for this\nAnd it's a great question to ask because maybe those funds can be better used saving for it", "year":
