things together and then just objectively trying to figure out what's the best way to do that so we call that comprehensive retirement planning\nAnd that's why when someone hires us we call it a custom built retirement plan\nSo it's about looking at everything together\nHelping you figure out if you're on track to accomplish our goals\nTo get started we offer an no costs new obligation retirement review you can get started by calling ... three nine retire if you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement\nJust call us right now a new three nine retire call right now to reserve one of the spots we have specifically for listeners of today's show so call us right now at age ... three nine retire\nWe're talking today with pets through the he's the founder of preservation specialist that number again is eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three talking today about financial advice is a financial advice you've been getting for the transition to retirement on target\nWill talk about some more things you need to think about the answer that question coming up next on retirement lift serving\nIt's slowly inches upward soon it reaches the top stops for just a second then it propels you down faster and faster\nWe have been experiencing a grapes climb in the stock market over the past few years when is it going to reach the top when will it had downhill\nWhat might happen to your investment when it does you won't know unless you have a qualified financial advisors show you what could happen to your portfolio during and after a market correction now is the time to prepare before the market goes to the top and pen does what markets do Russia's downhill called the preservation specialist\nAt eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five find out what you do now before a market correction let ... and the team at preservation specialist provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision\nEight zero three four five four Ninety forty five that's eight zero three four five four Ninety forty five ... and it's not like wind investment advisor service is off the coast capital make\nWe thanks for joining us\nToday they save your retirement with pat ... generally jak here alongside ... he's the founder of preservation specialists you've seen pat and the local media you read his articles in USA Today and investors business daily\nHe joined me today as we talk about whether you're getting good advice for going through this checklist to help you determine if you are getting a good financial guidance this is so important as you head into retirement one of the things you want to know is is the advice he gave her you're working with is required to put\nYour best interests ahead of their own self patch should we ask more from our financial professional van upholding the fiduciary standard\nYes ah in fact I heard a speaker say many many moons ago Gen if someone is giving you bad advice there's only two possible answers it's because they don't know the right answer it where they don't care if he would always say well which one is better and the point being neither one is acceptable right [laughter]\nSo you need someone who cares which is the fiduciary standard because they're putting your interests first but then you also need somebody who knows my second item on the checklist is you need to determine if the financial professional who's providing you with a device\nHas the skill set in the know how to help guide you financially in the current phase of life you're in right now\nAnd if you're not retired yet into retirement and this is a topic that I Know we've discussed a little bit in the past I Would say early in my career Jen I I really wouldn't have realized how powerful and how important this was but this is something that I have conversations with clients about on a daily basis and it's not me bringing it up its people kind of saying\nThis is what's on their mind and the analogy I always use is\nThe overly simplistic one in our industry says there's two phases of your financial life there's accumulating while you're working and then there's\nTaking income in preserving when you're retired and I always say you know think of that accumulation phase just ... you know do you think of like a horse a racehorse or they put blinders on them that's the best thing to think of\nIf you're listening to this and you're far from retirement you're just trying to figure out how to put money or four one K. or whatever just set it up with your employer put blinders on and then just don't even pay attention to just work and say work and say that's the key but it's you can't do that until the day you retire like that doesn't work so there needs to be a third phase and that's the transition phase\nAnd this is what we're talking about is do you have someone to help guide you through and this is where I get lots and lots of questions everyday jet which is when do I started that transition is it based on how old I Am how far from retirement how much I've saving accumulated\nA of course it's a mix of all those things and so this is that transition time that we think is incredibly powerful to help you make sure you're getting good advice to lead you into that retirement stage\nWell pat why skills inexperience should we look for in the person who's going to help us with this transition phase for retirement\nI think there's a number of them that come to mind for me Gen ... what kind of walk through a few of those here uh one would be\nMost people when we're thinking of retirement planning the first thing that comes to their mind as their nest egg of their investments\nMost people don't have the benefit of being able to just retire up say Social Security or social screen of pensions so they're living off of a four one K. or some type of nesting so that's where the again if you're a twenty five and putting your first dollar and you're four one K.\nHey that money's going to be sitting there hopefully for a long time when you're trying to get close to retirement you got a lot more eggs in those baskets that you need to protect\nSo you need more of a balance and so it's figuring out how do you balance that and the example I always uses a loss on your nest egg at sixty five is far far far more damaging that thirty five\nOne thing most will pick up on right away as well sure I don't have as much time to make it up but the other point I always make is you've got a lot more at risk right you might have saved two hundred fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million or more when you're about ready to retire as opposed to early in your life when there's usually a lot of the roads [laughter] on the account so that's the first one of the next one is given\nJohn Law Eighteen thirty five survey street [noise]\nNow here's Christopher Johnson [noise]\nWe had another storm moved through the Palmetto State a couple of days ago but the dark cloud surrounding the game ... football program actually cleared last Saturday afternoon that's when Carolina fought Missouri and\nMother Nature winding up wet but victorious and with renewed faith in the future ... keep that momentum going today against an FCC opponent they've never beaten\nWe'll find out soon the game tax facing off against twenty second ranked Texas A M attempt test coming up at three thirty on the SEC Network and our count down to kick off his on his we join you once again from the circle and BP station right across bluff wrote from Williams rice and\nRight across from the fairgrounds where the state fair is in full swing we broadcast is always from our debt from architect of Columbia inviting you to stay with us oh it acts three hours for our best game got coverage here on a news radio five sixty WBRC\nComing up ... got quarterbacks detainee he'll drop by our tailgate party he'll give us this scouting report on today's match up with the Aggies and what it means to have\nTo proven to be on the Carolina sideline will check out the\nFull schedule of an cc game the league landing and ate a season I ate teams in this week's town twenty five two of those teams already playing this afternoon\nWe'll also hear from will ... players and gain got beat writer Josh Kendall from the state newspaper will join us with the latest news on this Carolina program that in a whole lot more all coming up on our best game got coverage as we take you right up to kick off on the SEC Network well let's find out what Carolina fans are talking about today and they were much more optimistic\nCrowd these last seven days after\nThat when last week we bring you gain got storyline shrimp spurs and feathers joining us now the editor spurs and feathers Jeff Owens in jeopardy certainly a lot more positive talk this week coming off that Missouri when which was probably as wild at day as you'll ever see in Williamsburg\nRight yes certainly one of the wild is football games I've ever saying with the weather uh I don't think I've ever seen it rained that hard as it did during the third quarter and and then the light and in the ways and the drama at the end it was just a fantastic football game and uh you have to give the game talks a lot of credit for hanging in there\nI'm making plays it the right time and and the ... was outstanding particularly on that last drive in the game talks were able to wind up with a last second feel go and um that certainly gave them a gives them a lot of confidence and hopefully a lot of momentum going into the day\nYeah I think people forget where this program was seven days ago I mean there was at seven days prior to that because there was depression there was a low as me I mean you had gained ... wondering if there was another victory other than Chattanooga on the schedule this season and then certainly last week when it gets Missouri was a big\nPickup yeah it was it ... it was huge and you know particularly the way they did it uh because they didn't really protect with oil that well but uh they did the things that they needed to do\nTo win a ... you know in the defense is a perfect example you know they gave up nearly five hundred yards of total off ants but they kept him out of the end zone they held in the five field goals and they came up with huge place in the red zone or that kept him out of the end zone and\nIt turned out to be you know the factor the the winning factor in the game and then you know you had scored ... step up and that certainly gave fans are a lot of excitement and I feel you know nice good the one\nUh this week and uh so they needed that you know coming off of that Kentucky Lawson is down as everybody was they not only needed to win but I think they needed to win it that way you know they needed some drama subject excitement\nAnd uh let's hope that carries over to this week\nJesse Owens is with us the editor of spurs and feathers and Jeff you touched on scar Nikki is winning ways last week but we'll mice champ immediately says coming into this week okay a healthy Jake Bentley is the game ... starter what do you think about that decision\nI think it's the right move a you know shake his head as his rough spots no question about it didn't play with that well in Kentucky but you think back to the ... at the way he is white over the last couple of years he's Fifteen in mind as a starter\nOr he essentially saved your season in twenty sixteen when he became the starting quarterback and they went from a what looked like a pretty bad season to win and you know\nFor the last seven games he let them doing on and four season last year\nUh probably did not meet expectations as we expected it from from him as a quarterback but he played pretty darn well and uh got off to a little rough start this year have been a little bit inconsistent but he's the guy that got you to this point\nHe knows the ... better than anybody and he still has tremendous talent it can get the job that I think he made the right decision that we'll see how jak response that today a particularly with me you know a ... I Hope we can go out there and have a good game and the\n... and put all this behind him but uh we'll see it's going to be a tough challenge\nThat yeah I was going to say today may be as tough attest to spindly could experience especially at a Bentley who's at the very least hampered by a knee brace and may not be as mobile as he was you can certainly not afford to be one dimensional against the ...\nYeah and I think that's the thing that worries me the most uh today you know I think Jay can have some success throwing the ball or the the one area on Texas a m's defense that's a little bit weak is their past events there one of the worst past the ... teams\nIn the SEC so I think he can have success\nThrowing the football today and I think they're going to have to do that 'cause it's going to be tough running the ball but the thing that worries me is Texas a and M. has a right past Russian and knowing that we probably aren't going to be able to run the ball they're probably\nGoing to bring the house a lot of times and Jake's going to have to be mobile and he's going to have to move around they're probably going to flush them out of the pocket so the question is can he handled that with his knee and and the lack of mobility he's had with that the injury so I think that's a big big question today and a big story in or if it looks like he's struggling\nOr having to run a lot and uh and not moving particularly well we could see a Michael's or Nicki again\nI think you're absolutely right there Jeff Owens has with is the editor of spurs and feathers Jeff one thing no one of those ... and well much damn seemed to have one every week but one of the motto is going to last week's game it gets Missouri was doing the simple things better you mentioned they didn't play at their best but did you see that from the gang\n... I think they cleaned up a lot of things in the secondary a there are a lot of things they still did not do well they still did not run the ball as well as they did they they didn't tackle particularly well uh Missouri had almost three hundred yards a\nYou know rushing in a lot of that was mixed tackles it tackles and given up big poison all that stuff but I thought the secondary took a big step forward last week a they face one of the best quarterback in the country Andrew Lock it and we expected him to come in here and throw all over that defense\nThe way the secondary hip poised so far but that didn't happen they held him to two hundred yards passing\nAnd they kept him out of the end zone they really tightened things up when they got down in the red zone and I think that was the difference in the ball game is forcing them to kick five we'll go instead of allowing them to score touchdowns and um they were two or three occasions where they broke all big wall runs it got into the red zone and the defense turned back so I think um\nI think they cleaned up a lot of things with their communication and the boy that secondary so I think that was the big story that came out of that that a game they still got some things to clean up up front with tackling ... and they often say one thing\nAnd then of course the challenge today for the defenses stop potential seen him team that just loves to eat\nClock yeah they do that they lead a the SCC and I think their second in the nation and Tama possession they also run the ball really well they got the best but leading Russia and the SEC they also got a quarterback\nA dual threat quarterback who kept running them throw it so there's going to be a tremendous amount of pressure on the defense today and and they're gonna have to\nUp and play the best game where there's the season for them to have a chance to win\nIs just going to the editor of spurs and feathers Jeff\nWe mentioned last week again pack seemed to have so many of these must win games on their schedule early it was Georgia was a must win game to compete for the SEC East that everyone said got to beat Kentucky because of that losing streak that everyone said gotta be Missouri to see if there's any season left for Carolina so as you look at today's game\nIs today one of those must win game average Carolyn absolutely this this is you know we've had with the open date coming ...\nAbsolutely that this was a very pivotal game you lose this gang your three and three\nAnd a and you look down the road and you see tough gangs that Florida and all this and Clemson and all of a sudden you know the hope an ops optimism doesn't look that great you wind today and your foreign to and you got a lot more confidence a lot of momentum and then you you feel like you could beat Tennessee at home and you feel like you could go on the road and possibly\nBe Florida and all this but this was a pivotal game\nAnd and I think it's a state that game for this team because we really don't know what kind of team we got yet I mean they've set been such a inconsistent Jekyll and Hyde team so far we they point to great games they play too awful games\nAnd they pulled one out last week that was about as wild as it could be so you really don't know the identity of this team in a one week they run the ball well one way to pick the one we played quake the defense the next week they do\nToday is a statement game I think they if they can come out and win this game that I think will start to figure out what team what kind of team we got ... and I do think this is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Save Your Retirement Radio Show", "city": "Columbia", "day": "13"}
