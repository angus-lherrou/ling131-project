U. S. like bus\nNo where they are saying look for that real close because you're going to have something no doubt I mean the PC um could be faulty of course however there's items on that jeep that can pool the bus line down which there's a communication line on that vehicle so that all the models talk to each other including the strip and all\nThe security logic could actually stored in two different places of course like you said the key recognizes the key the computer says okay it's a good key let's crank up and run\nHowever if you have a security problem of course it limits the running of the engine and it does that by shutting our power to like the ... the relay which makes sense because of course obviously that's why you don't have communication because the PC um is technically asleep I'm so\nIf I show let let me let me ask you if I I'm just skim module ... was was let's say the ... was bad right um what I still be able to communicate to the TV a PC and\nYou should be able to communicate to the ... uh with the skin you might as well being bad now if it was shorted for some reason and it was pulling the bus line down that the possibility of you know why you couldn't connect to it um but again it's it sees an invalid kid\nShuts power off to you know several different things like like you said of course it kills the injector so that's why it shut you know runs for a second chance off\nBut if there's an issue with ... pulling the bus line down really I think what you would benefit from this one is some diagnostics in the way of pinch checking the PC and uh you know it has several different sources for power is going to the computers and naturally as several sources for ground\n'em and you know you want to make sure you have a full twelve twelve and a half old there and of course you want to make sure you have no voltage dropped on grounds\nUm before he kind of condemned the P. C. M. another thing that uh you can do I don't know what kind of scheme Tories and\nWell it is it's funny you guys are talking about pets so uh so I Am using a a just a a cheap plug in blue cheese ah\nI'm told readers and using the port\nReport or I Am familiar with that when you\nAre no doubt I mean that's a great tool for like you said and as far as using the scan the computer and stuff like that\nOr just personally I don't know that I Would trust it to diagnose especially at ... pm a issue mainly because they do you know they don't have the same software they don't have the same uh need communication that say like a factory tool has\nThe reason I mentioned that is because even if that can line was down even if there was no communication in the car whatsoever the factory why tech for that vehicle who used to be star mobile but uh you can actually do a bus check and it actually goes out and basically they call it being modules that sends a signal to the module\nIt looks for a response to sends a signal to the next one and it'll tell you what it's all on line\nAnd for instance if it had a skin module in it tried to ... and of course it came back you know with no response than a technician will go there are ... went to the P. C. M. and had no response you go there and of course you do the same pinch checking it whichever monitor wasn't on line [noise]\nUm because the ... are really bad on those a jeep wrangler also for the same issue they have a printed circuit board on the back in uh I Know that sounds crazy it's it's still worth a shot because you can do this\nThey'd be lightly tap above the dash a there was an issue with those to where they would lose the security feed going into the cluster and it would lock the PC 'em out so I Know it sounds crazy but if you lightly tap on the dash to see if you can get any kind of gauge as to come back up\nA air and sister had the bomb was same problem I don't know if you remember her black ring to it it was very similar to that now her security light didn't come on but of course it was set in security codes you know skim not not valid basically\nRight and so I don't necessarily just put a PC a minute because even even if he\nWent in an avenue as far as rebuilding is still a good chunk of change that same amount of money could be you know of course used for diagnostics to be absolutely sure it either needs that are uh could be something very you know even um you know even a a as the relay if it's not sending power to the PC um of course the same thing\nOr if you wanted to try that just swap it with the horn relate it's the same ... um I mean I\nI I have lived ... around and I am I'm you know some positions censored and stuff like that I don't want to play darts\n... computers and then if for some reason though you did decide you you say where you wait everything out and you would really\nWant to go ahead and do the PC um I Would do a couple of things I Would try and now apple and even other parts places\nOr to get estimates own water rebuilt a PC um would be that way when you got one you would have it already uh you would have immediately and you would have a completely different PC um\nWell keep in mind you still have to buy the Vin number in it and learn the key right and you would still have to do some program and once you do that now if you did decide to send it off I don't have that number in front of me I look around everywhere I thought I had it up here in Studio\nBut I don't ... if you are if you were to give me a call and I will um ... and I will look for that and I will find that number but I Do have a few numbers where if I have a a PC um or an AC um that I really need to have rebuilt for some weird reason\nThan I Do have a place that I send them off to and there are several reputable ones own line do you do ... or could\nYou know sir I've I've looked at a at a bunch of them you know the prices just range so much from the from the ...\nYeah and and of course no doubt do what you do what do the same as if you were looking for an automotive repair facility you want to look at their reviews you want to look at their website as if it looks like it you might want to give them a call and if you communicate well and sip it sounds like a good organized company and then if if it does\nThen you would feel comfortable sending your PC 'em to them and and having them rebuild if you don't have that comfortable feel and then you might not but I Do a lot more try what John Ryan Mitch you go to and have that diagnostic front now a lot of things would that to happen it sounds like you have some expertise on doing what you're doing\nA lot of times you could do very well let's say on certain circuits and\nOxygen serve mass Airflow sisters things like that but when you get down to the computer those are a lot of money and sometimes you're worth a try and get not even you might even call it a second opinion on making sure that that's what's wrong\nOkay\nAll right well I appreciate it thanks thanks yes\nWell we thank you very much we sure do appreciate the phone call hopefully that was helpful gotta goes uh it open for doing either one would work out well okay at a time clock is only will we need to pull over now but we'd be back on the road no time\nAnd I'm ever in Columbus without co host Jon ... money in our show producers or Dominic Frito and we have some sad news Dominic\nHas taken a position with a major network and then today will be his last day and we have love working with Dominic he does a great job and they may be filling in from time to time uh with that but Joe it rich will be our new producer and he and he gave us a tip\nA little while ago about the ways that he uses out as an app and he will be working with us on a regular basis and our senior producer is saying decline our technical engineers that low Alan and we would all I say thank you all use it tuned in logged in and especially those that called\nIn to rod with us with a CNC auto show [noise]\nPlenty of time hunger and millions more lenient isolation drop on a hot meal and allow volunteer for meals on wheels donating their minds prank at America like ... or ...\nMost of my family they never graduated high school so I'm trying to break that barrier my daughter Brooklyn was also motivation for me to go back to school every day after work went straight to school and it paid off\nAt age twenty four ... ... I could not have\nDone it alone I see the future is really no\nOne can take 'em alone you were thinking of your high school diploma you have now signed free on education grounding in God or brand name like a Dollar General later you reduce the outcome I have\nThat one of the most important ingredient\nTo a quality car repair whether you're repairing it yourself or having it really is the good

over and that was so many professional jobs\nNews Napa auto parts Wagner says it you don't want to do the job over the either\nAnd that's why you should ... also\nDo for a nap auto parts store near you go to a number online dot com and search for the store that has most convenient for you you'll also see a lot of meat specials has some very useful information so it's not a party

drop on Wall street you're like most investors nearing retirement he might be wondering how this is going to impact you\nMy colleague Megan mo Zack had the chance to sit down with financial educator and New York times best selling author David Box for and insightful conversation about what this volatility means for you and retirements let's listen in\nOctober ... saw the worst day where the Dow since February\nA big drop in popular tech stocks put any impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you and your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah David been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich\nAnd smart women finish rich and today he's co founder of Eighteen wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nWill Megan it's great to be with you even though you know it's a little ugly in the markets it's still great to be with you so thanks for having me on your show\nLet's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taking place over three or four days so you know we're over a thousand pointed down on the Dow in a handful days here and this is scaring people and and so the question becomes well is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful things\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed the actually been raising rates really since two thousand and tea but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can land they called the Federal Reserve fund to tour record happened in September\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a home if you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance that car\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's ...\n... spoke some market right because if you're well maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed and\nRates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and\nThose historical rate which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective um and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe Kenya treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three or the ten year treasuries over three point one five to as I speak that means if you go and buy a ten year treasury are going to get a rate of\nThree point one five ... percent and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happened and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't way like this right let me see if we see a sell off in tech stocks particularly\nTech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches with companies involved like Amazon and potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so there's been some so often these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective\nIt's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher company you know we call him fang companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google use main tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks pull back\nI think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um all this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally\nThe global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world\nUm and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um it's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognized that things\nAre slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nSo several components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street David I Want to go back to those rising rates I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees is special retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to\nTo reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement and the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if in most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries\n'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that the tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny 'cause because here's a nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe\nYou know I've done other interviews on um I Know that we're we've ... we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had\nAt the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy right like don't now it's not time to get greedy now's not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because\nIf you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford\nTake the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired your ... your comfort level was seeing your money drops significantly\nAnd I I often tell people ... who you might have all three of those I say hey\nI don't know if it was dumb luck or if it was by strategy but you did a great job letting these nine times out of ten they say oh it was dumb luck [laughter]\nAnd I think some of that's humility because I Know they didn't necessarily know how that was going to benefit them but they also knew you know okay there's benefits to having a Roth IRA versus a four one K. what we're doing is we're taking all these different tools and concepts that you've been accumulating over decades and we're helping putting it into a cohesive plan where they all fit together so\nI think that's kind of the first step that I Would mention and then it ties in to that idea of you know diversification of tax consequences\nIt is very important certainly to be thinking about how that's going to pay out in the example that I always use is\nIf you just have everything as tax would retirement what you might be in a twenty two or twenty four percent tax bracket our tax strategies we want to try and do is it's not that you're probably never going to pay any income taxes in retirement but what if we can lower those brackets\nHow about a ten or twelve percent federal tax brag instead of twenty two or twenty four percent those are the kinds of things that our clients can be very excited about and understand conceptually\nPatterns he talked about taxes I think one of the goals here is if we can save money on taxes we keep more of our money longer that can affect our retirement date as well right\nIt's a huge huge factor Jim because of course we want to help you make as much return on your investments as you can but it's not just what you make it's would you keep and so if you are investing in generating great returns but Uncle Sam is getting a larger portion of that\nThat certainly doesn't make sense right so we really want those pieces of the puzzle all fit together we can generate good returns and also help you minimize taxes as much as possible that's the ideal and you know when I talk about that that kind of ties into what exactly are you doing with the nest egg\nHow are we trying to generate those returns and that's where it comes back to that diversification so we talked about diversity in how you are taxed on your accounts we also want a tremendous amount of diversity on your investments and you know my soapbox speech on this topic is\nMost financial firms want you to be in a pool of stocks and bonds or funds because those are easy to manage for them\nAnd our philosophy is there's just so much more out there\nAnd you can have a tremendous amount more diversity and reduce your risk\nAnd you can just be a tremendous value to you in retirement we talk about there being three worlds of money in retirement so you have that stock market or mutual fund world and that's your growth world\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that that's where you have the potential for higher returns but you also have tremendous risk there as well on the other end of the spectrum you have the safe world so that's going to be accounts that have some type of account guaranteed to them that might be bank accounts or savings bombs or annuities have guarantees to them\nSo you're not going to of course expect as high of an average return on those accounts but they provide that safety that you need in retirement\nAnd then one of our areas that we work in a lot is the middle of the road ... let me call it a steady income world so these are\nNot guaranteed accounts they are investments but they're not designed for all of the ups and downs swings of the stock market and the economy they're designed usually to pay a nice steady income stream maybe five or six percent or something like that\nAnd that's one of those things when you're thirty or thirty five and you may be saving for retirement you're thinking well that doesn't sound appealing at all\nI can assure you when you get to sixty or sixty five that sounds a lot more interesting\nBecause you're switching away from this high growth long term mentality to how to preserve the principle as long as possible and generate as much income to enjoy my retirement so hopefully you can see how all these pieces kinda fit together or we figured out what you want to be doing in retirement of what's going to cost now we're kind of filling out your nest egg\nTo create accounts that are going to actually generate that income\nAnd allow you ultimately to enjoy the retirement you've always hope for and that's our goal that is why we offer are five step retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation to take advantage call right now at age ... three\nNine retire we have had a lot of interest recently saw a calendar is nearly full but we specifically set aside a few spots for listeners of today's show so call now eight oh three nine retire and mentioned the savior retirement radio show if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now at age ... three nine retire\nThat number again that had to share with you a a three nine retire or a oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nRetire with pat dot com it's a website if you'd like to learn a little bit more thanks for staying with us here today and said the retirement with pat ... as we talk about the different next he might have in your portfolio what you're trying to do is make sure your portfolio is not going to move\nAll and the same direction and when you have it set up that way\nIt probably won't capture the highest of high rise\nBut it also shouldn't hit the lowest of lows re\nThat's perfectly said Gen if you think about maybe at any point in your life have you had all of your investments in the stock market you know if you have a great run it in the market over a year or two you might be a mix thirty or forty or fifty percent of your money which is of course incredibly exciting but we've all experienced two thousand eight and if you've been investing long enough two thousand two thousand and one\nWhere the market within a year or two dropped in half\nSo you can make as much as the person or lose as much as a fifty percent\nAnd maybe that's okay if you've got a couple of thousand dollars in a stock you're playing around with\nBut it's a whole another story if you've taken your whole life savings and have it there so all we're doing is if you can picture me kind of with my hands real high for the higher returning low fat low return or just trying to ... those hands closer together\nAnd narrow that range and of course we'd love to have as much of that up so [laughter] this weekend and we want to eliminate that risk on the downside as much as we can\nAnd of course you have to understand there is no such thing as an investment that has a really high return with no risk that just doesn't exist what we're trying to do is use all the tools available\nTo help you narrow down that range and that's where we believe our expertise lives because we are not investing for thirty year olds for high growth we are investing for people that are in their last five ten Fifteen Years before retirement and then throughout retirement\nAnd if we can generate a nice income stream off of that portfolio have the potential for some growth and reduce your risk as much as possible that is what most people are excited about when they're coming in and talking with us\nThat when we talk about having the right next to the assets for us send our unique situation if we aren't sure if that's what we truly has is it a good idea to get a second opinion from someone like you\nI think that can be a tremendous value Gen and of course you want to make sure\nYou're getting a second opinion that is not gonna apply pressure to you we truly mean that our processes zero cost and zero expectation on our end because it's just an opportunity for us to get together with you and get to know you and we certainly are not the perfect planning for for every single person\nOr we're certainly not big enough to be able to work with every person so we're trying to find people that were a great fit with and we know that's what you're trying to do as well\nSo whether you are handling your finances yourself\nOr you're working with some type of financial professional we just see tremendous value and getting a second opinion because if you're on the right track isn't it nice to hear from someone else yes we run the numbers and you're doing really well and if there's something off\nThan you certainly would want to know and then the third possibility as young as it's a different philosophy and I love to talk with you about that and I say you know if you're doing something that's working okay\nRight now and I say if you're interested in seeing what our philosophy would look like I said the one thing that I can tell you that I think you'll have tremendous peace of mind about is nothing we're gonna come back and show you is going to look exactly like what you have\nSo we're not going to say oh we're slightly better this or that we're going to show you something completely different because most financial firms are designed more for growth their design more for someone in their thirties maybe into their forties and what we're doing something completely different\nA retirement plan to take you from the five ten years before retirement into in through retirement and so it's going to look very different and that doesn't mean it's right for you but it should make that decision easier for you to look at and say okay I see where perhaps from is coming from but maybe I don't agree with that maybe I Want to have high growth for further\nInto my life into retirement or maybe I'm not concerned about those five different ... retirement I just want to have a portfolio it's going to generate as much returned as it possibly can and so that's the beauty of the process is getting a second opinion\nFrom a retirement specialist really can help you see ultimately coming back to your question Jim hey are we on track\nAnd is our allocations set up appropriately for us in that ties into a number of things first of all how old are you how far off from retirement are you how much of your income do you need to generate off of your portfolio and then we also need to talk through all those things that are really individual to use such as", "show_name":
