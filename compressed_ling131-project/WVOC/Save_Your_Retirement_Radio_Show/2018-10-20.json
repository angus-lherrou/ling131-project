{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "All right well I Know we're tied on time and we got to give them the hundred and Seventy seven million dollar fistfight oh it's going to be fighting in the streets coming up with Jonathan\nJoe W. B. O.\nHigh scary David went in and I decided to upgrade our counter tops we look for a company with a great selection great prices\nAnd one of the prides itself on installation in customer service we found all that and more with lifetime cabinets and counter tops I can tell you this if you can't find exactly what you're looking for a while you're there and that's rare they'll find it for you\nThey cut and install your counter tops it'll form it out to a third party contractor they do it all was Sharon's on the front of the in the run and Colombia and shaping run in shape and granted marble courts courtside they've got it all seem on Facebook had lifetime Kevin countertops will call seven seven to twenty to twenty\nFront of our ... our our local hospitals around how\nPowerful\nAre only going to run around for ... hanging from harmful [noise]\n[laughter]\nThanks for being\nHere this is Jonathan monsters Kelly and asked what great news Kelly a hundred and Seventy seven million dollar surplus\nYou know in the budget for the state of South Carolina\nWe ought to sue the media and anybody else who says it's a surplus because you can't have a surplus when you're this far in debt we are billions\nIn debt and and we are it's not like you know we should we even say who is we worked for a company who tried to explain to us the debt of our company the same way you would explain the debt of your mortgage as long as you can make that monthly nuts what difference does it make right [laughter] so [laughter] you know that's\nRight yeah we're we're we're a couple of billion dollars in debt ourselves over here but hey as long as they keep exactly except the differences on my mortgage I didn't have a balloon payment that was coming due in about a month\nNo matter how you describe but when you put it out on the excel spreadsheet and that line comes across and you've got a hundred and Seventy seven million that goes over to the final line that gives you your total yeah that also includes your outstanding debt you're still in the red\nAnd that's the problem the the we have billions that we do currently like now not like somewhere in the future\nFor the ah employees pension funds here in South Carolina they're all going to be screwed who are they gonna who are they well they are the people who they are representative Carlton, Washington\nHead of the south Carolina state employees association is fighting hard for and he says there's a hundred and Seventy seven million dollar budget surplus this is what we need to do one time bonuses were going to split evenly between the eighty thousand state workers in the eighty thousand a public school teachers so it's eighty eight and a half million dollars for each one of\nThose people Carlton you're missing the bigger picture here my man that that we don't have a surplus and it'd be great if they could get you know a few hundred dollars into a one time a bonus thing\nBut you need to figure out a way to address the fact that their pensions are missing they're gone your pension that you've been waiting your whole life for that you weren't told you're going to retire with like twenty eight thousand dollars a year you're going to get nothing would have\nGotten so you're looking bird in the hands were too in the Bush we already know this is not going to be to cover the unfunded mandate we have to the liabilities currently for the workers for the state of South Carolina we want our money now\nOkay Carlton if you want the hundred bucks and be on your way than there you go just call it a call it a career wrap it up here's a hundred dollars thanks for your twenty five years of service of war however there is still time if the people at the top huge Letterman\nAnd others would start investing the money properly and not peddling it away on their in laws and other relatives or we could figure out a way to save the pension fund\nAnd that it's so important because and and if you're thinking well I'm a whole bunch and I don't don't matter to me I didn't even get promised a pension oh I didn't get one either by the way I don't have a pension coming\nBut I also have the ability as a free market employee to go out here and make more money than a state employee has the opportunity today signed up for that job I understand a lot of it's driven by passion for the kids or whatever sure but it's also on the promise that when you retire\nWe got you you're not going to make a whole lot during your career but when you retire your your retirement years aren't going to suck as hard as somebody else who didn't manage their money properly except we didn't manage their money properly and their retirement they got nothing in their career that got nothing waiting for him now either\nWell and this came up the other night in the debate in age Maggie the right answer we need to pay down this this a debt we have yes\nThat we can't afford they rose everyday faster than we can afford it and even with this money applied to what you're still going to be in that yeah and he even and called out he loved them and who was in the crowd what does he loves them and doing their the debate the other night I don't know if it harms he runs everything you're well that's true too I forgot\nBut he ... age Mac did have the correct answer for this and what was James Smith censor um J. Smith says he but he went into this thing about how he's going to pay the teachers more without having to raise the taxes and all this stuff so\nYou got magic money he dies apparently but the the bottom line ... man mama [laughter]\nThe frightening thing for every taxpayer is that if we do not get a handle on this ... this is the biggest financial expense that South Carolina has come and do and there's a due date everyday nearly because you have teachers and worker workers for the state of South Carolina retiring out of the system and they're starting to draw their money out\nLet me just explain that to you again a hundred and sixty thousand people are suddenly going to become dependent completely\nOn on welfare that's right the ... they were supposed to be contributing to the economy they had planned on it they have actually worked for it they are overloaded and instead of them be being able to be viable ... citizens who can go into the stores and buy things and participate and\nFarmers and drive the economy up they are going to be a drag on the economy is huge drag\nAnd so we're all going to suffer big time for this ... we're gonna talk about this more and more and more because this one grows faster than we can put a stop doing it even with the one\nSeventy seven million but we'll see how it is up but guess what I'm saying [noise]\nTo Jonathan and Kelly show when you show a terrible something wonderful [noise]\nW.

...\nThanks for joining us today on save your retirement with ... on your hosts generally jak here alongside pat you know we recently saw a precipitous drop on Wall street if you're like most investors nearing retirement you might be wondering how this is going to impact you\nMy colleague Megan mowers ... had the chance to sit down with financial educator and New York times best selling author David Baake for and insightful conversation about what this volatility means for you and retirement let's listen in\nOctober tenth saw the worst day where they down since February\nA big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finished rich and smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of the aim wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nAnd it's great to be with you even though you know it's a little ugly in the markets it's still a great show\nLet's talk about that an eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked this sell off\nWell it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taken place over three or four so you know over a thousand pointed down on the handful you're scaring people and and so the question becomes all is there anything that's going on and I'll give him\nThe first thing is that right and you even heard the president talk well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is\nActually been raising rates really but most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can call that was fun to own a court [noise]\nAnd when those rates went up a couple of things first of all the cost or a money goes right so you're going to borrow money for if you're going to refinance if you're going to buy a car you're going to finance\nOr you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your or owing money the cost to borrow that money you know and that's\nAll folks the market right because if you're well maybe people will either by less home they'll refinance so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop but\nIt costs more to borrow money the markets can loop that consumers will slow down on there and\nSo that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe bad and rate going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low ridge well over ten years and those historic that put in place after our great recession\nAnd I I often tell people what gender you might have all three of those I say hey\nI don't know if it was dumb luck or if it was my strategy but you just raised up\nYou're letting these nine times out of time they say oh it was dumb luck [laughter]\nAnd I think some of that's humility because I Know they didn't necessarily know how\nThat was going to benefit them but they also knew you know okay there's benefits to having a Roth IRA rape versus the four one K. what we're doing is we're taking all these different tools and concepts that you've been accumulating over decades and we're helping putting it into a cohesive plan where they all fit together so I think that's kind of the first step that I Would mention\nAnd then it ties in to that idea of you know diversification of tax consequences\nIt is very important certainly to be thinking about how that's going to pay out in the example that I always use is\nIf you just have everything is taxable retirement will you might be twenty two or twenty four percent tax bracket our tax strategies we want to try and do is it's not that you probably never going to pay any income taxes and retirement but what if we can lower those brackets\nHow about a ten or twelve percent federal tax bragging to twenty two or twenty four percent of those are the kinds of things that are ... can be very excited about and understand conceptually\nPatterns he talked about taxes I think one of the goals here is if we can save money on taxes we keep more of our money longer that can affect our retirement date as well right\nIt's a huge huge factor Jim because of course we want to help you make as much return on your investments as you can but it's not just what you make it would you keep and so if you are investing in generating great returns but Uncle Sam is getting a larger portion of that\nThat certainly doesn't make sense right so we really want those pieces of the puzzle all fit together if we can generate good returns and also help you minimize taxes as much as possible that the ideal and you know when I talk about that that kind of ties into what exactly are you doing with the nest egg\nHow are we trying to generate those returns and that's where it comes back to that diversification so we talked about diversity in how you are taxed on your accounts\nWe also want a tremendous amount of diversity on your investments and you know my soapbox speech on this topic is most financial firms want you to be in a pool of stocks and bonds or funds because those are easy to manage for them\nAnd our philosophy is there's just so much more out there and you can have a tremendous amount more diversity and reduce your risk\nAnd you can just be a tremendous value to you in retirement we talk about there being three worlds of money in retirement so you have that stock market or mutual fund world and that's your growth world\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that that's where you have the potential for high returns but you also have tremendous risk there as well on the other end of the spectrum you have the safe world so that's going to be accounts that have some type of account guaranteed to them that might be bank accounts or savings bonds or annuities have guarantees to them\nSo you're not going to of course expect as high of an average return on those accounts but they provide that safety that you need in retirement\nAnd then one of our areas that we work in a lot is the middle of the road world we call it a steady income world so these are\nNot guaranteed accounts they are investments but they're not designed for all of the ups and downs to an swings of the stock market and the economy they're designed usually to pay a nice steady income stream maybe five or six percent or something like that\nAnd that's one of those things when you're thirty or thirty five and you may be saving for retirement you're thinking well that doesn't sound appealing at all\nI can assure you when you get to sixty or sixty five that sounds a lot more interesting\nBecause you're switching away from this high growth long term mentality to okay how do I preserve the principle as long as possible and generate as much income to enjoy my retirement so hopefully you can see how all these pieces fit together\nOr we figured out what you want to be doing in retirement what is going to cost now we're kind of filling out your nest egg\nTo create accounts that are going to actually generate that income and allow you ultimately to enjoy the retirement you've always hope for and that's our goal that's why we offer are five step retirement review it absolutely no cost in no obligation to take advantage call right now is a two or three\nNine retire we have had a lot of interest recently saw a calendar is nearly full but we specifically set aside a few spots for listeners of today's show so call now eight oh three nine retire and mentioned the savior retirement radio show if you said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now at age ... three nine retire\nThat number again that had to share it Hugh eight oh three nine retire or a oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nRetire with pat dot com it's a website if you'd like to learn a little bit more thanks for staying with us here today and said your retirement with ... as we talk about the different neck he might have in your portfolio what you're trying to do is make sure your portfolio is not going to move\nAll and the same direction and when you have it set up that way\nIt probably won't capture the highest price\nBut it also shouldn't hit the lowest of lows re\nThat's perfectly said Gen if you think about maybe at any point in your life have you had all of your investments in the stock market you know if you have a great run in the market over a year or two you might be a mix thirty or forty or fifty percent on your money which is of course incredibly exciting but we've all experienced two thousand eight and if you've been investing long enough two thousand two thousand one\nWhere the market within a year or two dropped in half\nSo you can make as much as ... percent or lose as much as ... percent\nAnd maybe that's okay if you've got a couple of thousand dollars in a stock you're playing around with\nBut it's a whole another story if you've taken your whole life savings and have it there so all we're doing is if you can picture me kind of with my hands real high for that high returning low for the lower turnout is trying to ... those hands closer together\nAnd narrow that range and of course we'd love to have as much of that up so we can and we want to eliminate that risk on the downside as much as we can\nAnd of course you have to understand there is no such thing as an investment has a really high returned with no risk that just doesn't exist so what we're trying to do is use all the tools available\nTo help you narrow down that range and that's where we believe our expertise lives because we are not investing for thirty year olds for high growth we are investing for people that are in their last five ten Fifteen Years before retirement and then throughout retirement\nAnd if we can generate a nice income stream off of that portfolio have the potential for some growth and reduce your risk as much as possible that is what most people are excited about when they're coming and talking with us\nWhen we talk about having the right next to the assets for us then are unique situation if we aren't sure if that's what we truly has is it a good idea to get a second opinion from someone like you\nWell I think they can be a tremendous value Gen and of course you want to make sure\nYou're getting a second opinion that is not gonna apply pressure to you we truly mean that our processes zero cost and zero expectation on our end because it's just an opportunity for us to get together with you and get to know you and we certainly are not the perfect planning for for every single person\nAnd we're certainly not big enough to be able to work with every person so we're trying to find people that were a great fit with and we know that's what you're trying to do as well\nSo whether you are handling your finances yourself\nOr you're working with some type of financial professional we just see tremendous value and getting a second opinion because if you're on the right track isn't it nice to hear from someone else yes we've run the numbers and you're doing really well and if there's something off\nThen you certainly would want to know and then the third possibility as young as it's a different philosophy and I love to talk with people about that and I say you know if you're doing something that's working okay right now\nAnd I say if you're interested in seeing what our philosophy was looked like I said the one thing that I can tell you that I think you'll have tremendous peace of mind about is nothing we're gonna come back and show you is going to look exactly like what you have\nSo we're not going to say oh we're slightly better this or that we're going to show you something completely different because most financial firms are designed more for growth they're designed more for someone in their thirties maybe into their forties and what we're doing something completely different\nA retirement plan to take you from the five ten years before retirement into in through retirement and so it's going to look very different and that doesn't mean it's right for you but it should make that decision easier for you to look at and say okay I see where paths for him is coming from but maybe I don't agree with that maybe I Want to have high growth for further\nInto my life into retirement or maybe I'm not concerned about those five different areas retirement I just want to have a portfolio it's going to generate as much returned as it possibly can\nAnd so that's the beauty of the process is getting a second opinion from a retirement specialist really can help you see ultimately coming back to your question Jim hey are we on track\nAnd is our allocations set up appropriately for us in that ties into a number of things first\nWell how old are you how far off from retirement are you how much of your income do you need to generate off of your portfolio and then we also need to talk through all those things that are really individual to use such as your personality your comfort with risk your desire for growth\nYou know what does that retirement going to look like is it more of a jet setting traveled the world type of retirement or is it more of a home body stay home type of scenario\nAnd that's really important to make sure it's personalized for all of those types of things that's why we offer are five step retirement review with absolutely no cost and no obligation because it gives you the opportunity to talk to someone who is a specialist in the retirement area\nAnd give you a customized assessment to help you review and help you see are you on track\nFor when you want to retire in to accomplish the goals and the lifestyle you're trying to accomplish in retirement\nAnd to also put your nest egg through a portfolio stress tests to help you see if you're taking the amount of risk but you believe you're taking and ultimately help you try to match up your retirement income to support those goals that we talked about earlier to get started cost and that it was three\nNine retire it you said at least two
