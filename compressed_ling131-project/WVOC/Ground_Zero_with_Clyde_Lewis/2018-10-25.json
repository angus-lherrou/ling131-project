would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate nation of violence\nTo solve any and all dispute now I Know that that's
