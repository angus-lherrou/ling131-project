Michelangelo's my wife is goofing off a friend in Islam hats and we had turtle shells as well Steven you guys look great man I I Love it you know a whole family and into turtle costumes\nTeenage mutant ninja turtles I've I've always been a fan of and I really liked the cartoon growing up and then also even the first major turtles movie I saw that so many times I really I really enjoyed it of people thought it was kind of intense and violent at the time if you go back in\nAnd check it out you'll you'll see what I mean but it was a good movie I really enjoyed it and it's a really creative concept who would think that turtles\nIn a nuclear waste\nNamed after renaissance painters who have ninja skills would be a hate well it was there you have it Gary hey book greetings from team buck Hungary I took her advice and started watching the first season of picky blinders\n'em and last night it was awesome hook thanks for the recommendation\nI'm all for the next week and that is what I'd be doing in the evenings lover you do brother keep it up shields Hi Gary Gary ... and I'm so glad you liked the blinders on I really I really do enjoy it I I think it's a very entertaining very well done very entertaining show a little bleak for sure but\nIt's ah it's well executed the writing is good and and there's some very interesting twists and turns in it I I started watching\nThe third season of daredevil all over the weekend which I Would have to say you know the thing about daredevil is that it it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is I just can't understand how they made daredevil such a compelling show at\nNetflix and they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage\nIn iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set of New York same you know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens because it was such\nA piece of of waste and ah anyway but yeah I I have to say I think that daredevil three so far as it's a little slow and getting going but so far it's ... it's pretty well\nDone I find the acting all very good I I enjoy the performance is even if you're not in that industry Burr hero stuff I think you might like daredevil I I think you might find daredevil to be a pretty good show a Carla ... wash U and ... the other day with a B\nLoved her comment about someone writing his comments about the bomber on teleprompter like no one ever did that before I Love the show so all the pick of you and your parents in D.C looks like your dad has the same swoop\nCarla thank you for that kind of comments about my parents I'm Bret Baer I I think that I was able to say exactly what I really wanted to you on the circumstances which is always which I think is a very important for whenever you get one of those performances whenever you're doing that I also went on Shannon show on friday as you guys know\nSo that was another chance for me to say what was really on my mind uh and uh after my dad yeah my dad has great hair it's true great hair he's got he's got a silver swoop now in fact I could probably be his call signs silver scoop\nBut it was so good to see my parents um I've got the best parents in the world so that's\nA big advantage that I've had in life you know I Know you've probably got great parents too but other than your parents are probably the second best parents world I think modern number one but we can agree to disagree on that\nUh so it was it was great to see them we a lot of fun and it's nice to get some visitors down here in the swat man the swamp can feel a little little lonely not enough team bucking the swamp got to be honest with you guys are spread out all around the country and a lot of you are in states where you've got you've got fellow patriots all around\nYou're not like me deep behind enemy lines can be crazy\nLet's see you miss the rides what do those of us in liberal California do about the ...\nWe are surrounded by these crazies well\nYou know it's uh there's no easy answers um I Wish I could say that I had a a straightforward do this to tell you but I you know I think you engage where you can and that's it you know you you do where do you think it's a bad idea\nIt's not worth it sometimes Jennifer right table yesterday I attended a lecture presentation by Arthur Sulzberger Germany in New York Times called the impact of media and truth on democracy I went with an open mind is I always try to approach things in life this way because many people surprise me over the years\nHowever I found Sulzberger statements so cliche is an interesting he said all the things you talked about recently on your show speaking truth to power how we live in dangerous times journalist or unsafe et cetera et cetera I lost track of how many times to use the words danger or dangerous\nHowever he's definitely a capitalist he bragged about on the New York times successfully mounted monetize their online media and when asked a question from the audience about how the New York times could be more accessible middle class Sulzberger said the cost of ... New York times is worth it or get the truth\nWhen you find yourself in northern California again I could ... have you speak at our local university we need to hear a more conservative voices especially on campuses in California keep finding a good fight shields Hi Jennifer\nOh thank you Jennifer for that interesting perspective and and telling me what's going on with that sold burger lecture that that's not surprising at all by the way the New York times is in many ways the most arrogant\nOf all media out there and the and it's left wing and I don't know how many of you saw at the last week I asked their chief White House correspondent for the New York times are you a liberal paper and he said no\nAnd I just look at them like dude I I understand that you know that's the that's the company line but come on it really\nWe're we're going to do this we're really going to do the New York times is not liberal because oh the editorial pages liberal but the overall\nPaper is is just a newspaper no that is not true the New York times as liberal paper and they should just own it you know that they shouldn't beat around the Bush and pretend or something that they're not I don't see this is really all that\nComplicated I really don't but they they make it complicated because they like\nThe pretense of being neutral they think that neutrality and objectivity\nHeightens the strength of their voice whereas if they admitted to partisanship even though they're hyper partisan then they could not claimed to just be this is a true objectivity they're clearly not that\nI Will stop what's ah what's up with this one a book\nYou miss the anniversary of the battle of a parent or bread and your right I Am so sorry\nI forgot to tell you guys all about ... if you want to go to go to Google and type in the ... show and the battle of ... and you can listen to the old ... old time sick you're right I did miss ... anniversary this year though I'm I'm slipping in my old age Tyler writes love your show man shield side Tyler\nYou're the man thank you I'm gonna end on that tonight because I like it shield Saudi do and to all of your own home ...\n[noise] it might have seen the headlines from last week or so now they're starting to blame social media sites that don't do enough in order to get rid of the content that they decide is violent who's day\nOh that's right the left wing media the people that are trying to tell you that there are progressive ideology\nJust so happens to constantly result in the censorship of conservative but you know it's the algorithm man there's nothing really going on there\nMalarkey you know if you want a place where you can go and share your thoughts that Snoopy dot com [noise] I've got to be dot com account and I love being able to interact with folks there and read their postings and know that the post is the post okay\nYou get to have your opinion heard you don't have to worry about any of the progressive censorship or nonsense from Facebook sniffy dot com\nThousands of team buck folks have already signed up and join you should check it out for yourself as an I.
