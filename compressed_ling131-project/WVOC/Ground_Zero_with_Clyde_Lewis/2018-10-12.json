hubbub around calving although\nLet me let me rethink that for a moment because this capital things blowing back on Democrats are hoping to move past this moment because it does not look good for them and you're seeing is in the polls and Democrats are hoping that there is not a greater awareness of just how much of an effect the whole backlash\nAgainst the Kavanaugh hit\nThey thought it would be a backlash against cabinet getting on the court we're actually seeing a backlash against the hit on Kavanaugh and that\nCould be a a game changer in the winter and we'll see what I'm saying it might be

out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the ... violence to Georgia wow that's respected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have instability until we get what we want and claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is this measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this when we got Republicans are being shot stabbed docks be mailed a a rice in powder run out of restaurants sent death threats and yet she says we got to be an civil until we get what we

stands nothing Hillary Clinton said actually suggested violets are really really ... the opposite of civil is not\nViolent it is rude now I Know that they're being very push ally and dangerously rude but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet ... does not have a party ... a lot I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party\nThey don't even have a left right there a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone [noise] what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting out the black lots and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that most ... you prove this the other night when you did your show that\nMost Americans have no idea what\nThe word civil war means it does not mean a civil war no not necessarily all\nMeans no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means\nIt means within state instead of with other states that is what civil war means and that'd be a new civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go do a the pilots said the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the worst civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word\nAs I said it's a dog whistle itself settled that you didn't pick up on it wow she all she had it was dropped that word because it confuses too many people\nAnd that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but she's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nWhat in that case then she's going to have a backfire on her when you agree\nWhat do you mean\nWell I mean if she was too if it was a dog whistle and and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards the conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes and she'd I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it is obviously you got the New York post printing out newspapers said ah do you want to go into this declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no control as Hillary done me controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want the civil war\nAnd the media doesn't know it ... doesn't know it to be strapped doesn't know it to the D. said basically are you using the media to manipulate civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary as pawns in in in the whole matrix that's an any Leno I yeah I did this begin to hate the word hate the word ape state but yes what you're saying\nWell if you say is real I mean come on what you want to call\nIt I don't want to get
