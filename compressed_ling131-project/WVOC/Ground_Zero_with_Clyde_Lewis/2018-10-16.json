I was gonna say a flock of per on us but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging Peron has a ... they they would have turned him apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and and objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear every day yes I like to present information and there's an aspect\nOf this that's a really just about dare I say it's far from the left community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I quit for\nThose who listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process\nOf of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and it has never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time Brad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home shields on thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the podcast is out sooner\nAnd I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast knows we're pretty much now our podcast is going up for this show for the buck Sexton show\nIn drive time on the west coast so you know you there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait\nAnd wait for it to be rebroadcast or to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the on the podcast however you consume puck is uh and so that's great news that you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary under a security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just completely it should've been terrifically embarrassing\nFor anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense that she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nOn her mind you all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends that stands for research it'll be about what's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to buck event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free\nBook events dot com and getting ...

let's play a word association game I say a word and you tell me the first thing that comes to your mind really keen it'll be fun you ready first word Columbus\nDay pumpkin I Try to ... ... yeah\nWow

custom furniture orders up to thirty percent off hand crafted furniture made to order\nNeed a new mattress no problems ... parts are on sale too but what about the ...\n... ... each day hey you won't have to eat it was\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state\nWhich is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations\nAnd I don't know how you defined I Divide that this worldwide fascism and it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together a green the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order and wants to take over to go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\nSo high Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name 'cause so he\nCould show again like I had known to show gets ...\n... you know\nSo you had a [noise] the Turks came out and\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise]\nWell if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of\nAny nation states sending Fifteen people to do it yet I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is ah between a rock and a hard spot now because\nYou're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket it would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen\nTrump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot this hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide beads stay manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWould this is this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy or Asian or look at\nThe un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate\nNow how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs a Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN or it's I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh the gloom out of the country\nSlide if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it team\nProbably do the same reason or you say that you would in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it well but\nBut you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be arguments the CIA was facilitating operation deep laid off in the argument that he said operatives in the high a score facilitators to the murder of is a good show gay\nAnd of course Saudi Arabia and as a B C D operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can be gives a tremendous pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you wouldn't want an incident does an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got Bolton who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yup then they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even on that I think they went by the last number of your plate\nSo I remember I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my we had two cars so I'd have my wife gets up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day\nAnd then that they should gas up the other car\nAnd because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now if they fall back on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means or that we're going to pull back or or oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it would be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily by Chris I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea that the thing is for the bait and retaliate it's\nAll watch and wait now right and that's why I brought this up because this I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about ... and I thought what am I talked about and then I realized oh I Know what this says I looked it over and I figured\nWell gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America these stabilizes from the pump it stabilizes with inflation destabilize this with an economy that's going to go bust and then what will we have\nRight and and I have cut ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible that this is a a a\nForm of a ... within Saudi Arabia to build interest curve to ah serve to help a turkey get back in that race is we'll see what happens Peter we'll see what happens right now I I look don't it doesn't look too good Peter Banks have received a call ... like Tripoli fix up at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nWhere my\nAnd I mean\n\n\nHang\nHey it's my kid to back him center it's allergy season in South Carolina Thirteen months out of the year you know at the back in the Senate we don't sell back and we also sell air purifier\nSo if you do have allergies got those itchy eyes and the runny nose we can solve the problem we sell world class air purification from the ... to Everest electrolytes seal air purifiers with the lights it'll kill bacteria germs in your house you'll be amazed at the difference an air purifier will make in the air quality in your home stopped by the vacuum center by\nForty to knock the EPA Dr Casey a lead back from center dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe use of greens mayor for terrifying attractions in one location designed to\nColleges and universities play an important role in preventing drug abuse among their student joined the drug Enforcement Administration and celebrate red ribbon week from October twenty third\nThrough the thirty first you can plant education and prevention activities on your campus to help ensure that health and safety of our nation's college students for more information\nOn how you present this one's ... del platform in Nineteen sixty eight the more powerful ... made the el camino into one of the iconic muscle cars in the late Nineteen sixties and seventies it's weak in Nineteen eighty seven and an event that had and he was around the world glued to their televisions\nEighteen month old Jessica ... she became known baby Jessica is rescued after being trapped for fifty eight hours in a band in water well in Midland, Texas and this week in two thousand seven comedian and actor drew Carey takeover hosting duty on the grounds of Sandy Waxman and we take a journey back to this week in sports history\nStarted way back in Eighteen sixty were the first professional golf tournament is held a press put golf club in Scotland\nGolf or by the name of really park\nWhen the tournament this week in Nineteen oh to the seven iron bowl is played for Auburn, Alabama twenty three to nothing in Birmingham today the Auburn, Alabama rivalry has had eighty two meetings and Alabama leads forty five thirty six\nThis audio is for your review and now for ...
