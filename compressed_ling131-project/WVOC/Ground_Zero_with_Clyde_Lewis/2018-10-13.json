Want everyone to remember I I Do think he's more of a Roberts type justice where he's going to try judicial ...\nOr from the bench now we're generally as conservatives because we are trying to conserve right where we're OK with judicial minimal ism but just understand that that means that he probably won't be in a position to give a do things that conservatives really want\nI'm All right uh

to the moon that's what I meant and so you know all about the efforts of the Gemini program the Apollo program\nYou know the deaths that happened before or the testing but see a lot of people you know point to that did that for Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people\nAre also a stepped up and said I don't believe in the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all this time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two guys want a space odyssey took time for there to the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film as James Bond gets on a a a moon landing set\nNineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One movie

moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually with a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut ah it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon when Al Cross a rocket\nWill cratered the ministry if there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had survey ers and landers and and orbiters mapped the moon Clementine actually mapping Nineteen Ninety four and a crime in China was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations or that they were bad to enter L A ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images\nSo\nEverything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless you across mission was a failure bronco Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told that the moon is the gold again what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientist often to report stating that searching for signs of life\nShould be part of every future national NASA mission at the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing and says that\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include\nA studies that astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nBut I think it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the grammatical waves are in fact Russian scientists to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of Senate sop alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\n[noise] and in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that air it was because of that\nAh but in recent years we in the show has been discussing that thousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also\nWe went to the moon only TV\nAnd believe me they can do a lot of things with TV\nAnd a lot of things they did would be for people to do a lot of things on a movie set to that's why push ban is in theater\nAs they can fake it and they can pick it back then to\nTo really take seven three

three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nGo to Michael in Oregon Hi Michael you're on ground zero\nBy longtime first I think you you know all about it\nI just enjoy your show but I'm about that ... that if you think about it what what more genius way to blow up somebody thinking he got more technology than yeah\nVideo pick of landing right well I don't know if they did or not I'm just saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this a T Barnes was on the show when they could be classified some ox carts project ... card with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us\nHe said that the new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put cardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft oh I remember something you know they used they used to put a fake aircraft the big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways review if you wanted to pull the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I I mean so they're putting putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac fifty one that could easily uh put together some you know great soil put it somewhere on the sound stage and uh and make it happen they they could easily\nDo that I mean I don't see why it it's beyond the pale the thing they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a of a ... model just like they did a you know for Star Wars I mean\nWhat Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nA what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean you would have thought miniatures so advanced\nWould give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell\nThat's very true yeah yeah and they they could possibly do it but uh you know and then another thing I don't think our scientists now have the engineering backgrounds as they get for now but back then as well so that could be another thing why they're not coming up with things you know if you think about it\nThey're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be a moon or half of them oh well I have a magnetic signature yes see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they are they just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want you all do you know when you do your measured there's got to have some sort of a plan to find daily life whatever you do prevent conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to you know ...\nYeah right yeah when I have to weigh out at the right way\nI ... either way I I think I Will come out in the next few years whether that it or not it'll have to\nWell I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean they were going to go back on their ideas already went to the moon but thinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs all kinds of crazy stuff I mean what if he said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know who gave me a little bit of money you act you know you\nRead this or this little space race it a little more interesting and you know I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge you drew a race that I Am compared to like the fat kid", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "13"}
