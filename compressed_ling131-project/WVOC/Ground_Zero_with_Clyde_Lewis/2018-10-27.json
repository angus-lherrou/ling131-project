coming to us from official team bucket Gmail dot com or what if God Forbid there was another attack like nine eleven would we do the Iraq invasion thing again to another country trying to hunt the perpetrators in their home country or not walk but basically what would be our response in this day and age I'm curious because the whole side\nOf situation so let me know um if there was another nine eleven would we hunt them in their home country uh yes the answer is yes Kyle in fact I think if there was another nine eleven\nWe would probably take a more World War two version of what our response would be which is a mass destruction of any area that we think plays a was giving safe haven to them um I think the American people's rafts if there were another day when we lost three thousand people in one terrorist attack\nWould be a fearsome and biblical thing\nThat's my that's my sense of it but you know it would depend on a lot of factors Andrew writes book I'm thirty eight years old and never voted in the mid term election just presidential years this year the exact uh exception I'm so sick of the crowd the Democrats are pulling\nThat I made sure my registration was up to date and

passion though I still try and do my part by opening my mouth and speaking up oddly enough I became a conservative while in prison\nWhat better model of socialism communism do we have than state or federal prison the pay to play corruption and complete sense of powerlessness will stay with me forever definitely gives me a healthy love for freedom and our constitutional republic\nLately I think Republicans fears a felon voting is misplaced is purely anecdotal but all the possible liberties I encountered in prison probably wouldn't go to ... their lives depended on it and not very impressive people that's kinda where they send us keep up the good fight shields high in Georgia Matt Matt ... really interesting here for\nA man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a has

the dot com presenting the world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't huge national jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date [noise]\nHi Dave let's talk about that job you posted for a senior manager okay I've got a lot of applicants already\nTape you posted on that huge national job site what a waste one guy says he's been everything from top block or two a stay at home uncle\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity\nBut he said that he will hardly think I shall meet the test its power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry or do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada lots of rights from the United states to sell their own version of the laser board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean everybody's fine I mean you know at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual smoother it's going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of the wrong type a board and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you are in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned people do make around and start customized and selling them\nOn but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money and there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you did you reach tricked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because we checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward 'cause I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on I Would just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which was on like channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like on the show he did like producing I think ... by current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nLike it's the same image to same exact [noise]\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything you know\nIn the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they will I told them everything you know and they\nPut it down but they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know got to I'd I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happened this really works\nAnd it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nSo I always say they just shot a joke\nNo um I don't want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever used where I'm used to board a long time let's be honest I used to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace they had a a crystal glass so they use a billboard screw rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV\nAnd by Louis you would see ground zero about\n\n\nA you know\nAnd\n\nAnd\nA you know\nLittle hard to do this summer when you're in your living room carpets too frightened to what the parents may
