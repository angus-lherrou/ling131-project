writes a book I'll keep as a short as possible your show last night hit home when it came to how the left has radicalized at a form of psychological warfare is now going on not just with prominent figures like yourself supporting the president or espousing conservative principles\nBut also regular folks like myself where if you outwardly express your belief in small government individual

extra listing taking care of the fight daily shields high uh\nYeah I I think you've got the right idea if this is not\nYour path I mean if you do not actually work in conservative media don't suffer the consequences publicly of being a conservative unnecessarily now\nThat doesn't mean don't be a conservative because you're a conservative in how you act every day and how you deal with other people and how you view yourself as a citizen in this country are and you're also a conservative in the actions you take to support other conservatives\nSo while it is certainly a helpful for me and for the

they should say what country to go to you and where to go in that country how much money they can ask for and expect and what to claim\nThat is why Europe has been filling with refugees fleeing economy's not war Europe has been deliberately flooded by these people the efforts in pamphlets were professionally printed and uniform I suspect a similar effort is taking place out\nOf our border it seems there's a deliberate attempt to flood the west with people who not integrate a and deliberate effort among the intelligence services in Europe and especially Germany to destroy any patriotic
