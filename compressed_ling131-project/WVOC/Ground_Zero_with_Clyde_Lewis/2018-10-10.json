right now I Believe in a civil war\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs not two sides fighting against each other whether there are two sides broke liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're seeing somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups\nAnd we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support your attention occasional ... and then this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points about things like gun control\nThings like immigration\nAnd it's not just that we're radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne next remark immediately we returning to a political football they bring back Murphy\nBrown it's a political football capitalistic kneeling a political football\n\nYou know we have a hurricane right now heading for the Gulf Coast Michael now will be about loss of life it won't be about property damage will be about whether or not it's global warming\nThis is another ... ready to rally the troops to political accept being radicalized people it's happening\n\nAnd you say well quite no one asked me to join the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war that are going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know if I say that they're going to see things like that no I'm not taking any side I Would say in general\nThis is what we're seeing itself composing there's no official word to be called\nThe wars within all of us were angry about everything we're radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything but doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\n\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identified the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identified after the war and that is what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just\nTerrifying all fronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as we risk missing the signs of network violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateur towards all the guards plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have MS Thirteen we are I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on these funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics can you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments another fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions products like mushrooms taking different forest but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nWe're seeing chaos accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds\nOh this needs to be taking care of so that's how it goes there are good officers out there to really fix having three thirty seven hundred in Tripoli except for three thirty seven hundred will be\nBack

thirty seven hundred\nCivilians except for three three ... if you don't want to get in and and that's the thing I don't understand this weekend there was a protest in my neighborhood downtown\nAnd ah anti fall was there and they were directing traffic and people were telling people were to go there are blocking traffic tell me more to go and if they wouldn't they were abusing them and the boys just sat there and let it happen\nYou know I Want to know why I Wonder I Wonder why you know people I mean if you look at some of the videos I had them on my Facebook page and I said to myself why does this happen in my community why is this happening in my town\n\nAnd I said you know be prepared for anything I wasn't prepared to see I mean for the first time in my life I was angry about what I was seeing because I saw this old man probably scared out of his wits\nBeing abused being yelled at having a baton bashing his car I mean it it's not just the mobs it's not just the anti fights it's everybody everybody's pissed off everybody's radicalized that up something stop being so damn radicalized\n\nThat radicalized we might as well call it's a civil war in this country and and it's not because we have a union and the confederacy we have several groups that are pissed off but want to be heard to want to be known and will do anything in their power to do it\n\nGo to Jack in California hijacker on ground zero yeah so right now we're in a unconventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's an unconventional all it's a civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times\nIt's not about dying it's about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die\nAnd some people have died because we've had these terrorist attacks we've had shootings we had all these things going on\nAnd no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what do you expect that show if you compare it to our first civil civil war was the first civil war this is Don unconventional what you want a Confederate union you're not you don't get a get it it can conventional just the way civil wars are fought in the twenty first century\nWell I think a President Trump acknowledged it when he referred to the angry mobs and\nOh well that's another thing you know civil war President Trump has no power let's he wants to enforce a sedition what'd you haven't done so I mean he has in civil wars there are no power the president will now be park is we want to do what they want anyway and the argument with their\nClient at the doors that looked like a scene out of the walking dead is exactly right\nBut you know what's interesting is some of the tactics that are being used like a giving out the first cell phone numbers of people in the address is yeah and confronting people at their whole set restaurants in the halls of Congress\nRight and this is this is ... this is conversion theory because what it does is it can ... people over to be the same way it starts the domino effect if one person decides to harass another person or another person or another but it all happens it happens it happens\nI mean you know a manned Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taken in and she should've been talk to but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know but anybody who sit there and encourages this type of a yes\nThey've been encouraging this type yeah ...\nYou know immediately to the media doesn't to encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past oh remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated mhm and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right
