see this call I said it's OK she said well\nI'll bring it over and she set it on the table and the people I was with with the kind that see things and everything and they were saying you see that the alien oh you see that ship you see this and I'm going uh-huh\n[laughter] and if you know we really well when I don't agree [laughter] property brought up and I always say bless your heart [laughter]

them\nThey'll leave me alone because I don't see anything in this thing and I but\nYou know just so the next thing I knew I so so I sleep 'cause I had this noise snoring\nOh have you know how do I get out of this so slowly opened my eyes and they were saying that was wonderful that was terrific and I guess it was [noise] and they did you hear that said uh he was an eight\nWeek still on a tape recorder and I said\nWhat did that come from and thinking I was definitely asleep and they said that she said no that's not me not even my voice and they said no it's definitely you and\nWhat has happened as I thought I had fallen asleep I'm so much of this information to pull it out through a couple of tapes without stopping and um I was totally\nFreaked out actually\nWas you were showing you were showing a yes or no let's go\nTo a that kind of situation I'm used to being sort of in control of the well semi and control are giving my permission and allowing a none of that has happened it was just boom and um\nThat that was my first introduction and a semi seemed very happy because it started to give its history and I was not happy\nAnd so okay it's goodbye and we won't do that again right that again\nYou know what I I remember I was at ... once when I went through a trembling session and it scared me so much the way through a wave of tapes of the recording I look back and regret that now because I remember was so amazing you know some of the things that are my boys are the my body did they have on tape and I'm just terrified me to the point where I didn't want\nWant anybody to see it nor do I want to experience that again but now looking back I'm thinking if I matured understand what this is an hour an hour to operate\nI long back to the time when that happened to me and uh would which would have kept a recording of but maybe somewhere out there somebody's gonna recording of recording some of my old shows but it was something definitely the traveling aspects are are are really amazing what can be done through the human body for human voice\nYes absolutely so that that was my first initial I'm meeting with the skull and um then they asked me to go back\nLike two months later I said no no no no\nNo but and then sent me had started calling me would struck up a friendship and and she was saying oh if I wanted to see you Dale and to to come up when I when Sammy cold you jumped [laughter] I\nDid go back a second time and I said okay I Know what you're about so I didn't look at it I I kept my eyes off it and everything and [noise] and Sammy\nSaid well let's see what this guy has to say it today\nPuts it in front of me and I'm not looking I don't get involved and um\nThe people that had come what kind of expecting something and I said look I'm Sorry but I Can't I don't know how to do you know\nThey won't be anything showing on command and starting to do well even though I may ask you to do it later so be ready\nTo accept that I put my hand on this go that's the last thing I remember [laughter] on my bike\nAnd so I said semi I you know I Can't do this and I can't do this anymore is it\nThis is a tricky for me and a look at all these things you said\nAnyway it went on for many many years and I they are being me I I like to prove it and I don't know if I told you about the storms so they had this panel\nOf experts come there was a physicist scientist a medical doctor and somebody else and they what we all out and touch me to a machine and things and um\nTo see what happened you know basically it was fraud if it was fraud and but I think anyway they they during the session\nThey said the instrument you're working with\nUm you told us that this could be used to control the weather so we'd like to see that demonstration\nAnd it said oh my okay storm so within minutes a storm blew up the really bad stone and then it said stop storm went away\nSo when I came back they told me I thought oh that's good that's that's some kind of proof the next time we were up there said well that could be coincidence have them do it again\nSo they asked for them you know to coach showed a storm again or do something and it said the yes control the weather right\nAnd that led to put my hand up didn't even say anything it started to rain really hot and we had some thunder and lightning and a pretty significant that they thought took notes and everything will record it and uh and the scarlet\nHad enough of it it said stop and it did within you know unusual amount of time minutes or the third time [laughter] it cuts Carroll said yeah that could be coincident too you know this guy\nThat I mean and that's one of the reasons why I Love you so much is because you know well you know you talk about you know these experiences you also weigh in coincidence you where you and the practical major up at all and you're very or you have a critical analysis\nEven of your own work which I think is amazing Terrell Davis were to pick a break and then like I said I'm afraid if we can\nDo to communicate with the scope and maybe in parts some wisdom to was from the school on the program tonight so it'd be nice to hear that from you so stay tuned
