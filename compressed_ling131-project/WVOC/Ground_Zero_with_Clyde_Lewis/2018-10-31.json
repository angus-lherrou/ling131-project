possible solutions to the situation on the southern border\nUh I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump though that's my sense of a thank you so much right in my front made dean rides I but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know he was getting I just I didn't want to step on the man's thought process seas so I moved\nTo the next roll call Maria\nRight does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting\nThey usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative while Maria they are already out spending a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a in full throated a fashion as they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough\nTo know the right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote\nAnd so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think you are honestly not seeing more shrill ah anti gun commentary in the media and while you're not seeing more people running\nAround protesting and all that kind of stuff ... right I'm a proud member of team buck Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere feeling the love well into the love Israel so I'm Glad you're\nFeeling it thank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please spread the word to your Israeli brothers and sisters that we\nWould love to have more and more of them listening in on the podcast joining in on the freedom hot a\nAries my buddy Roger bought this weekend the leftist media including fake tapper have proven their either agenda driven subversive bent on tearing the country apart for their own purposes or completely stupid and insane\nThere is no simple misunderstanding of difference of opinion on this point by calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic they're literally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups like the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country\nEt cetera et cetera uh yeah the media has been horrific on this aries and a top or has\nEmbarrassed himself insofar as he spent so much time creating this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias early age and he's a nasty snide little fellow and does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption\nBut I can tell you that are behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy and that's all you really need to know\nA and has made a joke of his whole show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can't say that on here so that's all you really need to know about some of these folks John\n... book I've been following all the quote justified violence from the left I Know how to beat it ah the anti ... and be all end folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just won't Republicans to fight back to defend themselves\nSo the left can point the finger at the right and say see they're they're violent fascist they're willing to be bloody didn't beaten up for it the real way to beat this has to follow the money\nWhy can't people with the right skill sets infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money ah John falling the money is very important that's why we had our friend\nRocking cut some on yesterday to talk about who is trying to fund these are the fund the caravan organizes the caravan\nThere are definitely people working out of things are definitely people that are putting money into this just a question of finding out who they are so I got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it\nWilly right seems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member\nCalled James Holmes after the Colorado shooting yes Willie I remember that there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was a remarkably not just non violent but peaceful and entirely law abiding\nMovement and I think that that doesn't get talked about enough for obvious reasons media doesn't want to discuss\nHow well behaved and how civic or how much civic responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement um shoes and rides you're so right on the TST I've got the real thing and I'll trade might be GST in for election laws trauma any day\nBecause it's not really a but not really because we did use your mind protecting itself it's coping skills Susan I'm yes Jews and the fact that liberals are running around saying that they think they have the DSD because Trump won the election tells you a lot about the fact that they do need a safe spaces\nEvolved a nice uh writes vote Shay as stop\nPot or ... or\nAh I Do not speak Espanol ... so I have no idea I assume it means something to converse\nVote Jay ... is this worry we converse I guess the answer's yes but I Do not speak Espanol so pleased right back a an ... an English or anything glass I Do not even I say that uh let's see\nJoanne rights would you address the issue of unvaccinated individuals' coming to the U.S in entering school systems all over the country\nWell Joanne this is a concern a real one but people get very tense about it because whenever you talk about migrants and disease\nThey say that that's inherently racist you're saying migrants are dirty and unclean and all this that's not what anyone should say or or is saying who is reasonable on this issue but there are concerns about vaccination\nA lack of vaccination of some of these Margaret populations\nAnd there have been diseases that have been propping up popping up across the country\nThat were thought to have been eradicated not in large numbers but it is something to think about and they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of immigration activists on the left who don't care\nAnd think that this is either ally which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans and also just want to shut the whole thing down even if it is in July because I think it's more important to we're closet open borders\nArchie and that's the show today please please spread the word tell somebody listen to the ... show\nYou can always listen on the on apple pie gas on the ...
