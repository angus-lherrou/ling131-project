women in my life who have the men in their lives around them and I've said this to miss Molly before she she's never safer than when she's around me because\nI Would risk my life to protect her nuts and I think that as my obligation as a man that is somebody who cries to uphold some standards of of honor for himself\nOr I Would you know if there were a threat to our physical safety I Would act in whatever way that I could whatever the costs may be so I you know I think that often gets less out of a left out of the discussion\nAnd a lot of I Know the guys listening to this program I now know exactly what I'm Talking about that the women in your life not just your wife or your girlfriend or\nBut you know the women in your life mom's friends colleagues sisters are are never as safe as when they are in your vicinity because your honor as a man is at stake the moment that any of them are under threat\nSo I just you know just trying to give the full context to this trying to make sure that we approached this discussion from all sides page writes I now have a Fifteen year old daughter named Reagan Cheney listening to your podcast as well\nShe's sharing with their friends and they started a young Americans for freedom club at their school page thank you so much for Israel Reagan Cheney is an awesome name and my name is ... so I Know something about awesome names\nOr at least weird names depends on who you ask\nBut that's very very cool about your daughter and I really want to get as many of the young conservatives across the country tuning into this program and and the way we're going to do it as by telling people to listen to the the pod cast\nOf the show a so there you have it Ronnie writes ah who shot the big book\nThree friends okay this is a joke Ronnie I'll have to read this one on my own time I was like wait someone no one shot buck buck is fine he's right here Peter I have a book that quote whoever told you your goal in life was to be happy is from ... eight and a half\nWhen a widow Marcello ... any uh talks to the cardinal if you like foreign art films is absolutely brilliant it's one of those where you watch it again and again figure out the layers and symbolism actual literal translation as who told you would come into the world to be happy\nOr I knew it was from somebody smart I a very ... writer friend of mine is one who said it to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy\nThe answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more commercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around us now because we live lives of what would have been inconceivable comfort ... even\nA hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole\nAnd happiness is not just about pleasure that's really where the that's really where the the break down I think comes in the in the way that we all exist today\nA Caroline right table and he said something yesterday that that I've been thinking about for years\nThe regional after so furious and on a hinge and so rabbit in their ... stations is because deep down they know they don't have logical on their side\nEvery one of their ideas when enacted results and failure they simply don't have a good historic track record so with logic and facts out the window they react emotionally I think Shakespeare put it best they'd dust protest too much\nShield childcare on the first of all props for getting the Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that and on to why the less get so upset yes I I think that the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons\nFor their outrage right the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons that they are so unreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view what people tell me I'm really wrong on something that I Know I'm right I don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least have that as a as a response\nBill of rights Tom Nichols announced his departure from the GOP in the Atlantic on MORNING Joe usually Morning Joe or rejoice at this I look forward to listen to your opinion

well intentioned individual when it comes to this country and I just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I don't engage\nWith him any more publicly because\nI I don't think that he's fair minded about what he said recently on Twitter so I'm not betraying any confidence here but he said\nThat what the Democrats did the Kavanaugh was bad but Kavanaugh's response was worse that's just garbage I mean that's just not a defensible position that because he was snappy with them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it\nIntellectually serious position and so for somebody who takes the position\nIn general as Tom does um that there's a lack of intellectual rigor among\nThe Trump supporters I look I think that ah I think he's gone down the wrong path on this one he's not the only one who used to be a conservative\nAt least he's honest though I you know give him some credit for this he says he's a Democrat and because he is he's a Democrat he so disgusted with the right that he is now playing for team left but I'm more okay with that than people who say oh I'm Still you know pull the Jennifer Rubin the
