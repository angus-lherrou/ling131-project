position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe\nTo supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap or early you know you're you're actually much more\nSolution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that we don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum\nThat's what they will do right so it's not this isn't oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum defensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song can you will still get process for the illegal entry\nBut that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these psi leaves properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against them they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but already or you're at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a a a set up at the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles\nThe eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and\nYou know you get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what a what you can do so or when you're you're on the right track my friend\nBryan writes box still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal
