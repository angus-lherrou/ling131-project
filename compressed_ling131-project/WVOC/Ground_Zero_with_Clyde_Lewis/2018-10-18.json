E. X. T A N T a sex\nTown as in my last name is the lay person who takes care of a a church\nAnd also can be the one who ... graves and collect money during off it tore a so they have it do you see that John I'm a grave digger yo yo\nIsn't that the name of the isn't it really is that it wait there was a law that was a wrestler right no it was a monster truck oh ... ... that's what I meant monster truck I knew that I knew that\nAnd I've been looking for the uh the drop to [laughter] whenever you tell the story I just want to play the drop but I Can't find it somewhere online for sure\nYep well there were there we go so uh that that is that is where Sexton comes from Don is next up your\nBook great show great hair shields high with regard to Leslie stall on sixty minutes while discussing the family separation at the border isn't it interesting that she said the law was on the books drawing Obama but he didn't enforce it\nIsn't that an admission of guilt hey no numbers this time I'm well John I Would say that it's not an admission of guilt but yes it's been a mission that it was Obama administration policy to ignore parts of the law that Obama did not like\nI'm so yes that that is a thing that the Obama administration would do and it leads to lawlessness unless it is for very specific reason and it's a it's John Ford true\nA resource and prosecutorial discretion justifications if it's just 'cause I don't like this thing so I'm not going to enforce this thing well that's not the way it's supposed to work\nBob\nWrites Google Play seems to be behind on posting your podcast thought you'd like to know I don't know John it that happened were were behind the puck I suppose this week\nThat seems strange to me when you get that out sooner\n... writes buck thanks again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve a political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in our upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of lies and who perhaps has been involved in questionable a pub a publicity schemes the other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either but for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very\nVery a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for writing in\nUm [noise] well you know since I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations is is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue a bit I I think that uh\nPrinciples are most important for you and your day to day life but principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of mix look what happened with justice Cavanaugh I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now\nThat varies I mean there's there's people that are shady\nAnd there's people who are who are grotesque\nAnd and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take\nA trustworthy on policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a\nUpstanding but legislatively on palatable Democrat\nI suspect Robin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of Langston which they distort truth to make their agenda seem plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can't see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look it rhymes\nI didn't Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there is no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much for writing and yeah I Do think that there's a a mass hysteria and really a mess psychosis those overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks in short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here are some phone nicknames\nA liar walk the fraud resume a fake a Jew we are I guess instead of ... we're out of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael well Michael you are certainly a creative fellow appreciate you writing in sat\nNext up here he says I have no idea why no one has had the possible murder and Turkey's Islamic problem with my three combat tours in the middle east as an infantryman I never saw stories of babies around an ovens dead families to include journalists make them shut up please\nOh I was on the ... is turkey is as long as problems ... um yeah you know ... you're you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia\nAnd this whole uh this whole murder\nAnd that's not by accident the left is very quick to criticize religion that has not Islam but it's very fond of defending Islam at every\nTurn even even radical and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nWhich is really where the problem was so there you go I'm Jen writes the where do you hear the news talk about the reporter at first I thought it was one of ours\nThis is not our issue not our citizens not our our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue with Trump hadn't just succeeded in getting our pastor back half of draw attention away from that to something we have no control over I really do just like the media to make my head hurt well Gen I agree with you\nThanks everybody for writing in on that one I appreciate hearing from you as always big that\nShow tomorrow and every
