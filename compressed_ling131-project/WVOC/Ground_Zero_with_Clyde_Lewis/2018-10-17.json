really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then\nBut uh they made up and they created the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny on called re from Madison talked about all stop\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana ... didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with nations war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever say but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around are around people are a surround people who simply want to get high whether it's
