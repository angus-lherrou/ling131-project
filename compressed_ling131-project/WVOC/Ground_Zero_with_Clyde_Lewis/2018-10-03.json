when asked about his drinking behavior in school he spoke indignant about going to church getting good grades and volunteering at soup kitchens\nI unfortunately haven't well school this communication style by nurses just acts the behavior of all these types of participants was appalling but unfortunately rather familiar\nUm and a bunch of privilege prep school kids with way too much money and freedom and no supervision I saw some of that when I was in school and is anyone remember Animal House that movie made its mark because it was real this was not a fantasy about space aliens\nUm those yearbook entries tell the tale beach week Ralph club a hundred and ... run off the alumnus and the most telling devil's triangle which basically describes would miss sports does happen with the two boys\nHe dismissed them all with Lindsay explanations that would never succeed during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows use a two or three people are like I got I got to tell you\nI'm I I just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly contextualize ing how a person like Kavanaugh would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school\nIt doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in a in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual\nDid cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and she's only certain that Kavanaugh's the bad guy\nI find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events scores with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way\nTrying to shut you down or shout you down I I just happen to tell you I I strongly disagree with your entire premise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all this\nMax right hey buck\nA with a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background when we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn when she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six\nYears ago max let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe it for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously\nThere's a reason that sexual abuse in many different you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I say there are pockets listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason and being a Larry's at the same time quick question maybe you can help me with this in terms of the lie detector test what I've seen release was documentation of Mitch for being asked two questions by the administrator\nIn regards to the statement she wrote but she testified June invasive an arduous process that was longer than she expected\nShe told her whole life story being asked a lot of questions and crying a lot which is it as a person who has had to observe lie detector tests being administered I've never seen a ... question test they are similar to her description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle as possible know Jennifer I don't think you missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeems suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in the way that they have been trying to hold this off as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's a I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason\nAnd I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here\nIs all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take that polygraph no one's ever given me a satisfactory ... answer\nThat question no one Raymond ... unrelated to

that was a the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable to what you

Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people\nLost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case with Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the dust cloud nine eleven

previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an eerie quality to it in\n... you know you want if you want to get technical when was the brown broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what was that September eleventh All right yeah\nI'm saying just one thing but I was calling about the rice and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to them Adderall in Venezuela where they accused

because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down to that is going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel do if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping

not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell
