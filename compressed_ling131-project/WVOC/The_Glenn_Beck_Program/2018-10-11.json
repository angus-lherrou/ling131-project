traditional or devoted conservatives twenty five percent\nWow wow that's really low\n\nWill only eight percent of Americans are progressive activists\nExcuse me\nTheir views are even more out of the mainstream and are less typical\nTwo thirds of Americans do not belong in either extreme ah ... extreme progressive as liberal as progressive activists or as traditional devoted conservatives\nThe vast majority is now considered something called the exhausted majority\nThe members of this two thirds of our society share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints and uh have a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority this like political correctness\nAmong the general

partially affirmed is that African Americans are most likely to support political correctness but the difference between them and other groups is much smaller than generally supposed\nThree quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness three quarters\nThis means there are only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average

issues on social media it's not just about politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump that can be about repealing the national anthem that can be about something that a celebrity status and an amplified in sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that\nCategory too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly malicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or stock puppet accounts\nYou were talking about a moving target people who are deleting their accounts changing their information making new accounts staying active so that they can't actually be attracted to it and given location and if Morton ... researcher at us it could prove definitively that these are Russian agents that he should be working at the CIA\nBut he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors do they engage in debate speak in all caps what words do they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look them up again these are sort of thing that you look for when you're talking about foreign influence\nOn line and it might be Russian that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some clarity and with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they landed that went to the plant into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen account that could specifically be

that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the thought in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know

applied to\nSociety and we're starting to understand society as and they'd be constructed in systems of power and knowledge is a construct of the power that it comes from language the language\nIs dangerous because it constructs that reality that and that sort of the key ideas which are underlying that the problem that with that way saying now\nNow you say that it doesn't have a ... that it's not ... worrisome in arts but I Would consider literature art as well\nAnd this is this is now how we are being taught that we have to read literature that uh we read it through the lens of oppression white male European oppression\nUm even if the even if the author is saying no no that's not what the story is about but not the author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modernist they can take and read that tax any way they want direct\nAbsolutely yes I mean I think that they like contagion because that that probably ... to ... it out if the cultural philosophical problem but\nI ... and look for example would be a very different saying it would be something that had made clear thought that it has an unending ... which is just the beginning of lots of stories which doesn't add up that said that is a style that is oh\nOkay completely separate from ... moralistic thing\nAll right so you're saying as an artist you could create something that has no meaning a but it is only when it's used as a critique that it starts to get into trouble you know coming\nIn and says some wonderful and then they found and you say the ... than not political said than not the same

are behind it\nUm so let me let me first say post modernism the modern world is the world that was created that chased out the dark ages it was the it to the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason them period the empirical evidence\nUh and and even I mean the ... when you hear people say mathematics is racist this is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that whole foods the modern world together is that correct\nYes they they think that it has been constructed I'm saying is that a lot of voices has been left out and this relates somehow toilet technology

not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all down they got to take all the system's down they're not going to win through culture\nUm and then it was but it was actually

been really good for Republicans in the Senate or it's looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls as one poll that had them tied at one point um ah ah several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see ... well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you go after them right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I have one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is very tend to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is it's part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that poll bound up up a nine points\nIn that one and he seemed to be honest with our eyes are open up a lead there

fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices\nRight now so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did well\nGood question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise and bonds are more attractive relatively than stocks\nI'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we don't see real signs of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the fed and and a ... journal Jerome Powell lying you're taking a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to the squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation revenue believe we should watch your guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we have international trade we have um [noise]\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't necessary I Am a little concerned by the way I'd go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon sooner you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\n[noise] you know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf acts up online bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick\nOn the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next year or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife honey let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me let me ask you this I don't know if\nThis is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't he speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... Glen you and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made\nSo many mistakes so you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up\nThis bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and eight I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China I I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is\nKnow great but do you think is it Stephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that tariffs are good\nHere's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy\nBut I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here or he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be sealed candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheated\nOr stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like\nYou know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction uh when it comes to China they let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about that like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going\nTo play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time if I knew basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your a trade secret ...

his is illegal\nThen so is James Smith so it just kinda cancels each other out\nI'm saying that if there's two penalties on the play it's significant because then they're both corrupt politicians I

that I'm sure we start there or do you go to start with the some of the hurricane stuff\nUh well I don't know if I Want to talk to somebody who cannot agree with NBC News that are not natural disasters these are man made disasters\nNow so it wasn't manmade that we want an entire decade basically without getting one hurricane hitting the let me ask you something about that sir yeah uh\nYou would you agree with me that over the last ten years in the last ten years mhm we have seen a dramatic increase in hurricanes here in the United states since we dropped out of the Paris accords yes\nSir no sir is a yes or no answer and you were you saying has it gone from zero to two and the time that\nI mean since he's been out of that uh it had an increase Sadler I mean the trend is not increasing that we we have one year that had more than another year is that what you're trying because I I I'm asking you in the last ten years and have we seen a cup of\nThese ... these so called natural disasters I Want to just in the last couple of years thank you for your question NBC\nI mean there has been an increase from all over the years of age you very much [laughter] that journalism these days it is here's what the PCC\nSays remember this is Al Gore's a favorite place to go for ... permission and this is what they say about hurricanes numerous studies toward the end beyond the fifth assessment report of the Irish or a PC have reported a di\nDi di di di\nGreasing trend in the global number of ... of tropical cyclones\nAnd or the global globally accumulated psychotic energy there's low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cycle numbers under global warming over the past four decades\nThere's consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting

hurricanes going down\nAnd there is low confidence in any change in the I'm In ... like what they say it's like well because they used to say there's going to be more frequent and intense hurricanes\nThan they realize the frequency thing wasn't happening there it's got to be more intense they don't even have evidence of that and so\nThat was me Mr ... here is this not the strongest storm\nA it on record the vet is hit the Florida Panhandle that is the reporting you sir I rest now here's the summary\n[laughter] ah the PCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes and tornadoes have increased much less increased due to a greenhouse gases that exactly the story you're getting on the media when they're trying to say we have ten years so we have renewed this they've they've\nThey've up to their commitment and in response\nI tell them up yours [laughter] so [laughter] ah [laughter] it is a pretty remarkable okay let me let me
