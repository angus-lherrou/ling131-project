C I F ... well we're just seeing reports that Megan Kelly will not be on her show the airing a repeat this morning\nReports yesterday said she broke up with our agents that NBC is at the least considering a change at the most trying to get out of that sixty nine million dollar contract with her\nNot a surprise by we choose to make it a great day we'll see in the morning by\nBroadcasting from the studios W ... or ... radio station\nAnywhere you go on the\nPackages number eight and nine nine Dave Anthony Fox News found this morning police in Delaware just intercepted one male the former vice president Biden looking very similar to all the other ones that the Democrats another turned up at five AM in New York City\nIt's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says get are done except none of your bombs get it done\nNone they they've had zero chance of making it through security screening\nAnd Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go pissed dam road runner keeps go getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see of or Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening\nThese devices were not designed to kill but to be detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one\nNow I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left I don't know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms\nNo one knows yet this could be a kid that just thought this would be funny\nAgain there's no chance these bombs would go off\nSo maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up she just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however\nIs not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know at this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nOr you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business and Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms is\nIs over or that complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would\nForce one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep in your memory\nBank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent to the white\nHouse James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happened\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen he barely remember was I walking at that time\nI don't even know and as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on any saying\nEverything is speculation and if I Would say All right I think there's there was a left wing person trying to Iran for everybody up what would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny called credibility but you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\nWell\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous\nIs this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it when I when we first looked at I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and a pipe bomb and explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need [laughter]\n[laughter] right um but there's another ingredient they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm they said they did detect some of that and there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing a\nLower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these uh these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and\nSerious the situation but there was a level of sophistication levels with suspicion because\nHe had sent her or she by the way he or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices and and\nResidences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional\nUh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from the get the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they didn't have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or stores service at

I guess I've seen\nPictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and sugar ...\nAnd less and less again potentially a you thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing me\nYeah right like what's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nThey put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you want metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass even more ... you you don't want it in PVC pipe you want it in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just ... it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be some\nYou know mentally deficient\nA right winger that did it it also may be somebody who\nWas on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative could be that two of quaint don't know I mean you have\nTo have some level of skepticism of the south of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figuring look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievably someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point what you see these statement that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think a virus that might have been [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there is it obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them are stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off it's certainly possible but\nThey are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some

it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong that\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer instead what we got was an apology\nI Am so sorry I should know oh please don't be me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you\nKidding me how are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know we should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was ...\nIsn't this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak he's had to work to\nExercise himself in crimes stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television\nUh episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they they have a situation where they all wake up what after getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the animation but it's still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting Chinese say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good but the child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd the only thing standing mix right you want to be black yet right they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well and you would think the kids it's not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to adjust some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses their gig over that I mean\nIt's just completely insane and we are not adults if we can handle that level of

that a is there anything can be said for\nUh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not\nHe's not the rebel anymore it's that's just not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy

like Hitler on the left for about three years he's\nHe's like he's the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talk about what are Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no cosponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that policy and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where we\nLook at Canada and say that to socialize nation that was not\nThat's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\nReally\nHas been a leader of that parade for a while but now he's kind of ... in back of that is it's ... it's kind of gotten a hands on the closest movie um capitalism a love story with uh the communist uh them but it used to be the Soviet Nashville handsome and and that kind of thing is just not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does it say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at that time was seemed like\nGehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish ice I should stay away from Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls\nAnd the Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it

is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that a Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had said the department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out an agreement with Mexico a whereby\nA or Mexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people are coming from with the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the EU refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words\nWhen people were fleeing a ... a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially safe here that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I saw that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not\nCome to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy and apply for asylum I I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nWe ... it should be more like that and that's not really how it works\nAnd that ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're sort of going for the long bomb\nHail Mary pass in trying to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey itself\nI'm ripe with opportunities for people to be exploited a ... it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually\nAssaulted during the ... and a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the\nAsylum application that they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as
