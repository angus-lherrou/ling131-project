yeah at least I'm I'm going through the right steps of the cutting of it a little pieces and put him in this case is and I think that's your clean up after yourself that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards you know\nIt's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter I uh ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was an Arab\nHe'd written it's relatively new yeah because he left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one was the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like they've got to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation um when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about\nLike one of our allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to\nThe FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a friendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them to ...\nI mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point no longer and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the\nMedia coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right we're never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and\nFive hundred years since ... what are the way it was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for uncle bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who was a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and I'm pretty much every other media source is\nThat this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nOr potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't there are more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning I don't know if anybody knows this but we're ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing it over and you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up a working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why he captures the interest but being patient and\nMaking sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy\nNilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nA cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nYou know look it's a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we think we see that happening too infrequently\nOver the past few decades and it and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are

plus years ago\nAnd yet uh I just saw an article today above from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice right from office yeah I'd just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corroboration and\nNo evidence yeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest hate Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court because they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block ... block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker do not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not I'm not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um any and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the\nPolice and and again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up it's totally different\n... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she wanted to have back what happened what mine of it it happened ... none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named instead\nCame out that yeah I remember that party I remember hearing ... really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident was just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who\nEven knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to take down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it she eventually told the FBI the truth uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nOnly because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people say ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so now while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about\nThe rape immediately after it occurred or a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room Broderick explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked her rapist like by the way I'm going to renovate the color of their work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was\nA prison outside the hotel window wow that is ... times the amount of even alleged evidence that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and\nNow yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total ... to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on is still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt's it's the situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nActual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo courts it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard that's in sanity it's insanity and yet you have\nClinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there was some ... can show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy\nAnd there was a war among the work\nBecause no one should dictate that singular message when I was a kid stuck with me\nMy whole life and I knew I became a libertarian it's why I went to law school and I I I argued the way I did it why when I teach um she wanted\nTo I it it it's singular message oh no and it's like hey\nThat is an every occasion

K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd part of this saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations\nOf him doing something that against them as well right like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure ing himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely the power to makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible how right in this country now mine credibility to tamper fired at any job in the nation any job you're a sarcasm is just reality in a situation like that they're kind of comical what they what they were saying they're saying that ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there or something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was\nWho is this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues and\nThat's the center the allegation maybe he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation ... learn to do this thing which is ... obviously ... right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of uh making eat well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think that\nThe one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing however the crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there is evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other one people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar comedy cellar as famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose hey well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on the stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen all the people were just upset\nThat he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever might never it's never\nToo well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as you harvest place what you would say\nUm and so you could make the case as the left has beat forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be we their programs to give felons and convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused ... yeah it really doesn't make any sense AAA seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse ing currently

around and we're like well I think he ... he ... did blackout how healthy you know not only he would know that right ah you know and maybe he did I I\nDon't see how that's all that ah\nThere's no way to know that and to the conversation but still there's no way to know what it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this is the subtle accusation that everyone who supported\nBrett Kavanaugh was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people in the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believed uh you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is\nThey accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the Supreme Court\nRight and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and they haven't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe but even that is so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWater we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike for the party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in ... motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that vis a vis a vis a Kurd\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man if they've salt didn't happened they didn't survive it and [laughter] yeah I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah look I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nNot whether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk about\nUh yeah I Know we talk about the the women's right to choose it is to fend did as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they ... they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that\nRight that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are off older women are off all men are awful they do terrible things\nThat you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they can do we know for a fact\nThe fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on\nTheir letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened\nWe know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store and the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two and in the second one is the is that there's ... there\nRight when they the person who made the allegation said I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media did locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember to even happen exactly\nIs the old act on Sunday ... operating evidence on that one either and there was and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was it an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In it of course obviously people a cabin on his uh his uh what is the worst thing though um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing it relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was\nOh it was if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you could do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like in the media access if it's an entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nDon't of course that could happen and I think like Lee did at least in four or five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you you brought up to high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him say credits didn't like him to really encourage\nInstead they found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the peace and they realize it was an air south yeah they knew what was in ... they said it was an air soft gun and they're they're still being congratulated for their swift extent [laughter]\nAnd you know that I don't know I don't know what are you going to do with an air ...
