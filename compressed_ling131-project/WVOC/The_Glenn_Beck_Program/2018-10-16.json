nowadays [noise]\nIn October nicotine\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to now ... we need to make that a oatmeal soup that she made in ... found don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because\nThis is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was\nFor Native American yeah super duper NATO really was a she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee and then they revise that you won the ... the media revised that can they actually\nThat's what the report it says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and then they realized loops deep sea we made a a map there this is a serious correction been in the deep sea and the corruption but they pay they should have a cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between\nOne uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course and in of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them\nOne of those pieces would have a little bit of\nCherokee now this theoretically right I could at least give her a\nTechnical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her was stupid super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nPower and I'm not sure how how come out and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow\nThat's where I'm going all fall I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to I just\nThought let's all complain about the names of out ball teams ... how ... from here on out our our audience what's called our tribe and we mean it in the Native American sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they didn't show\nAny DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia\nColombia yes well way and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nOr and even that it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years\nHe would not show the his Canadian blood sites like that's not the only to the old well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian with DNA does is it shows that lineage again shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that\nHe's a thousand times more Hispanic than a hundred friends disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that\nA ... so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing and second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nUm it was her great great great great\nGrandmother I think a several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the born a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of a Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from aggressive we have learned that if you identify as something you are that thing\nThis woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was really were not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to\nAccept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying and let me just like\nLook I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth\nWarren's face more than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them ah I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather\nActually took a horse or be a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet and he told him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and\nHe took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so ... ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I gotta go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly it might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this is what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages\nThrough your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls when I was ... I almost made it into WWE but\nHow many times have you told a story you been on the air for how many years never never I've never lose you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why I decided I can give you that I got what it's about is I give you then you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we\nWill you know what is a huge part of this story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage\nSuch as return ally or to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation using a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and\nWrong it makes a\nMockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of ...\nOkay look not a good look yeah they're they're not uh they're not offering the piece by peer to her\nOr she should probably zip it and it does does not go on this whole saga of the last two days with the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning signs to Democrats\nSo and she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean advise cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nIf you're\nYou've been eaten you've been eaten by the hard left and the Democrats are waking up to it they don't like what's happening on campuses they don't like what's happening in the news they may not like what's happening in the White House either but they're not about shouting their abortion\nColombia's home for Rush Limbaugh news radio vibes sixty ...\nFrom the W. view their own very for was probably the most recent wrenching rain we've seen a group of experts said to come together to figure out how to reduce the impact of\nFlooding in South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster yesterday announced the creation of the south Carolina floodwater commission called for a panel to study and propose solutions to mitigate flooding meanwhile President Trump pledges the federal government will do everything it can to help hurricane Michael recovery efforts\nYou tour disaster areas of the Florida Panhandle in Georgia yesterday\nWhich we aren't doing more\nThan anybody would have ever done\nSo far Nineteen deaths have been confirmed and the investigation picks up today after two people were killed in a crash during a police chase in Lexington county that happened yesterday on three Twenty one year the state farmers market his troopers were pursuing a stolen car car crash into a van went off the road hit a guard rail flip the driver was rejected\nSwung the forty four year old Timothy Roberts died the seeing the passenger ideas Lexington thirty nine year old Nicole Baron died at the hospital drink or when he was radio five sixty W.

all over the country by the way\nSo this is a planned attack that anti for his work I think the and the and the people working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trash windows smashed ... pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA and then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos you're just we made signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out\nOr ... or organized rallies like there's this kind of met that you'll see if you really get deep into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys go over there over there a citizen journalists get beat up\nThey take his backpack their police to arrest him\nThen I waited ... they were arrested the citizen journalists\n... no no I'm Sorry they arrest three like that and who mob this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist or pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to ah Austin is a on their Facebook page has\nCalled for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what did they call it a black shirt army or something I read a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... must be the Mets had guy that police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about [noise] um so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther king guy Malcolm X Ray I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic\nSword I make a choice which the joke and that's when they are all the Internet may I jump in the car\nAnd then uh this group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter\nThey were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and now in your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then Malcolm X world it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no ... NO PLAN it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away than they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super left wing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens when somebody likes Trump's shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh\nThat's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes up five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days are subterfuge stays in the domestic violence it's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now I think they don't dislike antifa they are antifa\nI think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried to be more moderating or on my on my\nWords with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick them when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole\nA mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and they own their own conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing a white supremacist is someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\n[noise] okay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own a take you over across the breaking and just\nYou what it is you believe\nOr Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no L.

addicted outrage I I\nAs some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's not that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and um\nAnd they're getting more and more dangerous and I have talked\nTo you about Martin Luther king for a long time a a somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said\nA year about a year to to a head I'm not sure um\nMaybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe but it's not about it's\nNot about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in washing I'm not talking about political people have talked about your neighbors\nBut the first thing we have to do is unite with each other we have to unite to people people who are or on the right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together and I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the\nHey you're on the train or you're not on the train but he talking about what train where's the train going\nHere's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates\nThat's America that's great that's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer\nAcross the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time\nBut we do need a rule of law\nLet me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who you voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on just answer yes or no\nDo you hate men do you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops\nDo you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe screen to violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you but I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't a hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are those are the people you need we need to unite with with the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side getting the Guinness and I\nMay disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through ...\nSinging hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead and let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and not punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nDo you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nGreat that led to stand together and put our\nOur differences of approach aside because we got a lot of work to save this thing right now\n[noise]\nBy the way Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and voices don't start coming together uh [noise] more are going to be silenced what was it

and the fact is I Believe a yes or every country that has relations with Brazil's a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a ...\nGovernment so you don't know exactly what's coming\nHe he grew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has him to the in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for ... ... what a Ninety nine a civil war\nUm and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by ... so uh\nHe's closest advisors today are a military\nSo a a an exception is a ... just a that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is a liberal so we have several different says regarding President Trump as you mentioned he is he he's a liberal and he uh comes\nAs he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points out as a base of the trust in his government but uh he\nSaid he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding the press for example he has been using\nSocial media as his basic communication tool [noise]\nDon't ... this is the kind of ... ... tons of the same thing that you go job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the\nNationalizing everything is [noise] is there a ... ... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as a military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect to hear most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately\nHe will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has a suggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitution for Brazil and\nThat would be submitted a to a vote for ah after it so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so\nIt he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back\nOnce he takes office because the fact\nIs that he's not going to debate he uh is\nGiving I'm just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut a analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time ... including because uh in the legislative elections he\nGot a a strong a performance in eh from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of government\nMelody and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what would be those changes\nCome can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] a death wish I had both ... son it ...\nAnd he posted on line a while back a photo\nOf him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon as said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this ah this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a bull so not a strategy\nBut a boat for NATO himself a came to public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it would we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of this right wing movements that with the uh in other parts of the world\nIncluded a Donald Trump and is a movement so he understand that it and it's a clear wave in that\nDirection and ... it would be an expression of this but we had no a clear indication that he would be involved there is a picture of him close to the president's at presidential candidates Ken\nAnd some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAnd now at the end of the ... and ... on Sunday twenty eighth and\nWe'll have the final result it's very likely dead considering the current ... they'll sonata we'll be elected\nUh we uh yesterday we had at a recent poll that gave us an adult fifty nine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from their workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and and both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to ferry sure of their votes so and we we would have to have a new fact ... thing that would it be strong enough to change the scenario Ben\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and find out uh some more we'll be following a thank you so much for pre shit okay\nThank you so much for having me you but\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and uh he\nIs not a Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's a change demand uh [noise] you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator\nYou know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobble together this um\nPopulist movement and populism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody\nWe have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike as severe spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are big\nIn Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector\nBecause they think if this goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where are they going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was a easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that's you know can hurt the industry you also have Saudi Arabia being\nThe massive check on um uh on Iran\nIf they are weakened if uh they are a weekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force in our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of\nPower yes and uh you know again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel doesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know is a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do they can stop the worst of the things that are as a ... year presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today I uh [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nAh resigned [laughter] I Know ah I I think um\nYou have to feed first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do um so I\nThink we're over there were the king of the king says she's screw up total screw up this guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe in these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we\nDid it ... I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then\nI remember there was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is\nThat uh they believe that he was um you know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "16"}
