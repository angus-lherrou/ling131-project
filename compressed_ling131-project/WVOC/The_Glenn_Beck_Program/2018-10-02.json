like\nWhat but what it does say what he does say is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his\nAnger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I mean anyone reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with our aim thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the

not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so

emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there is nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it\nYou're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn\nUnless your God you don't know that you cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a case to be made\n\nHere destroying a person's life see here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice\nShe's looking for ... to ...

was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those women had things about them that I don't like both of those men or they had been one was a\nAlleged land or the other was a clear racist gundy I still think they were great men there were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collective justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil\nBecause of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this\nTo their neighbors\nWhen you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war of people like her saying\nWe should feed their genitals to the pigs tell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric and what a surprise\nOnce again it's coming

the course\nOf two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press tried to convince everyone we were these evil monster is saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that but because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so what's the best way\nTo get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them\nIt's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because I'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\n\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these in the years you're flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way\nAnd as I have said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions\nBut what amazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who\nSay you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least make in some sense please do not rubbed their allow we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that\nWill come to them\nIf we're going to heal the nation the first thing we have to do is peel the right we're going to heal the nation\nWe have got to put our differences aside and begin to open up our

there's a ton a ton in there\nWell I I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's I think it's absolutely in line with the cat was like well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this capital thing yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump is not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing\nThe entire um the entire effort of logic off base it's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just to make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories of the book and just show exactly why every\nThe thing is happening point by point yeah uh you can find a book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting and why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the whole who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy and to collapse\nThe system that we have yeah and if you'd like you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in her life hooked us up something you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics\nYou can fight against it much more effectively and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about than fight just fight to the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way to dictate outrage we'll talk about

possible corruption and backroom deals and he doesn't like it and that's why he vetoed that moved in this part of this last one we talked about six months ago the decree to the universities to spend whatever they want without receipts yeah and then just to show either his ignorance or what he believes to be your ignorance House Ways and means chairman Bryon white Republican Anderson defended\nIt by saying these aren't even state tax dollars that we're talking about\nTheir other funds which are not tax dollars we've been hyper inflating the state budget over non taxpayer money\nIf we're going to fund the colleges let the colleges have the freedom to spend the money however they like when excuse me but aren't we the taxpayers already funding the university's needs yes that's the four point three billion dollars that tax dollars are using to keep all these state universities open like I've always said\nIf you don't want to have the restrictions of the state taxpayers overseeing you\nBecome a private university you never have to answer to us again it's so easy you think we see protested the streets taxpayers defending our right to continue to throw money at the university\n[laughter] what do you think let us know onto it at rice thought [noise]\n\nThat the than\nAbout any message here football parties will create red carpet in here that cleaning handle any

scientific community were caught off guard by the Soviet technological achievements and they're United effort to catch up with the Soviets Harold is the beginning of the space race\nThis week in Nineteen sixty five pope Paul Bissett arrives at Kennedy international airport in New York City the first visit\nBahrain post to the United states during his tax one day American visit limited entirely to New York city pope Paul visited St Patrick's cathedral met with President Lyndon Johnson at the Waldorf Astoria hotel addressed the general assembly of the United nations attended a public

warts and egg or came out on top and the lemon we campaign to replace Gray Davis who earlier had become the first United States governor to be recalled by the people since Nineteen Twenty one sport that was one of a hundred and thirty five candidates on the ballot\nWhich included career politicians other actors and one adult film star\nThat's your look back at this week in history [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nGlenda command\nAll right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Capitol which again\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned oh yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist oh\nThank you very important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like a judge\nOr or ah or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general would weigh like one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman a he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case in the case of the cabinet case happened uh thirty six years ago the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but I saw in different blood a\nProfessor Ford she had a spotty memory\nShe's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violent okay oh okay that really got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the forward case yeah it was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes that do to ... to actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you though using\nMeeting me yeah and so she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos of the incident and has photos of bruising ... or the other one of course does not um being for she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course\nI'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening then people forward named cannot\nSay that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of those that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she had named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also\nA named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures and are those are things that\nShe showed two co workers in real\nTime real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like who Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have video tape\n... tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these Walter occasional we ... we have not seen it yet\nOf course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word for is video with the with the veil and ... and\nWe don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of ... ... there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year":
