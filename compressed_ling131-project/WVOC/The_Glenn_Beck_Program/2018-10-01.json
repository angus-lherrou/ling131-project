... ... ...\n... here in Grand Rapids profound\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way Hallows do have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend she well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years\nShe's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security\nAs the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is\nOn old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any it's CNN's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should be the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line a she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nNot to the court not for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this\nUh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah I ... as a homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility with the left yes\nSo she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly\nWhat it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nYou're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty third team notes from a therapy session lists the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six but then something changed three weeks later in July third\nA letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late teens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've\nBeen saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it it gets\nBetter this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with her lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged attack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick at events of her life\nWhy is this significant well because if the attack happened when she was in her late teens or in the mid eighties\nFrom the w._b. oh

right we're talking about the\nCapital of thing and I I\nI Want to talk to those people who I think are reasonable who can look at Ford and see her testimony and say okay so why why why wouldn't we just do the FBI thing\nIn a reasonable world you're you're absolutely right\nIn a reasonable world you're right but this is not about Ford and this is not about making sure that these charges stick its why as soon as this happened as soon as Jeff Flake said no no wait a minute hang on\nWe want an FBI or investigation as soon as that happened the narrative changed now they're going after him saying he lied about drinking beer\n[laughter] okay he was for the love of Pete people\nSo this is how do you look at how the accusations that he wasn't by out drunk I Know how would you confirmed he was I Know I Know it's ridiculous I Know\nSo uh\nWe're getting to that later because I as an alcoholic I got a lot to say on that one [laughter] um but ah they've changed the narrative\nAnd they are playing the American people and here's an here's how it's working\nWhat they've done is they've turn this into something that is more than Kavanaugh look if Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the lack of evidence what they've done is they've not made this about Kavanaugh they've instead made this about victims\nEvidence play the elevator encounter with Jeff Flake\nOut my national and all you're going to be here and that you might

community be cheering this guy\nWell it's very easy once you're away from an emotionally and you actually look into it it's easy what was happening was African Americans were feeling that there was no

old at the time that this happened achievers frequenting parties with high school ...\nYears [laughter] I Know I Know is high school sophomore myself oh man all me and my buddies\nWe were the college checks were all over you know women women usually look for a young man you know especially those in high school that never happens that never happens\nEspecially Brett Kavanaugh who let's be clear the guy sounds like he was a complete torque when he was when he was in high school this is somebody who can\n... you can see on his calendar he literally has notes on his parents would ground him I mean this guy was a complete ... in high school I was like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off because it was great I'm really happy\nSo the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel in the suburbs of Maryland it's just asinine on his face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on\nA matter of faith based on historical pattern of injustices that notion and that's what's happening here late but they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things\nOr because you know women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism in there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat ... that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system you go back and use\nThe polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against a system that\nWas geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window\nOf opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so I understand how talking points are circulated\nAnd how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that they're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like waiting at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh had lost his footing ah with with reason um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says\nYou know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper red meat ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you evaluate a case it based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOr other people that are just as qualified why don't we just go sky why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the commit this right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion and in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore right the the guys calendar clear is that right the testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also fears him\nSo you you have to cast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nTheirs is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because what you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back us up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times\nSo I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new glow of that guy that guy that that guy\nFriend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell you've got to have to fight the yeah yeah but but we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I'd never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met met right we're just going off of your city right now and based off is they'll memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy so look like it's family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with political your ideologically\nAt the same that's what they do and and and banana republic than a third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Gemini when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second general do you have to I'm I actually have to run the meeting well okay All right well run too I mean we'll talk we'll talk some other time it gives them a [noise]\nI really want to I really want to hear from people who are in that\nCan respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um\nUm we just have to stop all of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right you know we\nNeed to up their dinners you know as I said earlier one one prominent Democrats said we should um ... what stops us from disturbing people where they sleep\nDomestic issues are people that have weighed two\nAnd three on editing news radio five sixty W.

now scheduled with him but I'm hoping that he has more time because I think you're going to be fascinated by his story and I want to start\nAt the beginning with him let's go to Larry shore bell hello Larry how are you\nEh Glenn how you doing good morning\nThe morning or so I wanted to talk to you I'm really from the beginning if you have time to tell me the story of your life because you were you've had kind of a rough childhood\nYour your dad was black your well your mom was white and they weren't married he was in the sixties\nThat's not a popular thing moms moms family she was afraid wouldn't ... you is that how it started that's true okay tell me the story from there\nSure um I was born in Manhattan I'm as you as you said biracial parents and my my biological mom didn't take the family would accept me so she put me up for adoption\nSo uh my bicycle father was not in my life so I don't know um what he was thinking about that he wasn't in my life so I was very lucky and I was adopted by a biracial couple um my mother was ah my mom who was my brother um was German and met my father\nWho was black and the army in Germany they brought me to the south Bronx\nAnd that's where I was raised by Yankee Stadium and you might know in the seventies and sixties when I was this was not the best neighborhood um so that's where I was raised a my father was a corrections officer at Rikers um the jail here in New York City and my mother was a waitress and then worked in a bank\nShe and I left and we all we left together we we rate got enough money so we actually are packed up it was out to Long Island when I was around eleven years old my father made enough money to my mother we worked hard to get out we got out of the the bad neighborhood it got to Long Island and when my ... my father died he died of cancer and when he passed away was very hard for my mom\nHow how old were you I was a twelve okay so\nWhen my father died um my mother's down there was in Europe and that basically abandoned her for leaving and my father's family I'm a band that has also so we were basically now\nI'm at that point I was very hard for myself and my mom of course as you could assume so by the time I was Seventeen I was ready to get out of here and I decided to get out and I thought you know what am I go off I'm going to join the army that's what I saw it on the go join the army like my father\nWould be like my dad and go join the army so I go off to the recruiting station and this case they are all for recruiters in the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me son is going to be\nGreat we're gonna make you a general and and the moms and you're going to be you know probably in the world and meat and beautiful women and I'm Seventeen thinking my God this is going to be great and I walk out with all the the go army stuff in my arm book covers and still in high school at the time and he said and as I'm walking out the marine corps recorded there there's

what he said for hard yeah you're right I said yes and I signed up\nWhen I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that I Know how desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have\nAnd wrinkle gave me many of them and that was a a great thing that the marine corps of the military is not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I would've been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen\nAnd Norton Security protects against

one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I can actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward to going this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nIt does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed and they know it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party there were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock [laughter]\nThey will be a massive a massive culture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years that's my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete we would've education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government's\nNext to the culture of transparency is a problem with local governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what is that I don't know I I Know\nI Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty are due to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we throw it away awhile ago yeah [laughter] but yeah that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes\nHow 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending here's one idea that does both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got in a business guy like giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that's using the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd hundreds of thousands of cars pass at every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn that other ... hang on just like a Texas ... horses got Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he is the best part now we have them do what maintenance\nAgain we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right they begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lowest\nThing not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what well actually fix bridges bridges right now when you if they collapse we don't have enough money\nThe eyes do will have to have safer bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars an hour if you're a truck driver I Know\nOh driver you'd pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge less money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we\nAre running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have\nAnd embrace democratic socialism yes but we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the comments and Democrat and Republican\nWho has
