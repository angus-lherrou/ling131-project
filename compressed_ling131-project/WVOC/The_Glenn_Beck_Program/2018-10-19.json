Democrat let us all before the midterm\nPay for your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right how did that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people\nAnd here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he'd get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just hear in trusting your children to\nWho knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some there is and I think their case would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be\nA these things are so bad so bad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot\nWorse she can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite a lot\nOf the same thing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI've told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area is a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said I hate that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter] no [laughter]\nI [laughter] would\nYou stop and think about how you know pretty protective\n... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] oh look there are\nSituations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there in certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this\nOr is there probably are some but it it's just it\nYou try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of at every one is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story or and\nYou just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the ward invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner [noise] right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIf it feels like wait us they're just ... like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right like the overriding the security\nThat they're there you're coming in or do the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico's does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful a war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protected their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes from Nicaragua some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they're going to work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they then back to them if they do it without permissions they sent back to them but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to us and Mexico has a pretty stiff\nImmigration law they've got to streamline law that insurers foreign visitors and immigrants are in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves economically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding writes a that they think they have coming to them in Mexico you can't even\nDo can interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you know I mean that's a ...\nRacist right I mean like that is not there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't\nThink of one Trump supporter who would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanting to flip the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there is no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting I as a gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah St ... used this use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard any of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is\nBut it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the\nParty I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate and I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a mix Sally has a I think a great chance of winning\nOr people because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female\nBody of a congresswoman you would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah ... it's the ... of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truth or shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a one of the first female pilots in history and the air the air force incredibly accomplished yeah has a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know you're you basically have a coat paint worker a code pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be done early with cold picker denied any time that the rising her views I don't know exactly she ... she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again\nLike she like co hosted a show with someone who is the nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and you find that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona and its border state the big deal there ... is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yeah that's how\nHe doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly yeah [laughter] it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\nAnd upstate man is accused of sexually abusing five children and deputies believe\nThat could be at least one more victim devotees in Greenville recently arrested sixty four year old ... one after an investigation was launched last month the alleged incidents started back in two thousand eleven and then continued until last year the children and balls were between six and eleven years old at the time that they were allegedly abused\nYou might be

Albert Albert Gilbert Umberto Paul\nFrank mhm Blaine be if you have\nDon ...\nJak you or a Frank ... the ear called a better and Frank twice right ...\n'cause that's true or do we just learned that amazing accurate now remember I didn't realize too that it's not just El Paso and also on the calendar ... all over Texas is apparently what's true here yeah um and and one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIs it true that there is no example of someone named Robert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named\nOr what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert and people call you Gilbert apparently took that's how you do not exist you are not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence that you exist so if you happen to be a Robert an Albert Gilbert or an embarrassingly\nSmall baritone and obviously you're probably going to have a Hispanic nickname\nRight that's kind of a Hispanic man I Would probably better do yeah I Would I don't know what you would ... except maybe that's how I guess I I I don't I don't know any um people who are not Hispanic yeah who are named ... and and this is an opportunity for us a\nPet and do a two white white white ... we're talking Whitey Whitey to the ... the two of the white people you'll ever know with almost no cultural awareness whatsoever\nTo be learned here we can be taught about the uh Hispanic culture I mean Beto ... has been white explaining us ah some Hispanic culture here over the past few months\nBut I Would like to know from people who actually grew up in these areas is it true that every one I'm sure there are some examples I can think of one off the top of my head whose name Robert Francis a work in calls himself Beto but is there is this a common thing to the point of\nI Believe his standard was everyone who gets ... named one of those names in Texas or in in this community needs communities would be referred to as bad\nIs it possible is there a unicorn out there that is named Robert and his only called Bob is there's someone out there who is named Albert is called al ... is that is that a unicorn is that a mythical being or does that exist eight eight seven to seven back eighty eight Seventy seven to three to five\nIf you happen to be someone named Robert\nAirborne in El Paso or grow up in El Paso or lower mckell and yeah I mean ... are wrong the border and access in southern Texas somewhere I suppose it would also apply in Arizona right now or ...\nYeah any any I mean he didn't he limited it to I Would say Texas border area but I Would I be interested to see if this is a widespread phenomenon yeah is it possible cannot ... mother named their kid Gilbert and not have been referred to as best show their entire life is about a possibility I don't know I Am just not in tune\nTo the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please come in and and whites blame this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to to let ... let me let me just admit it to me\nThe ... referring to himself has that choke feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be true ... but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle\nTo understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert\nSo it looks like we have a a Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto calling from El Paso I'm Joe Robert yes it is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\nUh but I don't know if the this weekend traveling circus that Glenn will be hosting is going to be listed there but you look for it in your community as well or he'll be back on Monday a ... was talking about they caught a little bit here bitcoin was down forty percent gosh it was only over just a just a year ago it was down to Eighteen fifty a coin\nAnd uh you know you forget what the huge run it hadn't leap year that anyone who invested back before the giant spike of bitcoin is still up a whole lot three and four times their money from just a little over a year ago\nIt's hard to imagine that that uh this whole run has it could've been profitable that late\nNow she could to Ari from Palm Beach letter wrote an announcement or talking about how it would bring enormous amounts of money into bitcoin uh at the time he was Eighteen fifty a coin he said ... ten thousand a well as you know it went up to twenty thousand is still almost seven thousand now which is a much almost up to his so but the level he was saying it was going to get to it to its peak\nOr a T cutting out a like last year another big event is happening he thinks they can go up by ten times or more if it does it would be nice knowing you'll you'll never hear my voice again um but I really hope he's right on this one\nBut the point is ah if you want to

Roberts and your family your ... so and none of them go by bet so none\nOf them do what um what ... what is your background are you a boring white person\nI Am I'm born and raised and I get that question all the time are you military and they they know there are white people here in El Paso\n[laughter] medicine allow did they do allow that okay good ah that's interesting I I uh I have done that seems to be evidence against tobacco it does we really should report this to him when he goes on national TV and since these things you know the fact\nChecked hard today to get a ... day for them yeah thankful that my gosh oh wow very upset\nAbout that so that's well only every person who is called so far has contradicted a Beto yeah on that and that's\nWhy like I you know we want to be factual we want to deep deep deep into the science and that's what we're doing here you know a pat and I both come from a scientific background um and that's why we've always looked at you know for what one of our examples of courses betcha Weinstein who is a great hero\nIs amazing things so I ... I Hope we can get ... nail down\nUm let's see we got burden burden in Texas\nHi good morning I'm having so much fun [noise] there I have a twin brother\nNamed drilled into it as an adult way color and Robert okay or that you do you\nDo get better okay now is that what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican\nDescent town okay so Hispanic when they mean like ... ... ... ... or I call myself and American Axle indecent first of all\nMy name is bad but I like to be called burger or get this ...\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting and the kind of ties ideas\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that don't personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso as the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt ... when I came on the a lot of my information because I knew what was going on and stuff the casting they ask and everything when I found out that\nBad though\nRunning for Senate I knew he had used the veterans\nIt's a launching point and they need to them under the bus while to get his name to get his name nationally known and by the way my calling him personally myself I come in ... case [laughter]\nAttractive Ganguly he's got that way Adam's apple and it sticks out on them and\nI don't want to seem like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am ... an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she caused them to them but he never agent ... and ...\n... ... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a a there was an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama both ... ... it's it's sensible in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim\nYou have Native American heritage and in in your school and and submit to a ... recipes to pow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters right if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself or as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there is a real incentive and motivation to do it and we ... we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe he was called but it was a ... I don't know uh I it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him back home but if this is not he's not doing it because that's the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses [noise] Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from his campaign Sarah stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that all that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now people pressed him on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American it from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all\nTrying to be a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we'll know B. S. K. was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to BBS ... you're not him\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and I mean battle is Beto Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson will [laughter]\nAnd it was terrible tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing\nTurn of events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has got on I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through this\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years the the the left gets this terrible tease or they get to get close in for in a few polls Wendy Murphy is going to change Texas was the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a where you were to use them and when you're down there yeah ah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to\nChange Texas every time they were on somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to it no longer we're gonna have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return to state blue with one forever and by the way that part of it is true\nIf they ... they turn ... do yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard but still\nBe a Hispanic jak bag but it's interesting that that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back ... generations trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fourth yeah that's a major left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about the blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate their\nThey have destroyed or over there she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is amazing ah but the identifying thing there's two parts of that\nLike I said as they say that you know the libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it made no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King was to come out and say he's black when they're not black it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it effects me in any way however we have to be able to stand up for the truth\nThe truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that right to do was all is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embraces identity politics the thick world we need to curate [noise]\nAmerica now with me ... tonight at nine or news radio five sixty W.

I think he's he's climbing cake to write right this second yeah right I think they're getting their like their two thirds of the way to the summit\nSecond tier a highest peak in the world some people say if the highest in the most difficult to climb and we probably should have spent more time on the federal Glen Glen does not want to bring it up because you know he feels like it's bragging or whatever but yeah ... ... to this weekend you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go on the search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\n... because I think they're doing with this on the dark Web yeah a lot of ... last time you do yeah some reason he puts up on the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there are but we're we're ah we're here talking\nAbout a Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle of people calling in and saying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and they look there's ...\nIt says it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for Beddoes a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture or when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group in and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there was a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today a and it\nIt's it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be you know blamed for it excoriated the hours are it's just some unrelated group running ads in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation\nUm where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is an ad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your column whether you can detect anything seems a little odd here I'm here as the ad from the group supporting French so\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring she and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt it's actually for black meaning that Democrats can do that to a white justice at the Supreme Court\nWith no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said it didn't happen\nWhen white girl\nWant me to sing black poker gloom turnout always told myself don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nTo keep Congress and I think chair and the Republican because we have to protect our men and boys\nCan't afford to white Democrats take us back to the bad old days of rain but he said to just mention one white girl screens right\nPaid for by black Americans for the president's out into not authorized by any candidate for candidates Khamenei\nFirst of all I Would normally watch a show with ... I had to do that all sounds fantastic and these are obviously real they're making yeah right well the point of\nIt and it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is in a in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal uh for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town go back to Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't\nAnd entire communities white and attacked the black person\n[noise]\n[noise] you\nKnow what I mean the\nWay to train a business [noise]\nSo I mean the accident that almost an exact mission\nUh-huh he murdered somebody that we could yet we killed ... is your business though we don't follow your white men law now wait not murdering somebody is why\nAm I Hope that that's true no I don't think it is either and by the way his Twitter account still active in case you or what if you have a conservative that recently had his account of removed\nYou could still get Lewis Lewis could still keep mountains posting these are the video\nThe Jewish term I think was posted on Twitter yeah shut them down his his absolute Hitler son were talking about what this is Hitler stuff this is she at least a Third Reich stuff this is you know the architect of the third Reich Beto ... beers stuff [laughter]\n\nIt's just not right now as of now [laughter]\nThey're getting deep or getting deep down here [laughter]\nBut I think it's important to point out this is I'm not very it is that is the mayor and\nThe fact that he can get away with it with no repercussions still no I mean like yeah the yes if you ask the Democrat\nOr eating publicly will you distance yourself from this guy up most of them will say yes they will distance himself I have nothing to do with how\nThey will they will attempt that belly venue find pictures of them together right by like Morocco bombed out later ... but at least there at the point the only real repercussion this guy has has faced for any\nOf this anti Semitism is you know basically that he occasionally get they public denial from a public\nSource and remember he he was a he said that very early on\nWith Obama saying that he he said he would say that yeah he's got to distance himself from me but that's okay as long as he does the right thing\nRight you know I mean that's already been a it's it's a terrifying thing and the idea that I mean certainly the the you know we remember the million Man March right which was ... million but it was a lot of people are you the nation of Islam is not a a group of of twenty here yet\nWill find the Jews will not replace those guys from Charlottesville gosh that's a national story and we talk about ... years and years and years and years the biggest story of all time yeah I mean these guys you know it's a much larger contingency here much trouble eight Seventy seven be easy [noise]\nUse radio five sixty nobody ...

they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent she get that there's a range from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house well again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your ... made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um but I mean\nHe he's raised this wasn't even close better he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... racing and what's your what he wants\nMore in the in the uh if you compare quarter to last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than Brock Obama during his presidential\nCandidate that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win a now it's funny in the Senate race record he broke was the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember\nSenator lousy oh from New York running a Hillary Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick lousy it wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty and almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a big she is um and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the and the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately\nUm we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and now we just you know we have a going back in history looking at\nTwo hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate there's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there to be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of said oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ...\nI I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit I think there's a good chance of that\nI wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten ... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it will be much closer to the early comfortable yeah I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida and ... mindset Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the topic I ended up going to read yeah well I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida\nIt's a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm wearing them include talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as your brand they're all dumped all buck the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest concern of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I Am a crafts are now communist again the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake\nHere's a guy who's getting blood so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again a West Virginia is a state is probably the most pro Trump state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty so close to thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capable almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota\nBut I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mansion he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of but again this is the guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually was you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nUh but uh it is a winnable she'll be winnable seat in\nThis environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat your ear at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one\nIt would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that there are the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's a I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin Cramer so yeah that's looking pretty good yeah my seat there I think honestly you had two races decided\nBy the cabinet vote one was mansion generally like high temp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nDon't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it and then she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation\nHappens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is when we got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far\nLeft figures and good for North Dakota and for just seeing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things there but the dangers there as well I mean is\nThis is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if if that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and that's the thing they're going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which they'll find ways to get those throughout I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff\nIs going to be easy as long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls\nLook and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know whether this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats\nNow it's a point one percent chance really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no it's not going to get to eighty three right ...\nWVU see\nSince you were going to be pretty brutal to pretty much [noise]\nAnd the WTO senior center field trip for a Columbia official can resume is two days after some disturbing charges were dropped governor Henry McMaster this\nWeek reinstated city councilman mobile door up the district three council men had been suspended since last year when he was arrested for domestic violence against his wife after completing a pre trial intervention program the charges were dropped\nAnd upstate man is accused of sexually abusing five children and deputies believe\nThat could be at least one more victim devotees in Greenville recently arrested sixty four year old ... all one after an investigation was launched last month the alleged incidents started back in two thousand eleven and then continued until last year the children and balls were between six and eleven years old at the time that they were allegedly abused\nYou might be heading to the coast if you want to go to London\nNo you won't be taking the ship British Airways announced yesterday that it will begin nonstop service from Charleston to London I'm Bill trip for all news radio five sixty W.
