never never\nNever well we know somebody's lying here\nWe know we know someone is lying right do we still because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else about a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it any better she now that you moved accused she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a professor and be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the standard that's coming this is the standard\nThat we are now running to

flush it away\nGo ahead [noise] but I Will not to be part of it this is the American idea\nNow listen\nIt is so imperative that you understand what this is if you do not understand what you're

terror\nV. is la ... id is not Muslim ideas Islam is ideas that sure real law is the prevailing law and if you are not under surreal law you're an infidel which means I can kill you I can rape you I can turn you into a slave\nThat is what the war on terror is all about and we will never win it unless we name our enemy\nWe would have never won World War two if we were fighting the Germans we we're not fighting the Germans we were fighting the Nazis\nWe would not have one in the in the civil war had we been fighting the south\nWe were fighting people who didn't believe in the constitution we were fighting for the freedom\nOf all men that's why we won and by the way if you don't think that's true we lost every single battle up until the point\nThat Abraham Lincoln said this is about slavery\nLook it up we wouldn't have won\nThe the American Revolution if it wasn't against tyranny it wasn't against the king it was against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea that you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry\nWhich will play directly into what they want to happen they want us at each other's throats they want us to be irrational they want us to be angry they want us just to start swinging and blind rage\nThat's their plan\nAnd until you understand what they're doing until you will understand that this isn't really about Ford this isn't about the charges this isn't about anything\nThis is all about the patriarchy this is all about white men have put together in this case a rape culture and they have kept people down and it doesn't matter if he really did it because\nThey are white men have it doesn't matter if she was really a victim because other women have been victims\nThis is about collective justice\nCurrently entitled social justice but make no mistake this is\nCollective justice and collective justice\nTo put it into the terms that are Christian will understand is anti Christ\nCollective salvation is anti Christ collective justice is anti

buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a real disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a quick example I'm just I'm\nA couple of weeks ago\nI'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple eyes gyms a movie store found that three movies purchase had that we had been deleted from his account they were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted ... off of people's candles\nAnd including a ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to really sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kindle um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tinder all but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on\nBut also because he watch things like that happening in China if you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it but it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only\nThe hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um the these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered directors ... edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh ... almost ... force you to I mean because they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now that's right you can't ... I mean even ... I mean think of this even just for comparison\nYou can if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to when they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is this a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own sort of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access\nIt through their ... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n\n... so that allows you to store those files locally on your own device but cars that Kendall is tattered through soft where right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nMuslim Hubble can you talk about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way they forced everybody to have it exactly [laughter]\nThat's bizarre you read about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a section where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\n... you ... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you\nHave that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk of but a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change\nIn capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of it\nWere four years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh ... well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good [laughter]\nAll right and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can mount a case I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces are for barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt I don't know what's going to happen to\nOr nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there is if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of work together and figure things out uh because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this\nThis bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and uh you can have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and it's all made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold mine\nJust look at numbers find out for yourself is the world\nHurtling towards a fiscal sanity or insanity\nOn state ... more Colombian we like to fix\nUsed radio five sixty W.

how you've been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term what we are likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur and the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured rules were going to start to see people become more and more accustomed to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways\nI think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car that necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application and I think\nThat makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from a shit and towards temporary access\nA shift away from independent control of resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe many I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not gonna when we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I ... I don't I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nOr they are is a great example\nUm we see this issue come up in the motor vehicle context or the ... the way it come up um uh most most recently most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the long running American farm equipment come ... makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be it just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\n[noise] I I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative that discourages people from um from as he said ... with the same as it they are we have a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made over the centuries in this country\nThat didn't come from giant ... deeds apartments they came from individuals messing around

looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he is the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary this out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it [laughter]\nIt is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank S T he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been they are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and there's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that right\nYeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what Google doing but we can look at the past\nUh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner or was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed his work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are saying they're assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb\nAuto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is due to write that going to a dictionary that will always change the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes some real problems\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabin on me and I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a his hero of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain story [noise]\nUm this is a thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something for my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the point is is out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really come and see anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not been she's voted a different\nWay that wasn't that that wasn't a real armor [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm trends parents right why will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back\nDo you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com beat her twice there is a with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the plant forming a and kind of a role in from our last conversation
