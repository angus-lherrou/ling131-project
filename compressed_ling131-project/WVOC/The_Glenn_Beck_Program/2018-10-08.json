we're bombarded as you know by all kinds of information and all kinds of media sources or a you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff

they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like\nA Google Search engine they turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what's higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate or one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you\nKnow that is scary\nIt is you are you lead us out in the in the creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrectly you have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy thing there was that the very very few people who could spot Tobias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent\nOf people in

overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat or not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is well you know from Facebook's own published data that that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifting boats and think about it no one knows if it's something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day or they were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't

we're there I've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour why did that affect\nYou so much um couple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that that these big\nTech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do um you know and it but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of case um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousands sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks they've known in all this is like\nA lot as a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility again comes it comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to as he described and so you know Hillary and voter right right\nUm but beyond that uh it seems incredibly helpless to me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we\nMove how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and they're slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right ah and we talked about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily 'cause I just do it right it's but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wind myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm and I'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating us you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one it's because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know ah the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is a bit better than the other ones I've ever used it's it's been a you know I'm ... I mean\nYou know as you get into deep stuffing you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know all apple products right use Google\nFor a ... search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go deaf duck goes a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using that and I went to ... go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say three\nHundred million word\nYet documentary ... is like a ... of of\nData on you and that ... million pages and pages of data and again like but I I don't know what is the personal cost to me in that data well there's several things\nThere are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that's in that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that it is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to\nThe problem is not today this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth in ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said\nYou read the uh chapters on a technology\nI remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah but I mean it fail in their right right it's it's\nIt I mean if you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years\nAnd he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it back that up yeah and that's that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think\nAs a catastrophe ... right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a road search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton is not some wild crazy theory it's something that already happened in his over where are they now\nWhat are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw the left really AK ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're going to feel justified to take more overt action and you got only knows where that ends up I I I I I mean it could go in really bad directions [laughter] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives you really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people that believe they are right to the point that the others have to just be either re educated or eliminated\nLet me ask\nThe Democrats ... you'll have fifty percent of the country that just does not honestly seen the world the way you see it\nWe are just as set against what you believe is right if you believe that socialism is the answer capitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nI Am against that\nOne hundred percent and I will not comply\nSo what are you going to do with me are you going to silence me at what point do you feel that you have to kill me\nAnd I don't know I mean you can make the argument right if you're a a left wing or right and you're using search results to move the people in the right to correct direction than left to be more accommodating to all these hated groups that you believe evil people dislike\nYou know you could at least the the pathway to thinking what you're doing is just right like in America you know he's a hand with China I don't know how you see it I mean I you know to to be able to to assist tobacco government doing what they're doing\nIs terrified and they certainly claim to not want to support it but I don't know I mean I don't know how you do it I understand the access to that that uh that market is entirely but I mean it it seems like what you're doing is putting real people in danger\nI I Hope we're ...
