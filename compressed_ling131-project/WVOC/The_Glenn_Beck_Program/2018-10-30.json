House\nPresident Trump speaking to Axios on HBO and confirming that he will sign an executive order ending so called birthright citizenship for babies of non citizens born on us soil\nWhat what what do you call that\n[noise] you know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming the reason why you have to stop\nIt is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can't control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\n\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here\nUnexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching saying that\nComing to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing what'd you think\nThat would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know what they're not common ... que they they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I sure be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders the new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time\nEmergency situations always give birth to emergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act are truly examples of many\nI don't like emergency measures that's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door and stops all of the side windows and the back door and trees\nThe country needs either serious policy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall\nBecause quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\n\nBut I'm Sorry CNN I don't know what\nYou want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and to fall when they're throwing Molotov

away and this is when we get to see what the chart a little bit because we have had a lot of races in the middle and they sort of toss up category you have 'em because Poland's been close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nAh and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota there's going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep thoroughly nervous right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling is a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tossup category\nAnd we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to date a again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat\nPulling their you know I still think that's going to the Democrats but it the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point uh and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for the Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is the starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big hope for pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe Manchin I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin Oslo yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the ... category but for a week away we gotta pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house from\nLexington by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck

I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually\nMeans it seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the cops\nYou should as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it'll be entirely there is yeah I see that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs of the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would\nBe allowed or not it was going to be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine Chuck\nSchumer and ah and Nancy Pelosi writing up that brief as a friend of the court's come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not get it to not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with the Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad\nYou know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes oh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump\nThe most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play can we play

surrounded by socialist\nLook at look at look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite\nThat's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is not\n[noise] I did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so at my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nOr you know a ... a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that attack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late\nLast waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story so you know that is when I saw this I said you know what\nWe need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turned on it purely because we're conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that they what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by\nSo few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative\nUm and and anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets to ... among conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the eye heart radio a pod cast a shooting I radio shooting I heart radio ac\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick I'm I have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly\nThe that the business people\nLooked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great get she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty minutes kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her\nAnd that's when the social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any ... validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the and the entire me too movement had a big part of that it a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know pretty brave in doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering\nAnd they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become\nJust a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a given birth to a ... I think that that is is one of the main reasons why it didn't help that she was a conservative and was easy to get rid of it because of that\nUm so yeah I think that's what happened\nAnd egg and Patrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith or say there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on 'em in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is\nA we actually do an episode or that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow to construction workers\nThat um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this crew\nThat uh that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about that have lost their jobs\nTo chew a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this year I think that is the care of and it is not for political refugee status if people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that it it does um one hundred percent ... out of that because a lot of these kinds of\nA labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the the homeless crisis and you and Los Angeles is is that there is is the drug epidemic there are there's a thing called patient and we actually have a story coming out on that I'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare\nTo fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using then using the the health insurance\nOr they end up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically ... rehab tourism here in the in the Southern California area\nThat has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless church of of course last you know basically follows the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to\nObamacare as being part of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here\n[noise] um you're covering also one other story I Want to cover it with you why does the black community vote almost unanimously for Democrats [noise]\nYou know we are that's where we're releasing two episodes on Thursday so I'm not I cast as launching this Thursday and I are radios a podcast or treat me I Am and one of the episodes is on this question and we speak to Kansas Owens and diamond in silk and we get out of it and you're not on why I'm\nThe black community as vote voted on almost unanimously since at least the nineties or eighties and what we're told is is that have been condition in their entire life to vote that way\nAnd um they use the tool of racism and and the and the and the big claim of racism to kind of scare people and and ... there's no other community within the United states than boats Ninety percent plus for one party\nFrom the W ... wind whistling county sheriff is publicity apologizing for jeopardy on a force fact is laid when he called a very\nIntimidating behavior is is that a black alumni event at the U.

time I had a unique insight into this storm one of the producers on my TV show approached me and said I've got to go to Michael's ground zero\nAnd I said ... why what are you volunteer and he said no that's where my parents live small town Mexico beach that's where we're all seeing there was nothing left at the time he said this details were scarce\nBut things were looking you know like it was going to get really bad I said just go take care of your family if you need anything call me a mercury one is already they're providing workers aid in the area so whatever you need just let me know\nSo he left he disappeared for about a week under the radar and he came back and I said how are your parents how what's the situation what does it feel like he\nSaid glad I've never seen devastation like this before in person I've never the majority of the town was just wiped out\nHe said it was so weird driving up to the town that I I go to all the time I visit every year and it's not there it's just an endless field of debris\nHis family home was still standing but it needed to be demolished and bulldozed\nAnd they were joined in that regard by many of the friends and neighbors in the town he told me about the storm surge that had swelled the fourteen feet clearing the coastline homes of belongings and leaving strands of seaweed across the second floor ceilings\nThe smell of mold and early rot permeating the air unless you've been in a hurricane you do know that smell but once you smelled it you've never smelling like it people shoveling broken wood in shingles out of the way in hopes of finding anything that they owned intact\nOverturned tractor trailers fishing boats that had been hurled through walls and windows it was a beach side paradise apocalypse\n\nI asked him I said so how are people doing how are they holding up are they losing faith I mean they've lost everything\nHe looked at me and he said Glen is exactly the opposite he said everybody I talked to last week none of them were talking about the blaring headlines\nHe said nobody was talking about climate change ... you know a policy um you know what they were questioning his does my neighbor have enough water\nDo you have do you need something can do you need help do you have enough food to last through the day\n\nInstead of writing nasty editorials about the lack of government assistance and FEMA's\nCompetence folks were just doing what Americans do they were helping each other ... over the gaping holes in their rooms at one point President Trump arrived marine one soaring low over the town flanked by futuristic looking a spray or aircraft\nOne very liberal leaning family member\nLooked up and said wow isn't that something\nAnd then immediately looked back down looking for anything that they could salvaged from the wreckage of their life\nThere wasn't any time there wasn't any need to sit back and rail on the controversial president so presidential entrance\nToo much work to do too many people to help is what's so frustrating but at the time we're wasting there's so much to do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city":
