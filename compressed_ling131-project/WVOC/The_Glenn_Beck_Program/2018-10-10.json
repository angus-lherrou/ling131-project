B. always the pilots Robert what\nTo say well I'm certainly not justifying everything the president Donald Trump says on Twitter sometimes I cringe when I see what he tweets in the morning but ... there is a reason he uses Twitter to reach out to the American public directly there is a media thing jak that's come out with a new study\nOf four weeks over the summer that found that Ninety two percent of TV news coverage of the Trump presidency was negative versus just eight percent positive\nYeah probably flipped the other way to the Obama years I'm guessing more than likely are we getting ready for Michael back in the morning it's six to get us through that throughout the day tomorrow I'll be with you will see a bit by by [noise]\nBroadcasting from the studios W ... and I argue or any of the nation available\nAnywhere you go on the hard during\nFlorida Panhandle it's about to get hit with its worst hurricane ever I'm Dave Anthony Fox News Michael's out our bans have already arrived in places like alligator point where ...\nWhere he found a dirty word of where it's going to make landfall and it has this Big Bend area that is under threat storm surge here is coming in excited to be twelve to fourteen feet a whopping majority more than ... percent suggesting hurricanes or heard from water events\nDrain on your\nProgram\nThat I think though about Hillary Clinton everybody know she's like\nYou know what I mean every nobody buys nobody buys her act anymore no which is really nice to really at well CNN Christiana autumn poor she's still buys into it\nYeah I I don't know that I wouldn't really make that distinction I don't know who cares what she thinks really either of them\nI mean I I mean it's a voices that I I almost can't here I guess so little about what they say almost like they're cutting woods in for it [laughter] and I are falling and nobody's airing it and I'm In the middle of a city\nYeah many many hundreds of miles away I cannot hear the trees but yeah I Try to remember I watched something that was so outrageous\nLast night was it and I thought to myself wow I'm really not outraged I don't care and I just don't care\nIt's hard I mean there's a lot of stuff today I mean they're you know the things that the people that are trying to cover this election and the you know the cabin on thing are actually saying I mean they're incredible it's as if they don't care what the words they're saying mean well\nWell well for instance let's let's use this because we're changing definitions of words are here is um\nA here's Brooke Baldwin on CNN they're talking about how we we we've got to be\nCareful because people are going to be hurt because we're too where we're seeing mobs start to form here it is\nI Believe it's the overreaction of the left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without a doubt that\nThere's no other way it's going to put a stop on the mob in what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia too I was going to go out and do what we saw chasing me right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court\nBanging on the wall what do you call that\nCivil protest or without a mob I think if he is only a mob yeah and if there was a party or as we call it a mob ... come on I ... I mean because I saw lots of\nTea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way\nHave plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because we're supposed we're supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children you\nKnow and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what is it dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to they were trying to get the the Tea Party\nTo become a violent mob they didn't can you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd\nIn Washington DC you would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty\nBy the way I mean you know you can talk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob there like charging cities and they're taking over it that's the I shouldn't that's a riot\nThat is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob please look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we know what we're talking about\nMob mob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly intent on causing trouble or violence okay and and the quotas a mob of protesters that's their that's their usage\nSo is this not a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to what it was a\nKid goes hands on causing trouble in tents on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh's a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess in that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying though is that the media\nDoes not the harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a currency that that's like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good\nFor the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are very high and the Irish guy or [laughter] let me tell you the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob BS I'm going to call it a mob a now here's Maxine Waters trying to say we're trying to redefine protesters mob rule here it is\nProtests is guaranteed to a a democratic society we know that this is guaranteed to us about the constitution they're trying to change the description of protests and call it a mob well no this president is the poster boy\nFor what a mob a protest it looks like he is a matter\nOf fact he's the one who has been violence in his speech his wife I said things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what you and say okay that's not the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violence in their speech a let's go to Jennifer ... adults are at us and she's the network president and co executive director at the center for popular democracy here's what she's saying to the crowds\nLawmakers and leftist continue to push protesters again to sorry\nSorry [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nTill they go and where we see this now here's\nHere's the problem let's ratchet things down just a bit and listen to somebody who says\nI think there's real trouble underway and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory bookers shake it up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat is it realizes that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which state's college was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot these ... who's almost killed he was showing this is for health care catalyst in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a y ribs broken a pneumonia lung conclusion all of that these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means for trying to resolve things\nI feel that there's going to be in a fascination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting their face\nThey have to realize that they bear some responsibility of this extra hours\n[noise] so do you remember the time when people like Rick Baldwin in CNN were lecturing us that you couldn't say you're going to target a district\nBecause that of course led to violence couldn't target ... district remember the lectures of your words have power because you don't know who's listening to them and we said unless you're unless you're endorsing this we are calling for peaceful rallies\nAnd they were and they were\nThese are not peaceful how many people were arrested for the Tea Party\nRiots mobs\nHow many I don't remember any\nThere's four hundred just last weekend on the left four hundred that's disorderly that's not a peaceful protest your words do have power because you do mean violence\nNow how can Glenn Beck even say that well I'll back it up when we come back\nIs an understatement of the year can you say that a lot of the parallels between the two hours aren't perfect they're not perfect but I did one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today\nPolitical rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then\nI mean the fact that one of the two major parties as embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism or the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nWell okay um\nI guess I mean it was Adolf Hitler and Mussolini that said that ah FDR is one of us he is a fascist so maybe it was bad but there's more hang on\nColombia's most dependable traffic mornings and afternoons news radio

won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst Ed's stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are\nThere's a lot of built up outrage\nThat is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here to Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there are challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven and ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way\nAnd you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd de Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he\nShouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path to the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach a people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are it it it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why a you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S\nThat draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference between the two and you know I'm so for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot and Christians in the age of outrageous\nIs to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all\nJust strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack\nAnd our art type has always been Moses and Jesus and we take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling ... who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type back in just a

it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating upper called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect
