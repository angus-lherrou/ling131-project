I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this might be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this a front running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're sitting with regard to the turnout is\nA smashing records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs a but in many of these locations\nAre the first day of voting exceeds the amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know that part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people are going to do something to stop it\nBut here's all I can tell your audience and that is\nIf you care about the future of Texas it'd be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election here because there are other people out there\nWho are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure\nYou go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo I'm covering a lot of times people have said you all of the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I've always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nWell he he captured the U.S it was very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats either rent under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and didn't they were a progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist ... and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor\nIn Florida a isn't out now that he says as a socialist and then the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open borders policy\nThat is socialism or with a look at the the wealth distribution of gone to see that is socialism and people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate in Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's\n... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and uh the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this letter George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a hundred million dollars or directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston but this\nYear we paid a million dollars to a candidate in San Antonio on top of that you as rounded these grand games to get out the vote and so he used quite a turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and us on TALK of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and counties you have a Dallas you couldn't you have San

time that never has\nA but we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times the Pennsylvania seem like it was odd to me that's going to happen and they never did until\nThis last election where it did turn over but I think the more interesting race those the ones for attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running and normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with details that I think is\nAlison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before\nAll these sort of accusation started flowing against key selling not true though is it him in the bathroom with a guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegation that is I don't there was a new allegation the guy on a repeated I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was an idea that in our area that yes yes yeah a little bit or or that one or not true is it I mean I don't ... as I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet he the same in charge against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man and editors\nBut we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is a famous\nUh and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about Chinese relationships break up and there's\nThings said and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed\nCavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations ... it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out\nHe now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points

him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win for I mean it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise\nI mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up\nA instead is forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go\nAh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four feet are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a seat it's forty six excuse me forty ...\nIf you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races\nThat includes a Tennessee which is still very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burned and then in Texas so leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than you did a few got a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can do three of six they're gonna be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can\nPull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed\nOr so you know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could still lose it to they could easily still lose it possible that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and uh you know that it's a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially\nIf you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThat lecture and by numbers\nOn

I haven't noticed that\nA hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans were the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years\nShe's bought it from a goal but within a lot easier right why us for back when it doesn't really\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word\nAnd write this down on no not going to do that very high path occasion thing again are you\nI'm just saying and read it yeah when you hear it your blood will run cold when you hear\nPeople actually talking about well the problem is ... that's when you had to the mountains [laughter] that's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss re high ... that's when you run for the hills K.\nRight now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold and who's gold really is it all and all of the central banks buying more gold\nShe [noise] what is it they know that perhaps you don't know\nMay I suggest you called gold line and I'm not asking you buy any gold I just want you to read just their report that is out now on what a democratic victory may mean to the United states and to your financial status\nRead it read the report I've read it I recommend you share it with everyone you know\nThing we were talking about this off the air a little bit 'cause you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we talk about nationalism and in the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing um however ... you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look where the best country and were you around it and we have a great the best you know culture and the land and we should be\nA you know patriotic and and and be a you know sure excited about that but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways\nYou know like I say that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or go to the gym talkative and now it's a different kind of ...

hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're fine in their country\nThey were trying to get a new a political stumped\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march\nTwenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhether you who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere\nElse weird them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this\nVideo but if we could play this a video or if you have it ... the video of ah the migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks are being\nTrucked from place to place from photo opportunity a photo opportunity\nYou point of the stuff that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up their racking for a couple of miles of cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get the nature of the draft\nLook at the audio video again role that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise] just count on even just count them as of right now you wanna get out of the ah well

that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the law in their lives and\nUh the um\nOne ... okay now so this isn't women and children\nWho are these people are we know that MS MS Thirteen that now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people and\nI Want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one ah yeah I think it's a I think it's\nCNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement ... if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nAnd I don't think they're going to wind up in the country or reckon can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in wanting passwords for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou see this as an invading force these people they're not only legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying we are a country that is always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our

wait for the left to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof\nJust recently had a problem I thought that was okay no I thought that was fine\nAnd with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of the yang in there and some of them are rapists yeah well I think\nThat's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I

oh no no they're driven out on [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's the I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before MS thirty in the United states constantly is is this is just the Donald Trump fever tree this is nothing [laughter] it's not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate of school shootings so if you think it was Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue\nWhich I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful save if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals\nGetting into a Walmart yeah ... that's what this is going to be Seventy five hundred people try and just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all they're doing and this is Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because there is a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states in the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders cause you know what that is\nThat's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's uh not anger out right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end up going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor a tech I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know the only reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border\nThis thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are\nAre National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it and people are jealous of an for

the\n\nA minute aggregated into one place and really led to band together and so that when the blaze promotes opting Prager you and conservative review and Breitbart benefits and likewise when they share something you guys benefiting hum so it's really the app is I'm going to come out later this week on 'em\nAnd do a play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content um that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these that company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you I mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we're trying to\nDo is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked a bright bar we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this we're we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook mhm so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your contest\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um\n[noise] uh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if we if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know they can't sell that we can sell the libertarians to Staci into older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty some things that have\nWho are are naturally\nSo
