C.\nFifty on a friday morning you know that may help staff of the game ... great\nAs former Carolina quarterback Jeff grants joins us in Jeff let's start with last week certainly a big win a pivotal when for South Carolina as far as getting some confidence back after the Kentucky last but let's talk about quarterback play in Michael ... what did you see that you liked about his game\nEverything Christopher uh he was poised he was prepared for the ball very accurately make great decisions and just as overall leadership was a impeccable\nI think this is drawing ... fans into two camps one who won a seat Jake Bentley continuing one\nThat wants to give Michael ... more chances to play ... let me ask you this did did you feel like the game plan was any more limited for ... than it was for bin Laden and does it matter that it was ... versus a different team\nWell I think you that it's definitely made a difference that it was Missouri but that wasn't quite as good as some of the other differences that we encounter this year and yes I think it was a little bit more simplified\nAre not totally though he did a lot of the same things that are Jake was asked to do but not quite as much\nAnd Jeff is it any harder the second time around and it was the first time starting the the adrenalin there but also a team has a little less to work with as far as your body of work then they know a little bit more about your game the next time around\nWell sure I mean they've scouting him now and it is a little bit more difficult but she's got to go out if he gets his chance and I know I got to start and lift Jake struggled we've got options there now that we know and don't have to worry about for me the key is going to come in there and we got options which is good former\nGame ... quarterback Jeff grants is with is a Jeff I wanted to jump in there because you mentioned options so you think it is a possibility that we'll see both quarterbacks in this game against Texas A M\nWell I think they're going to of course Jake is the starter he deserved it earned it and uh you know through practice and the last couple of years he's going to because of an injury can't really take him out of there but he's going to have a shorter leash I think now so if he struggles\nI think you're gonna you're gonna see a change and the other way around too if if a scar goes in there and doesn't do well ... got to come right back in\nOur Jeff one of the big issues for Jake ... late last year at College Station was the fact that his off into blind just didn't give them enough time to do anything to game ... couldn't run the football and couldn't protect Bentley so what does the game ... got to do better in this game this year\nWell they got to continue to try to run the football they're not going to be very successful run into football against this team but they've still got to keep plugging at it and keep doing it they can't get into a one dimensional situation and that's going to really put a lot more pressure on on the quarterback so even if they average\nTwo two and a half yours or carry they're still gonna have to mix loans off in there and and\nNot just go through it every time\nCan be one dimensional against the Aggies no doubt about it just great to talk to you enjoy the game tomorrow and we will chat with you again and a couple of weeks is game cuts and joined open date next Saturday and that's the best game kind of covered right here on news radio five sixty W.

eight percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I think the media in at eight percent directors\nHey let me just say I'm a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that we in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways\nOne of the ways that are tied it in\nWas that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees and they sent that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters\nWithin a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay no that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never having pose any thing\nOn this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made him I was an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on any

long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out ... where is going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're going to separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day as a as a new beginning go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what I was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false ... it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever come forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do\nWe cut ties

explaining why they had a hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with that no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he

tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are\n[noise] I I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve ... kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] that are just moving in with pat when he was the second best one hears you to have had it he's number one and then space by our space butter space by your number and say right [laughter] how moving why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow I we actually talk about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time because we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs at our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I've had I I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week um we had Dave\nRuben who else a stew here recently Michael wrecking walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress areas\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and an enemy\nAnd a liberal and a leftist an opponent as someone who disagrees eating maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know liberal is somebody that wants government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nLondon is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside outside of that Haiti\nArena I agree that there are you know I see that most\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you\nCan't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest into all she has no injury wants to end you want to share a country where she just\nIt's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd roe v Wade happens a month later\nAnd she decides not to have an abortion and so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheat and want to be a kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family because they've gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable\nNews at all or any later I Can't I Can't ... do you watch them never that he was it was up when I'm On the year ... India and unless that status and\nHang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job agreed without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... me too long form it's just toxic ingestion and the vast yeah and my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant\nOne of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election and she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when rock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist\n[laughter] me away wow okay yeah um and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is find mice Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we are five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\nThat ... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help and so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like we're not communists right\nAnd so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communist they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and capitalism\nWe when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down and do the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believes America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time it actually totally in reverse the majority of it and and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the the libertarian myth of the libertarian voter was how they define them that that voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guy just tend to one at minimum it's not even close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government\nWith better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat nist\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\n... ah um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with many sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four go but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with this stability thing\nThat they're completely ah issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change a say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we are we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're Balkan iced they get the reference to I'm making here\nSo okay well let's let's pick it up there how do we um how do we come back and and how do we start\nReaching out to the people who actually do have much more in common with us because
