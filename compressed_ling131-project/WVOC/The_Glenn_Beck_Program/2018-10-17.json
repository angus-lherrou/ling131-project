I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nAs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though she was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\nMm but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a\nU.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation and torture and killing\n\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story but this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true\nFor her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if it's if it exists includes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him and you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the\nWhat's described as the path all adjust or from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you'd need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may be an Archduke Ferdinand moment down the road this may be the thing that sets the world on fire that doesn't seem like the thing that could set the world on fire\nBut Saudi Arabia is our ally we are currently fighting the war on terror with Saudi Arabia who we are currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Yemen\nUm we are getting ready to sell billions of dollars worth of more machinery to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is quietly supportive of\nOf ah Israel now in the middle east and are taking strong stands to support Israel they are also a an ally with us against Iran they are a balance of power\nIf this tape exists and this tape comes out we have all known\nThat Saudi Arabia is a bad place but we have not heard the screams\nIf this tape exists and comes out people\nWorld will for ever think of Saudi Arabia and put them in the same class as stolen as Hitler as Mao or as Kim Jong own\nUh in in ah\nNorth Korea but we remember North Korea's crimes we only have sketches of if this tape exists and comes out it's a game changer that could destabilize\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation and you better take this tape seriously because if\nI were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and time to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas\nWe don't need it we don't need it\nOpen up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down

don't think they've taken every\nDime true yeah I mean difficult to find more to spend a writer for ways to spend them first there's millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full inherent it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets I couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had a zero athletes at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from that on was the idea in in a

easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at All right uh so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nCan they figure out another way to

hundred I'm not sure it's any more I think I Do think ... you know could be talked into it\nPretty quick oh yeah and if I probably could be a Roger Williams or the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this

husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg is going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows for Bloomberg are very smart\nI by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there but other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen I I Will\nTell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for running I don't think in twenty twenty ... twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's\nThe reverse you know ... but they're they\nDon't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPretty near to the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself why not sure that matters really matter anymore\n... smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because\nShe doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House ...\nExtremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right you\nMight you know this was in her time the next time around I just want to go up against Trump or certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about ... and what is going on in the streets of Portland more with Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com and don't forget his new\nBook is out killing the ss which is fantastic uh pick it up and grab my

wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility at all\nThe way to um unfortunately because there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAlright they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is it ... really want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me and maybe and teeth all hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon\nI mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process we want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets in mass beating people up and telling women that there has been shut rotten a grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent\nGot any politician saying the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your

held talks today after meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised\nWhy why were all these people executed in\nThese people were executed because they were leaving the caliphate these were people who had been wet and do are more than likely the full three years of the ice occupation and ... and they were done they wanted to leave they wanted to get out of there because as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolute health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by the ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into decided they can't run away because it you know they looked like me are white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so\nThose guys had to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth\nYes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as her infant\nOr getting ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize shows people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly\nAnd I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and I met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist okay I'll all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing\nUm [noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their ... or done several trips with the ... in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians in ...\nSo we just saw what happened last year with the ... and then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these tribes [noise]\nIt's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject a surf class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just add a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me\nSo I brought ths abroad with me several photos\nSo you have somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize I think we're getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\n[noise] of of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you handy photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people these are\nSome of these are it's that's a that's a baby\nThat's a baby intentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away I Survived for about twenty four hours and then died\nAnd this just looks like it's in the woods\nYeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and the farm army still wants to attack them and take more from them and\nSo every time I go there every time the ... find shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the test for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we

C. dot com joined them movement [noise]\nGlenda [noise]\nLove new program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond and Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see\nIf you can spend as much as a democratic socialist [laughter] it's a game show that I don't think you can win no I think we all lose in the end and I do is\nThe sad part of the sometimes though Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really\nAnd we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em is\nGoing by it as he used to call them so called right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all right so Beto is running\nHere in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen this you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and coal bare hands free where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars\nAnd going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like Cruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change but\nWell they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN their poll ... forty five\nI think he wins by twelve\nAnd maybe as high as Eighteen I made that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that's when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran but I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won he won by three but I I just think that there is is something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it\nTexans are going to say yeah I think Ted Ted Cruz\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible I'm interested in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in life is\nIs winning by a much larger margin or ... I don't have the one and right in front of me but it is over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here it is yeah I Know you know when there's so much he's up uh eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven in St Paul were avid is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... you think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however uh the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas look at it this way try this on for size\nOr a Donald\nTrump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Columbia", "day": "17"}
