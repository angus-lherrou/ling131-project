B.\n\nI'm Dave Anthony Fox News I Hope we can say no to mob rule by voting\nOr at least said I have no knowledge of it the only thing that existed was the accusation that right there is the story of the past three hundred and sixty five days\nI don't know what happened to professor Ford I have no idea I don't know if there was an actual witch craft that was being practiced in the woods but I for one am not willing to declare someone a witch or war lock\nWithout hard evidence I feel bad for professor Ford I also think\nI wouldn't want to be around her in the afterlife if she was lying\nWe do know\nThat at least one of the accusers was lying we want to believe people because we want to believe that there's no way anyone would do this\nFor politics that's the goodness in America don't lose sight of that goodness do lose sight\nOf the fairness that each American has that is why what is happening in Washington DC is going to bode very very poorly for those who are involved in this smear campaign\nBecause Americans are fair and what they've done to the capital of family is very public process has given us a glimpse into what it looks like when the rule of law is replaced by a mob rule this\nProcess has been ugly painful and hopefully it has taught us the big lesson the presumption of innocence is one of our founding principles heat is why we came here in the first place\nAnd if we abandoned that principle what happened to judge Kavanaugh will be the standard for all of us and our children\n\nTo October fans listening\nRight now [noise]\nI guess maybe I should have taken off my doctor back in the white jacket or for that amount of ... a month\nTo do I'm Still I still have to do in my care after uh doing a power our was to to\nTo uh to just to to be able to see is he capable of being president or um you know or or Supreme Court nominee and the future after drinking six beers as Brock Obama said he used to before he went to college now Bill O'Reilly is here hello bill\n[noise] back how you doing\nI'm I'm I'm good I don't well how do you think this cabinet things going to come down\n[noise] are they going to be confirmed um tomorrow afternoon I'm\nGuys but as I said there's a the forty at this time [noise] but I I think he's going to be very hard at the ... the slash a\nGap for any Republican to vote against them because there's new information and I don't know whether you guys know the new information because the media is not reporting it including Fox News morning to Wall Street\nJournal I'm Dr Ford's people that includes her lawyers and uh her advisors or tried to get a woman named ... ... or to change her testimony that is in the FBI report apparently\nThat ... was the best friend to Christine Ford\nWhen this incident about cabinet allegedly took place and was named by Ford as an eye witness ... all along and said I don't remember anything like this I don't even know judge Kavanaugh\nWill now the journals reporting that a forged people and they name a woman Monica McLean texted keys or and said hey you got to change your testimony you gotta help Christi that's a huge story\n...\nThere is also another story um that are in the FBI testimony that it shows the leak came from Chuck Schumer that it was Chuck Schumer's office in cahoots with one of the beach ladies that Ford or talked about\nYeah well I don't think there's any doubt about Chuck Schumer or Dianne Feinstein at this point that they are corrupt\nSo bill ...\nOne more than one language Monica McLean by the way this was the woman who forged ex\nBoyfriend told a Senate Judiciary committee that Ford tried to help her get through a lie detector test\nYep because she was applying for a job at the FBI there's now bolsters the ex boyfriends um account now this may seem in the waves but if the Judiciary Committee and I I Believe rationally may do this I Hope so he\nCould all mine I'm Monica McClain a and a others in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if that happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should be doing it showed to here's here's the anybody\nKavanaugh allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nHere's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right if you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart and it a little what if this\nTwist coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who uh what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening\nAnd as soon as he I'm Sorry to ask do he's been drinking this morning bill you wouldn't believe it or the IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah I'd like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's OK rights\nDo then is it better state for you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so I'm a ... there's there's one guy who came out and leveled accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this was the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you get when you get into a situation and and this goes right back to the need to think we're talking about did you see a list so malign oh\nYes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed it doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've\nDiscussed this before you're into ... you are no we don't care you know if\nSome guy didn't do something like Kavanaugh whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice social justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation\nIt what matters is is communal justice\nThan it is that other people are talking about and the media will never report on is it the same people\nNow show up for the oil or Republicans\nWill vote for a cabinet because if they don't they're out of the Republican Party\nWell only sets it like and he's already out of it you know he's leaving right now he's leading that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's going to hurt him in retirement as far\nAs good burnings are concerned you know where he is\nStill I Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's this is really important vote and who knows what happens in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I Will be my daughters I leave my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways\nTo vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married daughters get married um maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some reason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right well she's believe me I Know on that I thought were there to God\nThat says if you want me to give\nYou so now we got to give us two minutes on on killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nReal life yeah she's on me which is obviously but she loved me and thought I was good so you didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote it says with an eye on explaining to the reader that these concentration camp guards and the people who kill babies and gassed innocent people were farmers merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this they weren't assassins\nWere regular people and once the war started they put on the black uniform with the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\n... in the book is better than his explanation or\nKill them comes out Tuesday\nColombia's home for Rush Limbaugh news radio

like that's all I I Know the ... eighty thousand foot view of that life but he was talking about like\nChristian culture growing up in church just south of sports\nLike these are kind of area where I live like right after this bit of this was like a lady that has a Bible verse for every type of situation and people like how did you memorize all those versus like\nThat in my head that's just I I live that life and it's just in my head I memorized let's just do it so you're going to be a great comic stick to what and you know a lot of people say you should like when I went I Lived in Hollywood

heard of\nYeah no it's it's it's amazing to me that I ... I was amazed me where\nYou don't have to just go see it in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah 'cause comedy is very ... subject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what\nThis guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you the he looked like somebody\nYou don't want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders has looked like Glenn Beck I Know he's [laughter]\nThat was going to go into a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this bill he looked like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man has a Hitler [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable and I have a new world better than us [laughter] I was a that has now this isn't helping because

write the nineties alright yeah I'm just trying to get an editor so she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have\nGod in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God among everything and she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church for and every time you come home talking about\nThe people who were honking at each other ailing yeah they're running the park and oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how\nPeople are in church and they're finding that but they're ... they're looking\nAt their watch like nobody was on ... ... ... yeah yeah yeah they want out which is he used to that video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is because I make all these\nSome I make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of 'em don't just probably like your content of your books yet sometimes when people are like\nYes thank you we needed a sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like\n... what was that one that connected or not that one that connected ... yeah 'cause you don't I don't think you can have to be a Christian too or good church going person to\nYou've heard about that mhm from your wife and the like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah\nAnd it's just a what's funny is the juxtaposition of ... you know God first serve others I mean\nHow do you live in ... steps away\nThe human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on TV and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human like you can spot in sincerity and why the everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come tonight\nSo to get to come and you know it\nWill bring up on ... ... people people\nOr like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's what our

us the truth out here you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go\nI think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line\nYou don't have to say anything right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual actually felt\nYeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want\nTo say but you don't as I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke in my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does
