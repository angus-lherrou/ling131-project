would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and admitted that we were wrong but it does not have happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise but early on in the process\nWe ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been a recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked also very very hard I'm\nPeter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah ah so this was an an immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work it was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and no one has a little bit of background in some of this but this was ...\nEarly having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career\nIs to get papers published in well established journals of for example ... is one of the journals we got a paper and and I ... is a feminist philosophy journal was\nProbably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted and seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you are twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you pulled those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and unable where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are a sponsor this half hour\nIs zipper

argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the

it with compassion that re centers the needs of the ... over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and led to fit in that without being contracted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the debt for a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for
