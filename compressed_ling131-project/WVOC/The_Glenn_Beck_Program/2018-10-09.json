really the opposition are the people leading this leadership but the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right in Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party\nAnd what I see happening with my friends on the on the left his air out a party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a ... for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nAh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference in unusual

back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain

you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book or let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good um I overall I agree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay\nYou're you're um you're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all of a job than and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need at least have a conversation about\n... because of it yeah and I you know I think we need to be

or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general it cannot than they work unless I'm so I'm coming to you know at different perspectives\nAre having done that research that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely be able to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about\nThree four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty\nAnd the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington\nI'm Talking about the people who are studying or the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for\nWhat is it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nOn state can bully
