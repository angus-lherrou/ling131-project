Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing she doesn't fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats highest levels of interest in the election\nWas only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Saturday and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this the territory that has not been seen before and ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nAre relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now to show you\nHow close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite in ... and\nThey revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know whenever the down by five in the polls winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing ten feet from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before when they decide they're going to vote\nAgainst the president so it's an interesting a way of looking at it and it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's\nAbout a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they're these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of ... oh yeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that is one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real\n... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... there is an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten or at fifty percent independents are almost\nAlways going to be lower in a high interest then partisans because part of ... gauge more like generally um this type of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from polio and I wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean I Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nThey don't like the overall system there's one other interesting it was sad to hear Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that with a wave election for\nDemocrats [noise] it's I mean\nThe only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees what else has happened I mean you\nDid have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for that Saddam after okay hum all the October ones obviously after ... and include the migrants caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen to thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick because this\nColombia's home for Rush Limbaugh news radio five sixty W.

that about the caravan of seven thousand migrants headed to the U.S saying he's alerted the border patrol in the military because Mexico was unable to stop it in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador quote neither so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nBetter mouse trap or app or where your worship bank because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi\nIn California and hundred centigrade aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our\nCountry or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually\nHave persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really\nBuilt for short term media collapse that is what they're doing\nThat I'm In I'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of ... restored downtown and I'm All right now and ah there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans in a given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\nAnd there was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still\nReally only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored\nThem [noise]\nSo what is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nYes ... a a pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have\nThe shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is\nWe believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our mall but I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new

I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I hang up before I'm sure some stuff started without many Haitian go in the kitchen absolutely on them and talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because ... testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well ... and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across his entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined why you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do think that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and almost by\nProud of Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about what he was ... really do anything mhm somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world\nWithout and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nLet me give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better finished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want I Want to make sure that we have some localized central I'm the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators\nBecause here's the problem with getting ready to sign an ice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose that four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that four billion and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows were riding grants him and it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that the two counties across all city to going to fool sharp by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more than a traders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish ... over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teacher you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now he takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one of ... told me he said Larry my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the\nProblem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and for a new computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think cause you write for me I go to a two year ... to ... prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever great off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who have had to serve us the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nData he'll get yeah [laughter] so um so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be boarding school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and Yossi to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job\nWhy not go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I just don't have to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife ... she's going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know\nThey'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money banks love most guaranteed government money yet they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere is the best part when he schools pop up now
