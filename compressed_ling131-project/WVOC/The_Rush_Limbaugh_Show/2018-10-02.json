politics writer Harry end in about CNN polls on various Senate races that are with them or close to the margin of error to question polls are tightening out there know the question was\nOh my God [laughter] oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God no well what does that tell you what what\nWhat what what's going on here\nWe are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the Monterey Republican wave in the Senate in out in the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house I don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate\nUnless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to what to convict if the Republicans hold a senator even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim surely couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave wet\nAnd\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on it you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm an only get a little a scientist observation about this but what did I tell ya east generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping\nOn this and back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots rarely might do it frequently I but I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting answer we're gonna

choices\nTape resumes that check stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds have the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of\nOnes they've made layers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it\nWas a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time third quarter\nFinish doing your job\nSame thing here holes in January\nIn front of the ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but the polls do not give any indication the final outcome\nAppalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none ... zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine all turn and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he's saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat predicts you to mind went viral as Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me start ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting and all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just being tanked opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will fire buddy you know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team as when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news buttresses some of this from the hill dot com ran state Democrats face nightmare scenario on cabinet\n\nIts articles shows beyond a doubt the Democrats are brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce camel you realize the latest defense and New York times has run the story saying that Brett Kavanaugh through ice\nOn a ... bar patron back in his days if you ate all\nHe threw ice this\nGoes to show just how on fit for the

allegedly raping her they thought that\nWas not worthy of being published are printed that wasn't enough to that I mean put some ice on that live there nah no news there\nBut Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly on a buyer patrons stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualified\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope ultimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have just just like\nThe mother investigation murder investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers so the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support\nIn Washington by Republicans if they could get his approval numbers now do the twenties 'cause they succeeded make everybody think Trump treated with the Russians and Trump would lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there's no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the Mueller investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with him what they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh

was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but CNN's the only cable out and there's no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh\nAlready really conservative websites or start everybody starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh\nI I was living there was not going to accept that were challenged the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan\nAlicia shortwave radio this is that by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know there there are techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the

was a cover on time magazine an artist did his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman\nIs thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\n\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year

satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to uh get the sun by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on
