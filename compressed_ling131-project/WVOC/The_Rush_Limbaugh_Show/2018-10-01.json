toward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's fair it suits button light and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine balls e for a new it's seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she's\nSat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for a point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't her what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns back to the camera we need to make it\nMr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night by saying oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and ask them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here\nAnd ask to undergo his seven FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us\nShe turns back around so we we didn't do it with German as though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was statistic strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have

the lengthy commute\nIf you're gonna boy they having to put on standard business attire why not the only reason you\nWouldn't as if you don't have access to the company's computer systems or the documents that are at work uh and that kept you from getting things you needed done done\nThere's even a little story this developed about the uh her use of safe way that she shopped\nIn safe way a lot and that was new and the reason the the theory behind that is\nMark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book it was it was supposed to be a fictional book it was it was a it was a an aide to attempt to help him through his\nProblems it was not a memoir and in this book it talks about safe way\nAnd he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself with a Safeway where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is\nDevastating the inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world how did she get there\nThe idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans are not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing\nHer performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you can see yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\n\nAmericans believe her and most believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent\nWho are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent thought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both were believable if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the borders are told that the name ... witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation it ships from forty four percent or fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after\nA week agrees there is no cooperation for her story\nAnd they've already done that but now we've got a call me entering the picture now we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of

I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow you you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican\nDoom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that predicts shouldn't set it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon\nWant to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more\nA bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term

June or a polling mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not won the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't

ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites these are from the oval office was during a an\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminating NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe Dr ... under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kavanaugh things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls there aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election they were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope buddy FBI investigation into Kevin ... on your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change she's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any you know how to best statement about him he's led I think he was number one and the plastic yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me ... let me these soundbites them got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise]\n... this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote for a vote for final confirmation silly FBI that's been at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fate knows claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are thanks to find the Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing his best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr solve it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks ago so the White House has now claimed there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then\nThe question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday\nIf we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward

House tells FBI to interview anyone necessary for Kevin inquiry and this is because of what they claimed Trump said at his press conference today where he's\nNow I don't want to limit anything I said guys that that that ... they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not\nThat's fake news so then they've got it on record Trump not limiting and best which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting\nAnd everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four people they want the FBI\nTo talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to ramp up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nHas somehow incomplete\nSomebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she sounds were their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything on like Bob Mueller face stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is

and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\n\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the capital hasn't been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible cabinet was not\n\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolute bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it\nEither no such thing but he sure fell for the bait I Am not limited and the thing I have told the FBI to take us wherever it takes them promptly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI you say there's there's some
