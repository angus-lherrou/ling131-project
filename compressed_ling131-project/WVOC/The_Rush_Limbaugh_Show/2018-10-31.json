quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated

Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIs it why is it why isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it which is the design and it's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever capital I did that led to the fact of capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that he has like\nIt's been career deserve to be destroyed so\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets to convert get ... get the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was\nSuch a rotten S.

our ... come on in a way to Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trek karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a ... examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again walking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you realize\nThat what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved\nWith gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only ... Romney healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful and we were all a lot of

wow you know very was\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it is not going to learn it from his own history books they're all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln I John Silver Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey and the most popular\nHigh school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in and American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a ... a socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this good but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Ellis at Ellis I not only by the way we are they checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly\nThe immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nAre you ready when apple announced that the new ... book air is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThat young people in that in that room\nErupted into a game standing

most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for a life to be sustained when they

make their case to the mid term elections President Trump will hold eleven rallies\nIn eight states he is again a great contrast between Republicans and Democrats are going to see him lay that out and I think it's going to be a huge difference make\nUh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that you have\nEverybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in\nTwo thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats for forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two\nEverybody thought everybody to\nDemocrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going\nGalvanized Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and it was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats the left was\nDone to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain\nWhat's going to happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest grow roses the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day\nAnd I got to read the whole thing it prints out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words\nWe know nothing on certain days alone as Mitt in terms of their final stretch\nTo twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober\nMind to the elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states or the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not just ... days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially\nThis year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other couldn't be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the streets trendy here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you\nEvery reason in the world is ... ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness\nOf many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec or in New York's\nTwenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot\nSo Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here\nNeeds to reexamine things [noise] and then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning however liable arms on this thing and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens to want to go to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I happened to us why this idea what's going to happen but in my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise] and this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea\nNo idea but\nDressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nFederalist that's right that's right he was a Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and the other way beyond by us if if that's true if a number of these things are true then there couldn't very well be a major surprises and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this and the bad\nAnd that that will you be as the new center finally fuzzy dominion energy is asking the same sounds like Service Commission to reject fancy Cooper's

five gutter online all states the most gutter dot com\nJonathan there was a headline in the state newspaper about how Lindsey Graham wants to support Donald Trump and and the birthright citizenship and in the story in the state newspaper they actually miss quote the fourteenth amendment so I'll read to you what the state wrote all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens of the United states\nAnd of the state where they reside period that is not the fourteenth amendment I Hope some people do a Google check I Will read it to you the way it is written\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of oh what's that line yes that one line makes the world of different subject to the jurisdiction there of meaning that the parent has to be subject to the United states in other words they can't have another citizenship\nSomewhere else they have to be well I guess you could have dual citizenship but somebody's got to be a parent of the United states and just to prove this point a little bit further Jonathan\nI'll point out a story that I read from the guardian in August of twenty Fifteen that says every Republican Congress since Nineteen Ninety One has introduced legislation to undo birthright citizenship that is not what we're trying to do what we're trying to do is enforce the law\nThe two full frustration is is that they don't need an executive order from Donald Trump nobody need legislation introduced by Lindsey Graham you just need to have an effort that we enforce the law under the jurisdiction thereof here comes the argument right back at us on Twitter ...\n[noise] you know my friends just like you protect the contents in your wallet and your purse [noise]\nThese days you have to protect your
