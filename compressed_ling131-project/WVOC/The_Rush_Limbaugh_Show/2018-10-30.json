met with opposition everywhere and yet\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me just say this just being John Doe upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remains supportive of Donald Trump but that will get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of\nThem are committee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that holds the\nWhite House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're\nAware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring maybe they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not going to stay at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and\nThe Senate\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Laura Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my ... great news for [laughter]\nWhen Robert my great\nBook grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic in critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the red peel movement\nAnd the great awakening movement\nThere is

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for as many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nAnd all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nYou watch and results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue the issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that I'm a ... in junior high intramural football and soccer ball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results\nOf an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one is not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

hits Nineteen Seventy one to Seventy five and this week\nIn the year two thousand the number three song in the country was banned everyone eventually love to hate it was creed within arm's wide open\n\nThere's is back\nTo the phones with all this is Dan and Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a ...\n... ... ... it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right 'cause what's causing this was causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth unlimited abolish slavery or the southern states worked in ... so they passed laws are close to where so restrictive the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that the dose black folks were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original engine\nThe fourteenth amendment was never intended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the night\nBeing sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass emigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties\nTo assimilate that's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright that didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there's no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're ... our population because modern arrivals don't all seek\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points the the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate gone surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company gotta we gotta do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being said if that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you have ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that Senator Graham is going to offer legislation to the Senate\nAh look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has\nIn Arizona door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and we're not going to stop these\nCaravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here because these people aren't capable being hired anywhere\nYet but I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a sure political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI looked no wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R

the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street is always you know what it is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight\nWas that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I ... valley and I am\nTelling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go\nThat has been the criticism and what does that rooted in rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in they never\nUnderstood that you already believe what you believed you already

with your friends and that's why you're glom onto would\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\n\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ... ...\nWhere is there real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is\nBut the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there

Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral\nSeats at federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so gas if if if what the media dead due to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and er and accepted and it's this arrogance\nAnd just the premise here superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you\nHave a synagogue shooting wallet he obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\n\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who knows they are not by definition spreads numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the electoral results just in the past two years\nHere's a indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
