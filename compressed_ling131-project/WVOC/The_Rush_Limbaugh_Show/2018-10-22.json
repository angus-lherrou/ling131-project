handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your show ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass wrote that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and with\nPeople down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to\nCome to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms with the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody's ever know whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was maybe a narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born\nYeah but then there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it'll put sort of things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump may be what they're hoping is the Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with\nTheir stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite\nEverything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get him\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance at Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role\nIn transportation but there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden undecided all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people to sign to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see\nPictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think let me we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell it I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the devastation in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for tourists because boy and the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk it enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop and slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course uh the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report that a second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThere are hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of

it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report\nAnything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho in their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who won their right mind would promote this would want

for\nAmerica\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intended across the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world is so damn hard to understand about\nThis I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are

permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world\nCome on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any\nThing in the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at

who would exploit them were also concerned about this punt pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and

invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military does stopping invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and now\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you

what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's

to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near\nThese kinds of rallies these ... these kinds of

invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture\nA seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico man look out for those people are really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing

good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I I'm One hundred percent for putting a military all the war\nThis one is perilous and we have\nTo be careful\nWell when when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this this is not a military invasion of talking about a a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYou know I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes you one question going down and squeal or like a pig and then it so we just have to fold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if\nI'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lewis Lewis proposition\nNo ethic initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWild and what is it what's the preparations ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\nWell let's let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not it may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold a line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably what Bush or\nTalking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit than it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it\nIt essentially storm the bullet storm that guns you you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they were met with equal strength for more we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is to let them in\nNope nope half to hold the line at it and like I said somebody is what Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay All right so the responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the network morning news we did on\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\n... helped me find them back home prone to my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the ... ability even book appointments on line and with my wife loves knows is at home in ... is completely free to use\nIt at home at ... dot com or download the ... to get down to\nIts people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well our investment advice is about to you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life feeling secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out\nTo try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of census last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the when an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist and really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective no that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective\nHe hid it would be a disaster for Florida right now is well liked anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing white gang busters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them\nHas a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible new is the thing that worst time for anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida\nRick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a\nJust a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not but the\nSanta would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with\nTrump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing here and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past ... if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where\nThe president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution\nThen you'll elect these Democrats I Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supported because he's the last line to hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your own life or is the government better at running your life the Democratic\nParty believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me and and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put\nBut one of these up on the digital camera if you're
