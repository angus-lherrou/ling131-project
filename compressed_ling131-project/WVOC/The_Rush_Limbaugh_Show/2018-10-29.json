amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is supportive but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it

kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're willing they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's the Jewish state\nAnd yet there's there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in the religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish\nBut I totally disagree with everything Israel doing that and yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a ... because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform of orthodox and and and other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism I Need the this they're anti Christian too\nUm I don't see\nThem as necessarily being Sunni Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's it's ... I got\nJust ... that's exactly right but this is where Mrs all headed this is all headed toward ... anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nTrend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else it bears no\nUltimate power that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's acts than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so ... how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say but you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it\nSo this has been in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't and I I don't\nI don't feel like that there's a million people out there are targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because of the country is so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty\nHe he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI'm Glad you said because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much a\nRe July presents racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the

like\n... now after ...\nIs there a say a dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCesar ... and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you\nThink the odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember\nEven Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they provide this ... this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the\nPresident what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution

they cannot be proven but yet they're already has reported as fact\nGleefully I might add so now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] [noise] you know\nI I don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international political expert\nAt what have you and I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces\nIn advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise] [noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners in his behavior and his ah\nCompartment just as a presidential you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment crabs so he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative for me to get do conservatives they're being brainwashed in an echo chamber for rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other van and

audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected\nPrecisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about him that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about them that way but Trump did\nAnd so they all start laughing they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting\nAnd they say is not going to laugh that's crazy that Trump kept\nSlowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a

started the two years silent cool\nAnd that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that\nI or anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and is doing in corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power I think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done in the past two years\nIncluding the

... loaded with Russia to steal the election for two years Mr\nBoat for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been

my final summation that happened on friday about why we're suspicious\nOf the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results two thousand sixteen and it was codified epitomizes if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the Trump\nI Know they're psychology\nI Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just ... beside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not going to believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where

times CNN intelligence community resources from Iraq and intelligence officials tell the New York times ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a year two

get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans bother it's independence never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\n[laughter] I have to win it\nThey've told everybody that the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of it and
