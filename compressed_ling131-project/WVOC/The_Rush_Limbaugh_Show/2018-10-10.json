soon as possible you have seen a right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just say that some emails on this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse your Web but but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump seemed to have any real interest in seeing doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\n\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe\nTrump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not convey proper information about him is his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City\nWe're back to the phones great to have yours are high\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you L. rush but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best that in ...\nUh should have the ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically\nLiberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are ... but the question is do I do I agree that\nUh our society has always trending toward a barber\nIs what what barbarism in a\nSociety harbor resume or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of nowhere either trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what was your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\n[laughter] well I'm the Democrats at at that time their basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws\nAnd a win for one purpose\nBut my point of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted in the\nModern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in the\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on the militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just masking less today\nPeriod you know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt\nWord a lobbyist morning news we dated six to nine\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

Kavanaugh event is very very bad it's attacking the integrity to court\nAt Trump said I guess that's why she lost she doesn't get it she never did\nHillary said what was done last night in the White House is a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court reporter during a press availability of the oval office asked Trump about our comments\nWhat's your response to Hillary what's your response to Hillary saying what last night's swearing in was a political event\n\nGroups that I guess that's why she lost she doesn't get and she never did I knew that a long time ago Hillary never got it that's why she lost\n\nHillary also said yes it is that the the sex claims against her husband are not\nLike the Kavanaugh's confirmation because her husband\nFaced intense investigation\n\nHillary has a point we have to acknowledge she has a point the allegations against her husband were substantiated they were investigated and Bill Clinton was found to\nBe guilty he was found to be guilty of all kinds of things Kavanaugh is not has not ever will not be\nThere's not a single allegation against Kevin northern has any evidence or corroboration but all of the allegations against Bill Clinton had been proven Hillary's right she doesn't intend to be\nWhat she is right the allegations against her husband worst substantiated Bill Clinton paid an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar settlement the Paula Jones\nJennifer Flowers had audio tapes of his come on to her Juanita Broderick told others about her rape immediately\nThere was a pattern with Bill Clinton and sexual harassment there's no such pattern with Kevin Oh speaking of that did you hear about this Jane Mayer\nPart of the duo Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow writing at the New Yorker met second story the New Yorker came out with that not even the New York times would print because they couldn't validate any of it Jane Mayer showed\nUp at what was it the Atlantic [noise] there was some kind of a\nConvention or festival or some such thing New Yorker reporter James mayor suggested that in an interview that she ... Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told al magazines and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge Hannah\nAt or above similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff there wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story that isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Kristen Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you're waited high\nHigh right very very close to talk to him thank you\nUm so I was just wondering I was concerned and wanting to get your thoughts in Internet fun of it yesterday but with my role as it is and it's Hillary claiming that their pain neatness civility right now I'm I guess get worried when the\nMind and he left and the act in ... and then fattening or if things again to help people um it just hadn't have worried about provoking violent and um you know to the point where we don't do anything for a child Byron Pitt Trump stickers in our yard on our cars", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "10"}
