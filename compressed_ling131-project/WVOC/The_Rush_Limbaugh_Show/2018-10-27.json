possible without feeling uncomfortable giving you that peace of mind that comfort that's what we're trying to actually create with that financial plan\nAnd all of that starts in our first new costs new obligation retirement review that's an opportunity to sit down with us look at where you're at right now most importantly look at what you want to do what do you want to accomplish what are your dreams what are your goals and then we want to help you figure out if you are right on track\nThe goal is ultimately that could potentially be your first step to building a custom built retirement plan that helps you see everything in order to make sure you're on your way to their retirement that you've always dreamed of\nTo get started call now at age ... three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement act now for your retirement review by calling ... three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nIt never hurts to get a second opinion on your retirement plan and if you don't have one yet it's never too late to get started so call us now at age ... three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nTalking today with pets truly he's the founder of preservation specialist has been going over the most valuable asset\nYou had heading into retirement some of them are tangible some of them are very much what you think your different retirement accounts maybe your real estate properties some of those are the things on your most valuable listed assets others are a little more intangible your health\nTime that you have ... what's the final item on our list of most valuable asset for retirement\nYet in the last one I have is advice and as I think about this one comes to my mind is it Twenty one years of experience and how to night and day difference anyone listening right now think back to Nineteen Ninety seven so when I started okay\nSo if you had a question about finances it was really helpful to have an advisor that you could talk to because it was hard to get information that we're we're talking you know the early stages of the Internet we've got dial up you know maybe the dialect clocks out all you and yeah you know you can't get through to AOL and all that kinda stuff\nWill manner we spoiled now you know they used to be you could just go to Google and now you can ask\nSyria or ... or whatever you want to do to get these answers for you\nSo it's so different now Gen that it's really\nWe are in an age of information overload and you know we talked about Social Security on the show today and you say well I'm going to Google when should I take Social Security and you're gonna get literally millions of searches\nFirst of all who wants to read all that and who has time to and and also how do you know it's reputable so that's where we believe it's left just kind of giving information to you and now it's about building a trust relationship it's about having somebody that you have a real relationship and that's why we love\nHelping you build a retirement plan and then helping you execute the plan\nAnd then make the appropriate adjustments over time and now you're a long term relationship with somebody who knows who knows what you were looking to accomplish\nThat's where I think it can be such an enormous difference from what a financial advisor would do Twenty years ago in the last thing I'll mention about that kind of tie it back to where we started is the other idea was so much information you may be able to get that information but it could take an enormous amount of time\nAnd is that what you want to be doing is that when you think of your dream retirement is it okay now I'm going to block off Monday's spent all my time researching investments in the economy and interest rates and things like that\nFor someone who comes in and hires us the answer's definitely no they want to understand the plan they want to have a relationship with us and talk through things but then when they are outside of the officer not worrying about it and so they know what's in good hands and so those are a couple of thoughts I think could be valuable\nAnd I think that's important path to talk about the information overload that's out there because as you said things are so different today than they were back in Nineteen Ninety seven the technology that's available today we have these\nPrograms now these robo advisers all these online investment platforms where we can really try to do this on our own\nBut you're still saying maybe that's not the best way to go right\nWell I think ... the term robo adviser has become a huge topic in our industry time someone asked me if I'm worried about that are fearful of it I say not in the least because there's not a single person that we work with\nThat is looking to replace us with a robot or we have a real relationship it's not some type of algorithms that has spread sheet\nNow I don't think that a robo adviser isn't necessarily the worst thing in the world if you're looking for something that's incredibly cheap and you know straight forward especially you know maybe when you're younger maybe at ... advisory is a great thing\nBut if you're investing ten thousand dollars when you're in your thirties early forties\nThat's a very different scenario than maybe accumulating two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million dollars or more and you're about to retire maybe that's a time when you want to have a real relationship with someone who actually understands you and what you're trying to accomplish and then the other part I Would say is\nTying that investment plan to all this other areas and that's where I think ... the things we're trying to do are so different than what a robo adviser is\nPatty had any final comments for us today I'm most valuable asset for retirement\nVillage and there was a fun topic and I think uh like you mentioned there are very typical things on there like for one case in IRAs but there are things maybe you wouldn't have thought of and I think time an advice or two of those\nHow do we make the most of your time or we don't know how much we have and how do we make sure you're getting good advice from someone that you can trust and those are the things that we at preservation specialists are just passionate about\nTwenty one years in the industry and getting to know our clients overtime and realizing just how valuable those relationships are we go through life cycles with our clients when a parent or a spouse passes away we're experiencing that with our clients and understanding you know what's happening in their lives\nIn when you're retiring when you have grandkids born all these types of things that are going on\nThese are huge things in our lives and the finances are probably not the most important thing but they're still important and we want to make sure they get taken care of properly all of that is about having a long term trusted relationship with a financial planner and those are the types of relationships we love having and we love building\nTo get started and see if we are a good fit for you give us a

I'm watching the rewards pile up I'm feeling inspired energized and there's nothing I can accomplish\n\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixteen percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump\nThat they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happened down that road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nThink anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is the Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard there but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network infant didn't want to blast so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let the ... they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get it if if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role\nIn transportation but there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see\nPictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people killing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps and San Francisco for tourists couldn't voided the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles a day\nYou could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to ... thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand in the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan than we are just hearing about\nFox News ... ... S P report that his second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already crossed into Guatemala\nThere are hoping they catch up to the main group\nAs the massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing\nTo join the main group which reportedly and swelled it ranks with several people who've already been the port in the caravan which has around five thousand uh seven thousand members\nWas on the move again Monday morning departing the southern may cause city up ... to ... the smaller group trailing entered wipe them out of from Honduras late Sunday according to be a pay\nSome and the second the caravan are said to have experience in getting across the border it includes a number of deportations have some of whom have been sent home multiple times\nEight twenty nine year old they enter Anthony ... is reportedly was deported for the six time from the U.S five months ago said they catch you and you're trying to get back he has a son and a U.S citizen girlfriend living in Birmingham, Alabama according to the Washington Post\nSo ah [noise]\nThe border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people and not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's are gonna sending people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Jeffrey is talk of the Jefferson I won't even know who is who you're talking about what was\nJeff Sessions' Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all\nGreat points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted\nAnd it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprise as its eventual anything but I think this is the left\nBehind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold it took\nWhat time on the ... there in the dining room with the bomb bomb bomb bomb\nGot a brand\nVeto\nDon't miss your chance to win W.

violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow is it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how is it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this would want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people in the store on the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEvery bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once cakes\nWe have somebody finally\nPushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals\nThemselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but in the world\nIs so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft is because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nThey're being driven soulmate by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people were right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mass the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we may as well\nNot have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\n\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is the six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the

in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution and governor can call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nYou he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside laughter seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike and Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump soon as a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the best people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's an almost a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot\nDifferent ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we

just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media they've had Republicans who are elected properly intend to David\nDavid able to persuade you of the various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside\nJust roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it after\nAll his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer as afternoon show\nAt some conventions setting in\nNew York city and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling as to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes\nAnd he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up\nThat divides us horrible\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind the Trump and see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works seats so Trump Trump is he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything and so\nTrump is ... is working is spend golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are\nWhich takes me to want peace that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when in computer science professor at Yale\nChief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump and let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nFor a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations\nThat Kavanaugh fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kavanaugh episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties and nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they are\nPainful this is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hate about America\nAnd hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they have his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals they hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American\nExcept exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nInvents and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph is instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people this is not right and everybody has their you you you sound\nWave to you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love equip vacation they love people see both sides of the things they he reaching out with\nThe heart they hate certainty especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy wants women doesn't see the need to apologize for it\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in Ryder shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it [noise]\nThe difference between citizens who hey Mr Trump and those who can live with him\nWhether they love are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nLeftist intellectuals I Know say they dislike such people in so far as they tend to be conservative Republicans\nBut he says they are laughing wider the markets impossible to transport food and clothing or hug your wife or a girl or a traveler ... with your best friend over the Internet you can't do\nMany of these jobs over the Internet maybe that's obvious\nBut to be an intellectual means nothing is obvious Trump's no genius but if you've mastered the obvious an ad commonsense\nDuring nine tenths of the way home scholarship is fine but the typical modern intellectual cheapens his learning with politics is proud to various teaching with a broken down the left wing junk\nDavid Gardner computer science professor at Yale\nBasically basically saying the real problem a real problem is all you people voted for Trump you continue to ignore your betters you're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or as you are ignoring the media who are trying to warn you but you persist and go with the Trump rallies they can't stand it\nThat's why they make up these stories about gigantic blue waves sweeping you out of the ways sweeping your candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to except they're the ones that are losing elections\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up looking out they're lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she is bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump than the people that work for him brought\nUp under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is is this what the Democrats and media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled with range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out that Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them\nAnd now it's time to make it All right\nAnd they are convinced you\nWhat Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to Henry persuade you to join the\nSo now you're part of the problem\nAnd so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes\nHello this is Roxanne took some\nTime on the ... here in the bombing was the bomb bomb bomb bomb\nGot a brand\nMeeting\nDon't

you'd want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's managing for him\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're different people and all they want us a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in all they want is what we\nWant we all have these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't walk and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight\nThousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in

okay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday Tom\n... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics that was among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics\nThey're analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere\nFrom Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight have been Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look saddens anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five of them sort of two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesize and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple to Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sent an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to but there was

legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy\nWho is in historian who has studied the American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks at things he's he is an absolute red wave and he did not believe\nUntil last night he's been seeing trends in the past two weeks but he has been reluctant\nTo convert into these transiting with actual prediction until now\nHe says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is crazy ... the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nDemocrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive buys a showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late changes story written before the bombs could it happen again you probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says but it could it could\nGo either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go and ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden\nVersus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really really close\nMuch closer than we ever ever knew gets a cycle and

father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very\nMuch Russia you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh\nWe have a dangerous dreams right when you're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq who said oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain you know quite be there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point
