Ford and the pressure came from a former FBI agent again who's one of the beach buddies of Dr Ford's if this isn't witness tampering somebody needs to tell me what it is Charles Grassley\nWas on Fox but Grassley as I mentioned at the end of the yesterday's program Grassley has been on fire some thing has really\nSet him off I Would think that it would have happened ... years and years and years ago but whatever something has really set him off now\nHe's going after the press accusing them face to face of out right by us he's accusing the Democrats are being insincere\nDoing great harm to the Senate what a grass leaves points is ... and John Cornyn two if we're going to get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof what are we doing for every future nominated comes before this committee\nIf the new standard is is it all the nominee has to be is accused\nOf something and that kills the nomination and where are we headed we're headed exactly where the Democrats want\n\nUs to refresh remembered bossy foreign and ... were were ... some of them are some say best friends at the time of the alleged attack by cattle\nWhen Kaiser's denial was brought up during the hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee balls the Ford attempted to this credit her by saying that what she's got health problems can't ...\nI don't know but she was not well I I felt really bad for her\n\nTurns out the legal in ... there was a former pro golfer she does have back problems but not mental health issues ...

it Murkowski who voted no a lot of people are asking is the vote now gonna not going to change I mean if if the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote fifty one forty nine you know folks because I'm going to tell you what's happening out there\n\nI have I have been made privy to some of the comments not just on social media but so the officers that so many Republican senators are getting their being Daewoo used\nTheir entire families are being threatened\n\nTheir grandchildren are being threatened their wives their husbands bar made everybody they you know being threatened\nIt's enormous it is never ending the phones don't stop bringing a threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving in his honor hinged it is vile and it is evil\nAnd it's not just like an colonies and mansion it's all the Republicans are hearing it is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say they've ever seen\nIn that regard Jeff Flake and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only\nMembers of the pain\nProfessional mobs squat on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nDon't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in is it's not technically a vote for capital it's of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always says that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term or the\nEasy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and received the praise of the mob and received the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious wave he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator from Maine I Can't describe for you you might\nHave an idea you're probably know the things that are being sent to these people the for rats that they are getting\n\nBeing alive and notion that we live in a civilized society it's

are all identically manufactured in the same phrases all over them\n\nAnd these people I don't know if you've received threats and I don't know if you've been ... by them\nBut if you have an if you believe them they can on an interview and yet flake and Collins did the right thing here I only hope that they're able to maintain their positions not Collins has announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nOf course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she would vote yes on the

Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by E N Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass when his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely wouldn't produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitted that she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed elect attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let them see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed as a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector\nThat she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce and Grassley said you're must be you must have something to hide then he writes I\nUrge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in my

here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance\nLeadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so foreign heat I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns medium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed\nIn touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo uh never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by

last night\nAnd she is\nExplaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day and that they didn't sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms of the words in her study of things\nThe next level allow crystal pools L.
