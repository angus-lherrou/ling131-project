off the air is fascinating is they're really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump someone from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of a sudden he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a those guys to people will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today doesn't the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again\nUm there was another ... a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is I think so now it's in the new democratic\n... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that they this what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who is the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said\nHolder comments were bad that's her phrase that was being criticized writing but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility you paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to a lot of times\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least tried\nTo hide it this\nSwitch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after\nThem several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nParty and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the ... that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung\nBack and they ... they would have followed Malcolm X.\nThings might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nYou back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant now that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either\nThey're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right and I and everyone would ... say that that is her effect um but you know it was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there was ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was

engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump ...\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh if that will be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth team midterms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats there'll be out partying the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTune generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people are being asked well how can this this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much ...\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is gonna be\n\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no\nThe wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the majority in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seats if they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's\nAnd it goes state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this was a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls which say that's exactly what's gonna happen but then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now\n... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanting to murder of thousands\nNobody can\nGet the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy on hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars ending and people will start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find in theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a it's a\nProcedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but it is exceptionally\nWell done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the womb that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh for even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so\nWhen I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just eat let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left abortion is\nNot even human and some Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with this deem Kane is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays\nA gazelle himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings and for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's player for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just wanted to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story about the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and star even Searcy or directing\nThe film [noise] um [noise] [noise]\nI ... I it it it's it's powerfully done and it opens than I Am if if you don't know about ... guys now if you've not heard the name of it doesn't ring a bell you by all means should see this if you do know who guys mail is and if you think you know the story\nBut the cemetery in Columbia last year has been found guilty of numerous charges after several hours of deliberation yesterday a jury found James cast are guilty of six counts of assault and battery but a quid him of murder charges\nAfter the incident which was that the funeral of a state mental health worker caster admitted he was obsessed with seeking vengeance against the south Carolina department of mental health\nA recent report from the Nuclear Regulatory commission says Westinghouse violated atomic standards and that led to Ukrainian leak from the bluff wrote facility\nThey say workers at the facility walked across the plastic liner that was put in place to keep toxic uranium from leaking that they say we can the line or that covered the plants floor and a uranium solution ended up making its way through the line or eating a hole in the plant floor and seeping into the ground below\nThe enter the says Westinghouse was not doing maintenance inspections correctly or adequately I'm Alisa Z news radio five sixty WBRC\nHey you're Jonathan Rauch Kelly mash rash law well South Carolina's ...
