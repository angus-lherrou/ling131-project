the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday Tom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of the here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\n\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding if there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one is seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project I pick up a twenty five states twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nAnd all of her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new

to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something to do it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it\nThat way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around what does it make a lot of sense\nFor a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more politically it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to some men to it like that Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and\nAnd you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and Brennan ... it's all deep state and this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for prison\nThe campaign of two thousand and eight with science thing iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because you can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republican\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts been fixed dinner I get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner empathy and\nSeparate it was really reach plans to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time tell ya I gave my idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan and it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush he taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidence is\nAnd there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who is quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she shouted at I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy care steer but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good speech here's the theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them\nThis is a this\nIs a philosophy that I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you said it is they're all deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the midterms when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory try to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle in working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it
