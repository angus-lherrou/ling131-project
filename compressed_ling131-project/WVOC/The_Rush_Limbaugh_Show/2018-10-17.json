nose up but they didn't care because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one since Obama was enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats\nAs we discussed in great detail yesterday and ... came to me today you said you know what\nYou don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch\nStory I said you mean about ... said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nEntire intelligence community excuse\nStory\nOr having evidence of how to show he died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have to pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that Jamal ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession is fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate wife by network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time they're right but if you're a watch learned was a wife and I work like at your home\nThat your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together\nBut only if you have entered that why find networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first one I mean that's how obscure a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just blew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware you say well you should be aware because they're mad at you know\nNobody's most of the day they say to show he was recorded the events that have to record on watching baseball say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this show should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than the door yeah I'm\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and election ringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill hammer sounded Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right so\nSee I got rid of Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done a Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and I said well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my ... before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nIdle scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact of\nThe election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the cabinet scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\n\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren folk honest thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned and shot where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what ... knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\n[noise] you'd think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't\nA deadlock if the blue wave for a while you still hear me [noise]\nOh yeah I got a couple of stories Democrats are upset whereas Obama they're asking worst Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find Obama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because the blue wave is not a lock and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary two thousand sixteen remember how he did\nIt do you want a third term of mud ... if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened\n... Trump wasn't match it laid it not Hillary Rodham run them\nAnd so he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why\nTrump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they\nTell about it here's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview the wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those\nYou know they're always a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismissed suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses or beauty outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of impact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nCan I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a pie he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one hey\nPete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans want to lose control of the house and a ... or a couple of days later\nDepending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no\nI think I'm helping people look I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about but many of those\nBut you ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you of ideas that that's the way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nWhat some of those but there's so much this information being put out that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour of [noise] I don't go to it and I thought social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy and the history of our country and it's not being reported or you go\nIt's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not going to stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated than it is CNN's media media whatever\nGuys still Marge talking residents just didn't do much media there's too much he's gotta he's gotta stop point loaning the country and so they're so frustrated they can't stop it [noise]\nIn the W ... senior center ... says he believes in Florence say the man accused of the seven officers killing one earlier this month\nHad more than a hundred and twenty guns in his home investigator safe Frederick Hopkins barricaded himself in the upper floor of the home he shared with his adult son deputies arrived ... pre arranged interview with that sun\n...

Don rollers wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at any\nMoment they're going to be talking it up before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they are hoping that the great on washed up near\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that\nPort handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree\nOr another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically his\nBosses at the department of justice and to Congress\nIt was an early warning systems or emergency services warning so we know we saw it immediately it was down and the only thing we can think of was that I blow it out with the energy level here of the content of the program and re re booted it were up and running now\nSo the downtime was minimal\nSorry for that if it affected you hear is Tom in Morris county New Jersey we had to the phones readings a great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I had two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven\nAnyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and yes and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair\nAnd my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not getting a learnt preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said an observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even\nTry to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not any more it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really you you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read chore\nAudio ... that he that he doesn't range but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea they hire a newscast and they\nWhy do you think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThere but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up or might never seen anything\nMy point is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\nAnd take a break for that has to have much to say Russia's probably by being met for Columbia's morning news we dated six to nine\nW.

Washington\nMini series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing how\nHonest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump\nOr Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspapers one of them's being one of them small one of them is\nVery curious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHas to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that had me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate\nThat nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs latte if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about\nThat and it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching

things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he

think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now hire a van or tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here\nDemocrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to wind up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote at this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork yeah was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been a Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nCrumbled a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive buys are fully aware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is\nGet it out there to keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they're on the tenth of a sudden\n[noise] well I you know I Try not to do much

question I continue to get emails about the [noise]\nThe so called Washington Post journalist or jump off your shoulders [noise] my\nQuestion is a really rather simple one where was this concern for our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid to what\nHas it been confirmed as something happened since this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed\nNot concerned so much Bill White clay or thought to end the story is that it took him seven\nMinutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out\nAnd then they listen to music while they did all of this and of course\nUntil I blew up the theory and at the apple watch containing the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like proof existed in the form of audio recordings to show ... knew what was in store for him and it\nGoes apple washing the recording this stuff and it was somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely because of it\nBeing technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing shall we even knew to do or how to do\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in bend gossipy\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustration is is anybody see a a disparity here in proportion\nNow of course we all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for his CNN all afternoon\nHas tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable a graphics that they were using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is to people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had to hold two doors did you know
