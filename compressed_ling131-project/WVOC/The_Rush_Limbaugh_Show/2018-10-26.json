what is this site can't tell what the site is it it's um [noise]\nAny weight identified as soon as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh\nThe window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon\nThey don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also all Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate of a blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit\nAlthough none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this is everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on and until a law enforcement\nSays what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is that this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive by as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters\nOf same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is\nIt didn't come in at the to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also all those alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in and saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nAnd what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's ... get a ride along jobs are still being created everything's about three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still trouble getting right along with the Dr wiser reporting today that it has slowed down there could be trouble on the

whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about how you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there is no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to eight seats in the house or are
