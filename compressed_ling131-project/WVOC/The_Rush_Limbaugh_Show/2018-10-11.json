the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin ... is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know each wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dined Facebook guys spend a lotta time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of

past summer\nShe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father ... king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power\nAway from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont despite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family because of

planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's upset about the country's direction\nNow do you think this guy is going to vote for this guy is obviously going to

that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promise to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that they're ... but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the non last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was this is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if\nIt's the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same ... and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing in a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both\nThe right loses when were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it well that that's\nTrue too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working that's for rats lying\nYup threat flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works is if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed the only really what's going to win in a landslide\nThey know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans of conservative stand up when every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engage like you saw I was\nI was

[laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take\nA bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it flies in the face\nOf the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking our\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to Trump but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama's was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm\nPaying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think defense is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing\nWhat Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nLeftists as they are at many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of Trump\nSo Trump calling\nThem out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election was why things down\nSo they react to it and and there's rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am a not at all with us and we'd them out slowly but surely\nThe war on man I'm I'm so fired up I Want everyone to feel that way um I Am so committed to doing everything I can to expose this I'm I'm inviting all my friends that let's see GM [laughter] throughout the week and at the weekend we are going to get together and we're going to talk\nOf I feel like you can't rely on the mainstream media to do any of that for you and I feel like that's the only reason why the less

Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes in we counted the votes\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite

at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide than my the soundbite would be on the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat an upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed

Sorry\n[noise] yeah I'm I made the same point I when I heard they don't drunk and ... call me exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they had pulled required her to win for them to stay employed in front of the tricks and pulled on Trump\nTo remain
