believe and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is not a single thing in a decent unjust country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants\nA stamp of approval of winning elections yet they win them within their closely contained bases districts and states their enclaves which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and and the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but at some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with the leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America they have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\n\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nObama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years you've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what\nClimate change was going to cost you renting it he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexander ... who's lunacy on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding\nBut the left once every body to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this\nEvery thing they want everything\nThey have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what did they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant

think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue color class and they're now they're now trying their hand

come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this month just common for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone

going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election uh Democrats think the whole country is because if they really\nDon't they know they don't have enough

that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right\nAnd there are some people saying that this is going to be

place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert\nAsked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do

hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\n\nThe Democrats just right now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole your watching for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just reached and at the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is right probably there's Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me\nAnd if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if
