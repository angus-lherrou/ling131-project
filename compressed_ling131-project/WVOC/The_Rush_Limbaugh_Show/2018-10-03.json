B. I.\nSpecial agent her best friend for a wife\n\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement to ABC I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed a credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this\nOr through this with out\nAny any challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such as the the and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech patterns I look you know I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast\nSpecialist vocal work\nA voice capabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again aren't that many gotten it out of there that time we'll see are a specially of mine\nI recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe\nCame down on this woman on mercilessly\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... anybody personal ... perhaps the flag mind about half an hour\nThat's how I found an hour and he even knew\nAll talk and talk on the ground and right now and I found I found ... to curb county\n[noise]\nHow her a car I get a B even now I'm back [noise]\nAnd [noise] yes that's correct a day and then I have some ... ... ... ...

of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but\nThey've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with ... this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out their big claim he's mocking balls e forty wasn't mocking or what\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only so I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it\nTo everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nIf it's deserved even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is playing out\nFlaws in her story which should happen\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't smart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nAn odd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rent them for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't\nStep in it it may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one you know John John Adams has been investigating the prompt for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report\nAnybody want to take a guess what did you say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York just or I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bad yet they want in Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story year long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a potent storage Trump\nWas it Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russian Russian names answer big fat ... zeroes NATO So now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump and he got rich from his dad\nI've actually or whatever is on somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\nA bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nHey you never know what you know when you're grabbing gotta do to try to buy like what you're going to come up with what you're gonna you're gonna come up with the women have\nGreater ... not a Democrat and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted or a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman\nCassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wages that can answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protesters no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for west\nSo\nWhat does this ... unless\nSomebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them\nYou can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media [noise] you know I I told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought they were really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these

holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is not mocking\nChristine balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case soccer balls e for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and I was taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there had been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at the moon\nTo the right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans\nHaven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something and he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you\nHow the lions Lee insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was the was the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump\nDidn't he just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized for the express purpose\nOf destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me to\n...\nMillion women or nor do there should we do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\nWomen are a minority\nThe uh supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party is and so that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that ...\n\nSouth Carolina families are closer

politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution or\nThe written Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something could be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can\nCombine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\n\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms\nAnd becomes legitimate sick ... ... it in in many not that Pacific way but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target as America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it\nDid happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case to be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with\nBlack lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop is a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the\nDemocratic Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocked she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nAnd here it is they do is they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump termed an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right you can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little Shay and for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ab ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you

I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nGet away ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nBelieve she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers and it's not random it's\nI'd spread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine [noise]\nGod if not better right by the way here's this you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats

a rally last night when he appeared to mock Christine Ford who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in high school\nTo get rid of Donald Trump to overthrow the election results of two thousand sixteen and I think Christine balls the Ford\nIs an element of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democratic party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F. B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin or what not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on the lake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know this dismay screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate none of blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats\nBegan smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these three Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski one cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump's sand last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with

line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post

of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not try to serve\nA difficult to convey but this is a text chart there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred in the men the Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid\nEighties and heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties in the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate
