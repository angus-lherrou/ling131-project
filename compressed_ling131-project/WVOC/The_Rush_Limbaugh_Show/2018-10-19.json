Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth say they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues\nThat were twenty four seven for at least two weeks and then no particular order hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristie in Boise for Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then touted as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue\nThat was after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where is he now where\nIs the issue of gun control where is this story that young people high school and college students that had enough and they were going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the direct where\nIs that the day what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\nMy\nPoint is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's Syrian David ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David Hawk doesn't have an audience David ... did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal ... these people do not have connections\nWith an audience they don't have connections with Boehner's like Trump ... like other successful people immediate do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarm that ... where we miss hog we may want to see up nobody's saying where's hog\n\nI'm there's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience ... point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything wrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she wasn't consenting adults jihad Maya ... she was a consenting adults I Know what was\n\nIt not abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nWell bye-bye me to move but\nI mean if the ... that random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy your women\nClaiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good is the me too movement\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without the media\nFanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point\nTrump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain popular\nYesterday to talk about the state's mixed oxide fuel fabrication or mocks program the administration threatened to kill the project the group was there to make their case against that Senator Lindsey Graham said the program's been mismanaged\nAnd South Carolina shouldn't bear the responsibility for that mistake the deal we should uh Columbia official can resume his duties after some disturbing charges were dropped governor McMaster reinstated city councilman mold the door of the district recount someone had been suspended since last year when he was arrested for domestic violence\nVoter registration is up across the state in the four months leading up to this year's registration deadline nearly Ninety One thousand previously unregistered people in the state registered that's about Twenty one hundred more than before the two thousand fourteen mid term elections\nI'm Alisa Z news radio five sixty W.

didn't apply their cell phones cellphone callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way way back that up are you back\nOh I I've been way back before that even so ah but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nAh at it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that got nothing\nIn it it burns me up at all the time\nSo are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... I all I can say these are smarter man than I Am\nA maybe but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and from the Democrats to capitalize on flooding lose own with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump hasn't been on foot wall that Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nI don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump has been banned that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly\nRight when the moon right there that's what's for and the Trump supporters\nThat we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors in the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut many of the ... the ... I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was not to be gone or a before now\nI I they\nAre so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican

time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats to replace Tony on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally abs and um\nAny any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that as a result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixteen I mean that those people were all literally called short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win an old landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms\nIn two thousand fourteen ... election as you've thousands sixteen the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again as everybody's\nTelling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up work up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even trying to be associated\nThey don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a lead the balloon and they died with it so they banned the map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest that trend

Hampshire this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call\nUm I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought it was just great which was probably one of the best show ever hacked\nAnd we're really simple and you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their you know starting a business is you know small businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know and where they are and\nSo yeah yeah you know you don't want that was you know you you what you remember\nThere was a um it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks and white collar employees were being laid off executives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls a ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties\nWhite collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and ask what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another um this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were they were all\nAmazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumpster angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business so I remember I remember it well 'cause there was where he was in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day thing that that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people the people would want but\nUm well don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people that don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do you think that\nPeople need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you as well are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that the way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the the vast majority of of employment in the country and some ... saying the backbone\nWell okay I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone\nAnd not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway man I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have and breaking the law\nYou had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but it it there's not a brick that's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting a member of these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen either done too much into a little\nOh I don't either get and the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what
