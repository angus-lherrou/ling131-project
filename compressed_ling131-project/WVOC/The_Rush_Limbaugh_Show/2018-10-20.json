{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And try to accumulate as much as I can well at some point when you start getting close to retirement you got to pull the blinders off you have to look at the big picture\nAnd that's where we're here to help you do and take all the things you've been working on you've been building\nWhich is so important and so valuable that you've been doing but let's take the four one K. is take the Social Security benefits let's look at the timing of when you want to retire and let's put all those pieces together and build a plan and the foundation of that plan is you're written retirement income plan if you don't have a written retirement income plant or if you haven't looked at in a long time\nI Would urge to give us a call right now at age ... three nine retire we offer you an absolutely no cost new obligation five step retirement review and part of that retirement review is taking a look at your retirement income plan or helping you build your first retirement income plan once again that number's eight oh three\nNine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a tire a call now never first to get a second opinion and if you don't have one yet it's never too late to get started calling out into three nine retire\nTalking today with hats derby he's the founder of preservation specialists and I'm generally jak alongside retire with pat dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more ... what if we like part of our retirement intend to be guaranteed what should we be thinking of that for guaranteed income\nWell certainly I think everyone wants to at least part of a guaranteed rage and so we need to think about what's included in that category\nAnd think of it again as we're looking at your goals were figuring out what's going to cost to accomplish those goals now we're figuring out how we're going to generate the income to cover them so that's going to come from for most people Social Security\nFor some people a pension as well so both of those generally usually have some type of guarantee backing them and then the question is is that enough and for the vast majority of people the answer is no so there's a gap there right so how are we going to cover that gap\nAnd again for most people that's covered by their nest egg\nSo we want to encourage people if you think of the three worlds of money we don't want to cover that gap from the growth money's money in the stock market and mutual funds we want that to be kind of your long term growth money where we want to pull it from the other two areas which is the safe and guaranteed world or the steady income\nBut steady income isn't guaranteed so coming back to your question that leaves the safe guaranteed world\nAnd for most people the idea if there's a gap there and they want to have something guaranteed that we're ... can come in because you know there are a lot of different kinds of annuities but certain kinds of annuities can have tremendous guarantees built in and that can be incredibly valuable in the circumstance\nAnd we do have a little bit of time here before we get to the end of the show so why don't we talk a little bit more about the kinds of annuities and what we should be thinking about when it comes to perhaps using one and our retirement plan\nYeah so there's a lot of different kinds of news out there Jan and it often is considered you know kind of a taboo subject and I often hear there are a number of things in finance where someone might say well I've heard of that term and I know someone that got burned by it or I Know I've seen articles telling me it's a bad idea and I knew what he is a big one\nBecause there is a couple of different kinds of annuities that people have been burned older style annuities sometimes we're what we call irrevocably which means you put your money in and then you all of a sudden you lost total control and that's certainly not the kind of annuity that we would think is appealing today\nOn the other hand there are types of annuities that have tremendous layers of fees in them and there are a lot of people that advertise against annuities these days and that's what they're referring to\nAre a ... that have one or two or three or four layers of fees that my costs three or four or five percent a year to the investor certainly something with such layers of fees is not something there'll be appealing so\nWhat we were talking about is an annuity and for most of our clients what they're looking for something that has some kind of safety of principle so they know they're not taking risk of there\nAnd then the main thing we're really usually looking for Jen is do we have the ability either now or down the road to turn on some kind of guaranteed lifetime income and you know you and I I Believe in the last segment we were talking about what if we live a really long time and the technical term we use for that does longevity risk\nSo if you we live a really long time how do we make sure we never run out of money well one of the few tools that protects you against that is an annuity that offers a guaranteed lifetime income so\nThe way that we use those if you think about a married couple we usually want to have an annuity\nIf it's an appropriate fit for them and not all of our clients certainly use the new it is but if it's a fit for them\nWe want to allocate some money to that safe guaranteed basket of money and it's going to be that I knew they were the principal has a guarantee from the company and then at some point we can turn on income that's gonna be guaranteed for as long as both or at least one of those spouses is living\nAnd that can provide a tremendous amount of comfort knowing that you can't outlive them money\nAnd again ... you know a lot of times I'm meeting with people who are fifty five or sixty and you know we're running projections we're looking at it and you think about when you're eighty eighty five or Ninety and sometimes they'll gonna laugh and say you know that's the least of my worries right now\nWell that's okay but at least a your worries but my job is to make sure you never run out of money right so this isn't something that you are piling all of your money into but what it can be as a piece and that's where it can be an appealing\nOpportunity for you to kind of begin allocating in those three different worlds and having a lifetime income guaranteed to one piece can be very appealing for a lot of people\nApparently have just a couple of minutes left in our show today do you have any final comments you'd like to share with us as we start to wrap things up\nI think you know we were laughing a little bit in the beginning that wouldn't it be nice if we were trying to figure out when can I retire or how much is going to cost me to retire how much do I need to save for retirement shake a magic eight ball and\nTo give us a simple answer but of course life's never that easy as we all love to have an easy button on her desk but that's not the way it works so I think this was a really valuable topic to discuss today helping you figure out the different steps involved and again we really need to make sure we know what your retirement is going to look like what are your goals what are your dreams what's\nYour lifestyle could it be are you a home body are you a world traveler do you want to eat out every night do you want to spend your time volunteering for church for charity course for many people with a mixture of all those things but helping you figure out what that lifestyle is going to look like I mean that's a fun process to really think through\nThen that helps us figure out what that is going to cost and then we can kind of assess what your assets are to help you build that retirement and that's the whole idea is building you a written retirement income plan from the ground up it's personalized and customize specifically just for you\nAnd that can have tremendous power not only could help you retire successfully but I can give you tremendous peace of mind to know that you have a plan in place in the you're on track towards accomplishing those goals so we don't\nAnd like that yet give us a call right now it's a two or three\nNine retired we call our custom built retirement plan because we are accustomed building it for each individual clients and what we're doing is offering that to you is a we call it five steps retirement review it absolutely no cost it no obligation to get started called ... three nine retire\nIf you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a tire a call now and it was three nine retire this analysis is completely customized based on your circumstances there's absolutely no obligation but this offers limited to a source of today's show once again that number's eight oh three nine retire\nYou've been listening to stage your retirement with pat ... make sure you remember that number eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three or eight oh three nine retire\nThe shortage tune in next week for more insights with ...

that journalist ... was killed earlier this month inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nThey didn't even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces\nSo she's one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only envy in DNA so he felt the need doing expanded to include South America when other\nReason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit engine they use genealogical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus us in this country the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that story I get\nIs that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but\nThe the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA\nTest and he wanted to present herb ... hammer take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate\nThe future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and for out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious\nA nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house at a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election they continue\nTo lose even more and the and the damage that lock to weigh in the in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two\nThousand six feet elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they could do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\n\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country had been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party ... on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there's no real Trump hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary and in fact\nThere's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave\nIn two thousand Eighteen\nIs this a CNBC polar survey America is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today\nActual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat equals a roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one\nWith that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the terms\nBased on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying for none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told\nThat the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet there isn't a pivotal\nLincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six game presidential election\nFor those of us shouting at me why but we're we're storing food so we won the popular vote by three ...\nFrom my family county board of elections like five of them from having a fat or something like that so\n[noise] semi soundbites who am I trying to squeeze it in here somebody to so far as I'm thinking man on us of course but but I I'm thinking nothing is chances for rock Obama ruins the Democratic party ... is the reason\nThat they lost well hundreds seats nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that they lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could do\nA mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life of a career in the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court\nNothing is going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it something you'd never Trump person but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what may happen the Democrats attempt on Kavanaugh\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing I'll probably the first standing in his career\nIn front of us or other stadium or arena sized crowd I guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation\nDad he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely by holding steady in this fine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment a cabin on the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's\nIt's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not

teaching students\nIf she does that mean that just [noise] and I guess it's possible\nI guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talked she's you're running around the beach out there uh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled out or whatever\nAh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things\nThe the real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him if they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kevin last thing they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching the most\nPowerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat one warrants such a thing but the Democrats didn't care\nThat there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with\nThe media to create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\nAnd even in their own pulse Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the approval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... and I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it all together and\nIt's in this universe framework contacts I just I don't see this Massey blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it I think they're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got ... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats\nElectoral seats in Washington than they've had since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen\nFor rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party and it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American and check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance\nThey voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could whereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate where is the\nWorst plugs Beto O'Rourke\nHeard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing Beto has told them to go pound sand\nBeto has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raised among yourself I'm going to ... been this way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople will remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was so but leave him he had he wanted\nNo party campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was nice the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coattails and ... is not going to want to share in any of his money\nNot being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points now the latest ... uh not fair that\nBeto has more than he needs and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do\n'em yeah look I also have the

Republican senator Dean Heller\nBut it's it's a British network and the title it's a six episode one hour per episode mini series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not\nAbout contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all\nMade up and it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than the\nFuror trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this\nDoes it's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little taste of it\nWhen I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that had me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that said it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed who is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions\nI'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in and the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it\nWent with it and the president I didn't\nWant to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody is white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much uh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than\nThe entertainer to buy it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr many of the ...\nBarry characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pita files story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not whether recalls that got us a peta I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about me to move out here\nThat would put this thing together so the name of it is ... I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's gets faster because it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] it it's it's hit\nEverybody everybody as a rapid rate including\nThe

ask me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOh okay so why would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why she's saying that well\nBecause she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out that Latinos are far more

democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about this\nNow I don't want to make too much of it that's the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back\nFor Strategic reasons and still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegade that'll bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but we'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi and a ... and nice to have you welcome to the ... network\nLike Mr Mumbai appreciate it this is definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nUm so I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms and not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have\nA thing against Trump and they don't want it to the fight the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term\nWell uh I that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worth\nThere is in in the in the\nQuote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and volunteer department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections\nMean call me even five at this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it out I Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact opposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is all I'm telling you is that there is\nThis it may even be a written regulations for all I Know but I I Am for certain that it is\nAnd acknowledge gentleman late procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales of justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases that I had to exonerate heard their futures dependent on it\nTheir careers dependent on it and she was a democratic nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again as seizing the unwritten regulation not impacting the elections so it does exist and it probably is a factor in callers report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to\nNot have to\nParaphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this was going to drive the left literally batty\nThat it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian style\nTurned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we know it showed affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not\nWhat about you play the game let's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on Mahler to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what\nDo you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything any on obstruction because folks at one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "20"}
