couldn't think of their lives have been more and\nAll four of them are just raided damaging October surprise backfires from the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted twenty different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a Dennis ... of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA\nDr Carlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true issues and ending you got one one thousand twenty fourth and there wasn't even any Indian or Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to\nEvidence laughable it is the static and I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton was making a fool of herself each and every day out there saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica limit no no no no no not was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making the answer herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's under cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be embarking on what a stadium chore or yes bill\nAnd Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged white is I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going\nTo say there's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it and I'm Talking about this it type of charisma\nBack in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly you know for the first term maybe he had I've never really they are I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near the wake of\nDonald Trump

supplant take over\nThis program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally they're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush to enough rabbit\nThe crabs out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you Hillary Clinton couldn't draw fly just do a book selling\nParty she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact bus people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the

hasn't turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with and it was it a central\nPart of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\n\nI'm Still shocked and balls showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing that was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd\nDoes anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just [noise] and I\nGuess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how if you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talk she's you're running around the beach out there uh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed her yelled out or whatever\nUh\nAnyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they had been able to do that\nGet Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly and then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people\nIn the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always ... all the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse than poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I I'm telling you that they are\nTeetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's in this universe framework contacts I just\n\nI don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it I think they're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today is sharing how I break this down using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them up Democrats having fewer seats electoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSinglehandedly\nMade this happen rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American you check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect to the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing bet do has told them\nTo go pound sand that tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raise the money yourself I'm going to ... been this way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold Whitney him\nHe had he wanted no part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was but nice the office of the presidency to go that low\nReal reason he didn't want to do with his Obama didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who is by the way what does he down seven or eight points in our latest ... uh it's\nNot fair that Beto has more than he needs and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do\n'em yeah look I also have the um the ... situation and there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr ... let me just tell you what the drive by purpose here is\nAgain the drive buyers are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to ... murder might away just so you know there are a couple a CNN\nPoll major pronouncing your name could show gee\nBecause there's two genes in there every time I've heard the word the name pronounce it's always been ... ad ... pronounce his name that way Robin Leach who made a star out of ab ... is Yogi who was a Saudi arms merchant\nAnd he was practically featured every other week and the lifestyles of the rich and famous\nHis name was pronounced ...
