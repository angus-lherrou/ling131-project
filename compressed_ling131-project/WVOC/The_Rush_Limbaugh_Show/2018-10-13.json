Franklin I think for Florida yeah it's a tough task because you go in and you get a big win and you're going into a place that psychologically think\nAutomatically you should win\nBut but Derek Franklin this and a great job defensively there they have a potential NFL quarterback and Schumer I'm as a trap game if there was ever was a trap game that's the trap\nGame or Florida well the gators are struggling so far again fourteenth rank Florida currently trailing van de ... changes three just to film school so far the gators they are on the board we'll see if Florida can follow up on that big victory against LSU with a win against the Commodore it's tough stretch for vanity by the way the Commodore ... playing at second rang Georgia last\nWeek they play Florida at home this week they go to Eighteenth rank Kentucky next Saturday nights now for a look at the wild wild SEC west our friend Wayne Smith is joining us from our eye heart radio stations in Birmingham and wait for those who believe\nThat the dogs have been bored by their early games a lot of people think they have Georgia the second ranking of the nation starting a brutal secondhand schedule they travel to thirteenth ranked LSU this afternoon\nYeah this is the game that we are going to learn a lot about Georgia we've learned that\nLSU is not quite the team everyone thought they were going to be there were five and going into that game last week they fought to Florida and ... they're going to come back down to earth because they're going to play Georgia and I expect Georgia to win no matter what it's about how much will tell us if Georgia is for real they should be the\nNumber two team in the country that they should be the one I wouldn't be in the SEC with Alabama\nTheir average and forty three points again they're given up Thirteen great numbers but can they keep that up against they deep and it's like LSU that'll tell us a lot I think Georgia wins I think the run game succeeds\nWhat I'm looking at the most is how does that deep in the attack the all the decline of Georgia they're banged up a little bit they've got one guy down one guy hobbled can they continue to play the way they play and so forth through the season\nI Know you're Holyfield looked good Jay from is that a pretty good year so far twelve hundred yards touchdown to picks\nA can they keep up the alternative so they win the game big\nWill Jake Brahms certainly look good last week against dandy but a much different cast this afternoon and the by your first meeting by the way between the bulldogs in the tigers in Baton Rouge since two thousand eight and ... you gotta think based on what happened last week in the swamp the LSU defense now with their backs against the wall\nThey've got to feel like they have to win this game\nOh they absolutely feel like they have to win this game this afternoon and the thing for a less you eat is apt to continue to do what you're doing because they'll issues ...\nOutside of the interceptions from Joe borough really didn't get the beat and it was at the end of the game with those interceptions came\nThey were playing the kind of all they're going to play all year long he's going to gain manager Joe borough neighbors that can an average of your yard that carries got six hundred yards and the the than an eighties easiest to steady back there is no huge play maker on this thought that\nAre going to win with solid defense and just scored ... points so that the defense can hold on their only average in thirty one point the game you're not going to see a shootout number from LSU in this ball game\nOr a number to Georgia traveling to Thirteen drink LSU that game today at three thirty on CBS tonight I'm a zoo team that's got to be a little bit shell shocked after losing here last Saturday now they go to number one Alabama way that is not exactly the antidote for a locker room full of broken hearts\n[laughter] that's not the way to get over anyway ... is to go to Alabama this is not going to be a ball game I Know people are worried Alabama gave up thirty one points to Arkansas but\nThere's always a but to that to kind of a low it continues to shine the album often continues to shine they\nStill won the game by thirty four points in doubled up Arkansas who showed a lot of wherever though I was actually very proud of that Arkansas theme for the way they played that ball game and they still gave up sixty four points\nSo if you look at this game Missouri comes in with an off and that can be good Emanuel halls hobbled up though who is the best receiver on that team is the best pro prospect they've got a wide receiver\nAnd drew locks and a half to find some other weapons on the outside he's going to have to look at going to maybe the running back out of the backfield in around tree I I\nAnd nobody can fine but he's going to have to be able to do something because Alabama can play a lot more dined defenses what which is where they've excelled this season when they don't have to rely on the line backers in the middle and they can play more guys in the secondary\nLine backers got torch last week in Arkansas and the new does doesn't line up that way to play in our fence to take on the line backing witnesses\nThe tigers definitely have some fixes to make in their red zone often they'll play at number one Alabama tonight\nAt seven on ESPN weight Smith is with us the sport's director or I heart radio stations\nIn Birmingham weight also tonight Arkansas plays its annual game in Little Rock that's where old miss will face the razorbacks as you mentioned Arkansas showing some moxie last week against Alabama the razorbacks are feeling a little more confident they think they can run on the rebels but\nThe question is can Arkansas stop to ... and the oldest passing attack\nThis game I ended up being something like fifty six fifty three with away Arkansas played last week\nThey just need to take the tape but the second half from Alabama and only do that Mr action screens of the diet and screen to the running back let Ole Miss over pursue because it's dark and talked and\nDoesn't have a ton of play making ability on it but what they do have the ability to be consistent and to catch people off guard because they were actually fairly disciplined they were just getting out athlete it against Alabama that's why they were able to drive the ball I I was very impressed with a ... boy the the guy from last chance you now at Arkansas\nHe played a very good game against Alabama that's a nice play it all season long which if you're best game got the Alabama that's an NFL date I don't care about thirty one point last thirty four point loss or what\nThat's just a great game now all men\nThey just got to come out score they know that if it's going to give up point you've got to forty two points per game season average you need a score in the fifties when this game to guarantee winning this game and I think they do get it but it's going to be an ugly authentic game there's going to be so many points scored on both sides\nBoth sides need conference victories they would be a first this season for either the rebels were the razorbacks Arkansas has won four straight in the series\n... would love to add to that when strict the razorbacks taking this with the Little Rock tonight that's where the Faisal miss at seven thirty in the SEC Network way thank you very much that's a look at the wild wild SEC western thanks to wait Smith sportswriter for I heard media\nIn Birmingham by the way Eighteenth rank

the Aggies play last Saturday I mention this in the last segment of the vote to win over Kentucky to things we learn\nOnce they control the football the balanced often she would just referring to a running in passing and they don't give you many chances they average over thirty five minutes of possession dynamic game a which is always a ... step right there so this game type defense were just talking about needing to play a full four quarters\nThis is still awfully thin on the defense in a team if Texas a and them to control the football like that today that could be a problem\nOh absolutely I mean I I don't I don't think there's any question the because we have not played well but uh uh a few times this year\nBut we're going to have to play really well on both sides and football like we always talk you know if you're going to keep up a possession team from possessing the ball you're off in ... needs to move the ball and ... and not only score but changed feel position eat clock\nOr things like that but it it's it for a a defense that's been bludgeoned by a number of people um it's a real challenge for us today and you know like we talked about earlier they're going to have to become that opportunistic deep bench just creates turnovers\nAnd um makes big plays it inside the red zone but I don't see any way in the world that we're going to stop them or contain them I think it's gonna be managing what they do off internally and again us having a really good off into day throwing a football run into football which\nWe we've not run the football with the exception to Vanderbilt all year long\nRight it would it be fair to say based on what you just said that the up tempo often might not come into play too much today for the games I mean you can't afford to many quickly announced against ...\nYou know it hasn't been highly successful in my opinion you know I Know that's what they want to do and strive to be and all that sort of thing but you're right they need to eat some clock you know they need to\nHave some time possession themselves because like you pointed out if we do the three in out three in out bring it out and they're all in complete passes and the clocks stop and we ate maybe thirty seconds for a minute off of the clock is going to be ugly\n[noise] the other thing we learned about the Aggies last week is that well they are the FCC's best team against the rush for a reason\nI mean ... who ran and ran and ran when when you play the game talks in pretty much everybody else's these and did not do that against this am defense and we just talked about aging Turner being out because of the concussion or you've got to at least try to establish some semblance of running game today and how do you do that\nWell I I think it's going to be much like it was last week you know we we kept hands on the ball off you know ... it looked like it was the same play over and over again or and gaining two yards maybe three yards\nUm and then we need to be a little bit imaginative on officers farce maybe getting on the corners on and maybe some deception maybe a trick player too but yeah we're going to have to keep them off balance because they\nI'd say of in Alabama and LSU they have the best deepest a front in the SCC and they're hard to run the ball against and if you pass pass pass pass pass\nAnd they have an opportunity just to disregard the run it's going to be a bad day for Bentley a scar neck you or anybody is back there so we're going to have to stick with some running game even if it's unsuccessful\nIn when they turn around now you're down to basically you know the two two running backs up back there to get those touches for the game talks but Jeannette maybe be a good thing I mean do you think that sometimes when you're you're sitting there are three guys moving a minute out nobody gets a chance to to to to get a rhythm going here and maybe it's better to have two guys are not three\nI've always heard that Gary I've always that great running backs and and people that talk about great running backs they would always say\nYou know they need Fifteen twenty carries and the more carries the get the more they get into the flow and when you're doing it or by committee\nAnd you're splitting twenty carries between three guys I don't think any one guy gets an opportunity to to get a handle um but yeah they they need to be a effective in some way whether it's Tom possession or whether it's moving to change or whether it's actually scorn 'em by running the football\nThe Yankees

start but understands why theloop quarterback Jake Bentley sometimes struggles with success\nI don't think it has anything to do with his decision making him his level of plays a Cuban I think sometimes it's just how it happens both sometimes get dropped balls sometimes get intercepted that you know that shouldn't be intercepted or should be intercepted and you know sometimes it's just the luck of the draw I wouldn't knock his level of play I Would just say sometimes it just doesn't go right\n... through for two hundred and forty nine yards three touchdowns no interceptions we'll see if he takes any saps before today's game in but it will be Bentley as we've been told it will start when the game ... twenty second ranked Texas A M a three thirty kick off on the SEC Network\nOf course for Johnson along with John at the rental sorry Jonathan here is the million dollar question is there a way to use Skurnick today\nWithout impacting the confidence of ...\nNo ... no ... in all honesty because here's the deal a will my ship is thrown his lot\nBehind Jake mentally and I think if you're Michael ...\nThe only way that you come into the game as if Jake Bentley is not performing up to the level the coaching staff the fan base a expects them to perform so for Michael ... to come into the game that means either Jake building has been injured or Jake Billy is not being the quarter back to you want him to be so\nNo I mean it in in all honesty I think if I were will ... I Would have had Jake\nBilly coming in in a backup role because Jake believes coming it often injury is coming in off all week knee right now which means your mobility is somewhat limited yeah he'll be wearing a knee brace today and over the foreseeable future he's going to be wearing a knee brace and you look at what Michael Skurnick heated last week it was very efficient nobody knew about micro screen Nikki unless you came to some\nMaybe spring practice open game that was\nA at Williams rice said him where he has just had a chance to see what he is as a quarterback for Jake belly to come in\nIn this scenario off ... off a game where you sat out and Michael ... came in late very efficient made great passes got your wide receivers involved as the game and here's the deal let's not forget Michael ... South Carolina and the game winning drive\nAnd the pivotal game in the season under the most unusual circumstances that most games got fans have never seen you've never seen again could gain at Williams rice sitting and that was shut down for hours\nAnd then Michael Skurnick you came in in the back into that game and lead you put your position for a game winning feel go kick in his first start ever as a senior it's unprecedented\nYeah there is no doubt you I mean you can discount the opponent Missouri not the strongest team in the league but conditions and everything else ... was impacting that was certainly a\n... yeah I don't care if it's coastal Carolina Georgia son or whatever\nIf you've never played before in meaningful minutes in a college football game\nThat's a tough situation to be in and Michael ... thank you not only perform admirably but he performed at a very high level\nOf winning and he puts you in that position to win that football game in the SEC like the discussion this week is much different if Michael ... last week right so for for will must ship to annoy Jake belly and in part of me understands because\nReally has been your guy he's been the face of the program if you bought an ass on magazine the beginning of the year you've seen Jake bellies face\nOn that magazine but here's here's the deal\nA Michael Skurnick you won you that football game last week and Jake nearly has not been that quarterback those far so for will much champ put him in the position to start a football game I guess the team who is very very good against Iran which means they're going to be on the past\n... really has not been very good against past events as this far this year despite a plethora of all kinds of weapons\nI think it really in hindsight if you're moving much champ you look at the situation and in essence you said Jake belly up not only to fail but fail in a grand scheme unless he pay plays the best football of his career\nAnd we're going to certainly explore that topic more that is going to be the major\nStory points going into today's game with Texas said in a lot more and this afternoon game across the street in a moment first let's check out the big highlight reel brought to us by big boy cards the game gotcha whether to a sunny starch and then a soggy ending to get a third straight widow over Missouri last Saturday\nBackers getting to a girl and then nothing else was nothing\nBut ... and early blender a big win a failed on side kicked they gave the game ... a great deal and then a combination of Caroline is to give me the receivers don't starting quarterback Michael ... tied the game\n\nYard starting [noise]\nTaught [noise]\nDealers or with a goal in the ass networked with the tigers washing attack ... finding holes leading do another misery touched down to the ... been a ... to start the second quarter with Carolina already trailing Seventeen to seven ...\nBack one two punch with just the two of his talented receivers [laughter]\nA yard sign ... tackle\nIn the twenties [laughter] [noise]\nWhite extra point closing the gap just Seventeen were seen but at the end would add to more fuel goals that increasing the zoos lead to twenty three fourteen\nRains starting to soak the field during halftime but the game ... out of the locker room firing despite the wet weather first ... score then or white additive people go on ... at its worst leader today and his reign continue to pour down talented ... quarterback through lock made a big mistake\nA new six plus the point after ... you're on a U.S thirty one twenty three advantage heading into the fourth quarter but that's where things really got great because we had\n... plus a one hour ... minutes lightning delay at the end just moments after Tacoma can hit I Believe it's set in your field all the final three minutes\nIn Missoula one point advantage\nGirl and as cool as a cucumber quarterbacks set up your line is the goal kicker for the victory\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBrian is worth it [noise]\nAnd that lead would hold up for the remaining two seconds the goal courtesy the SEC Network as the game ... got some ... performances to beat Missouri's thirty seven thirty five year old and a third straight win over the tigers and that's a look back\nAt the game packs last game the big highlight reel brought to us by big boy carts well let's check out some of the early game scores in progress will set you back to a game control and Rob Sanders\nTells a couple of games that I'm following over here include the Vanderbilt game with Florida and they had a targeting penalty both ... met over there in near the player\nAnd just kind of chaos up at Vanderbilt right now as they head into the half Vanderbilt has a Twenty one is Thirteen lead also just under way in the third quarter\nNumbers Twenty one Auburn leads Seventeen to Thirteen over Tennessee at Ohio State has a Seventeen to fourteen lead as they start to third quarter over\nMinnesota okay Rob thank you very much and we'll continue to keep an eye on a busy day and some interesting scores coming in\nSo far this afternoon well chicken now with former ... quarterback Steve Jenny Hill joins state we were just talking about it in fact we've been talking about it around the last couple of days what gutsy first start by Michael ... better than you expect\nThere is ... and there probably should be you know when you're born to a with a a ... a very controversial I think about three touchdowns in Alabama I think most of 'em but we're at a party a porn or the year where\nThis is what you're supposed to be [noise] and now we're going to find out if there really is a difference in the same thing because like you mentioned the over the last five years you just there there was the second half collapse second season I Am a falter and you know we start the second half today and uh uh the three the last game\nAgainst South Carolina have all been very highly contested even though I Am one could have gone either way and I think is going to be the same kind of then\nThere's ... thanks filled different because there's a different man in charge there is no question about that you still got to go out and do it and they're still the if if you listen to a in a press conference the players were still peppered with questions about what's different now what's different is the guy\nIn charge jumbo Fisher you also look at the west is more attainable right now you know of any of them can get by and it's going to be a tricky game today there's no doubt about it but if a an empty get by South Carolina\nWould then have two weeks to pair prayer for a trip to start building the cow bells and that's always difficult but they're very one dimensional\nAnd a and M. as in their dimension that they like to operate out up is the dimension a and M. shutting down the opponent in ... and ... with a lookout clunky there they may lose to date it to the sea so it's attainable right now it really is but you got to go out to be a pretty good South Carolina today\nGay Bach at all and Buchanan from ... radio with us again you mention what jumbo fishers brought in terms of a different feeling to this program and all and touched on the fact that the losses Alabama to clubs and those are the two best teams in the nation in the last few years so is ... ahead of schedule so far\nWhat do you think oh I think I think he is a lot of ways I think he is in the uh in the culture establishment and the complete immediate by and especially if his leaders you know when he got in on the face of the ... and that was there was a lot of love and there aren't that robots and came back to what goes my father I\nThink the culture is being established in a big white or go find out is immediately they're still able to close down the stretch in his first year but there are six games we thought they'd be foreign to but I'm more courage than this foreign do\nThen to foreign to I was predicting going into the start of the year ... yet\nLook does it feel different yeah it does it look a little different absolutely but the fact of the matter is that's what I was trying to get at an earlier fact of the matter is\nWe expect them to be bored to death for now we know that Kentucky was going to be as good as the war and so maybe you know they weren't didn't know Kentucky bluegrass rank number Thirteen and so that looks like a really good when now but the bottom line is\nLook there two years ago and it was number or maybe it's three years ago I think it was two years ago was number four in the country and the first a ... a playoff sixty drawing to a\nA Mississippi State which was struggling and and just last three of the last four so we think everything's looks a lot better we feel like everything's better\nBut they still got to prove it and it's thought that that that process approving it starts today this season\nDefining stretch isn't playing to the first to the\nWild things ranked one or two in the first four games of the year that was the season defining stretch season defining stretch began last week he gets a very good and darned complete Kentucky team and a lot of ways a few holes everybody does but it started there and it was that for game ... Kentucky at home and then ... back to back\nTo back road games this is round two of a season defining stretch this stretch won't define GMO fishers tenure\nHe's still building the soccer twenty Eighteen isn't even really about twenty Eighteen but in a lot of ways while you're building a thing and it still has a chance to finish second in the S. C. west in the middle of the building and construction process right now so that's very encouraging round to do of the the season twenty Eighteen defining moment right now as around to\nSee how it goes this afternoon ... radio represented by a box and my only Buchanan on your the resident Heisman voters do you take a regional approach it tell us who you're looking at it from the SEC right now who's jumping out of ...\nYou know I think ... me and I love animals is going to say to a ... he got it how about a ... and and quite frankly I think it's already has to lose Haskins at Ohio State to have some great things but\nYou know that was the guy had like Eighteen touchdown passes and something like twenty four and completion twenty five completely it's crazy I hadn't played in the third or the fourth quarter all year oh and by the way the quarterback of the number one team of the country so yeah I think you start with him\nUm you know quite frankly I think that that\nIf things go well he's not going to win it but maybe Trayvon Williams obeying him could actually get to the discussion he's having a big year yeah um I thought at the beginning of the year that they Fitzgerald who's going to be a a Heisman candidate but you know with the way things have gone to Mississippi say that just you know obviously that's not happening\nTell us a little bit about what this rivalry looks like from where you are and kind of out of the bottom ... yes exactly which nobody knew existed until a week\nYou know they will bust him do it happened and I was I wanted to say it's been a one sided view of course are I'll never\nForget the ... game five eleven you mentioned twenty fourteen and in South Carolina you know the five eleven game in in a and M. ran the football around the clock out in the last ten minutes the first game you know two years ago a completely different story in South Carolina had settled on Jacob because he was a true freshman she still had the brand and Mack Swain factor\nAnd I want to say to made a change I guess that was true overnight coming in here and that was a tie game you could see the improvement it was very early\nIn the bus champ here and then last year was tight no ... on a team last year South Carolina I'm a ... ... four times and the fourth quarter alone last year it doesn't feel like a rivalry necessarily pose a kind of a made up like yoga you guys are not going to be rivals it never played once before but I like it\nI'd rather I'd rather be here than maybe your actions in\nColumbia showed up\nYeah no doubt I yeah I don't think that and it looks the\nBans typically look at at at South Carolina as a rival but they look at it you know there's a respect their um there's no reason to this ... South Carolina there's a reason to build any ... uh animosity there's there's a certain amount with a\nA coach must champ yeah he wants to disparage college the right to so that you know they they've had a perfectly with a A N and plans but as far as uh\nSouth Carolina you know they just look at it as another good opponent got labor\nTo make Harvey bowl today that that's right or be used to play at Texas a and M. now here a couple of guys from the Lone Star state you were inactive for today but the Harvey's the balloon guy who might\nBe see the playing field before things get said and done this afternoon guys great to see I enjoy I enjoy the trip rich groceries that was All right thank you so much for having us again that's ... you can't it protects acts radio guys enjoy it and will certainly look for your work on the website as you do great work not only\nOn the Aggies but on the SEC is a whole perfect thank you so much ... thank you guys as we continue to study this Carolina match up with Texas A M let's talk for a moment about what the Aggies will bring to the program and bring to the table today and it's certainly we'll start with will run game Trayvon Williams a as just mentioned is an extreme force as far as\nThe Aggies go and he's been a force\nThroughout the SEC all\nSeason long and the game ... with their struggles so far and stopping the run that's going to be one of the key as we can still continue to study this matchup let's chicken once again with ... now reporters round table it's brought you buy\nCarolina pool tables plus recovers the Aggies for the Houston Chronicle and Brent lettuce start at the top ... what are the differences we just heard a little bit from Gabe in oil and about ... covering a Kevin someone team and then you're covering\nA very different jumbo Fisher program I give us some of the uh some idea of what the differences are between covering these programs on this program a certainly get two very different\nMen at the top of the list and similar in a very different for said very different presidents for the for the Aggies then\nAre we having trouble could we're having trouble connecting with Brent tournament we'll ... we'll check back in with Brent in just a moment in fact let's take a timeout when we come back we'll check in with Britain tournament was going to join us ... on the phone in just a moment from the Houston Chronicle we'll do our reporters ... round table and we'll talk coach Eric Wilson as well\nAs our best game got coverage continues Texas a and M. and South Carolina coming up at three thirty on the SEC Network apple continue with more just a moment\nThough again cause reporters mounted daughter you buy Carolina pool tables blood on the window that the guy coverage this radio by sixty veto the\nHigh winds rain hell we get it All right here in the ... if your roof is damaged during a storm or the roof of someone you know or love is eight five five go by your number to call the local pros at may him roofing and you'll have the peace of mind and doing the work hand in hand with your insurance company to make sure there are no problems with that claim everything is done by the book\nWhether it's a hurricane or just a good old fashioned storm eight five five go with a local pros at may him roofing find out more online to ... million roofing dot com\nThis is a ...

I disciplined what do you mean by that\nYeah I think one of the things that he did is he didn't allow things to kind of get him confused and he he was able to look people off so if you looked at some of the throws that he made he did a good job of kind of looking to one side of the field pulling the safety\nAway with his eyes and not airing the receiver down which is something that I see Jake\nDo sometimes you kind of knows who he wants to go to and he doesn't always do a great job look in the receiver off I thought Michael did a good job of if he knew you know ... let's say he knows he wants to go to Brian orders on the left side of the field then at the snap of the ball what you really want to do is you want your eyes to be going to the right side of the field to kind of pull those safety and\nPull the line backers away so that you can kind of open that route up and I thought he did a good job with that\nCoach Eric Wilson who's with us for game ... ... you almost sound like you're ready to give up on Jake Bentley and ... the starter\nNo I'm not doing that I mean I think you know one of the things that coach must champ said which I think is important is you know he's got a lot of experience under his belt with Jake and and Michael's got one game under his belt you know and obviously\nPretty impressive what Michael did as somebody who's never started a big time game for Carolina comes in in a situation where a lot of people were saying hey this is really a must win game to get back on track\nAnd really executed beautifully I Do think\nFrom what must champs that and I agree with this I think the Bentley is struggling or if if the often isn't moving [noise] I Would not hesitate to put ... you know I think you got a quarterback who's proven that he should see playing time and if Jay continues to play the way he's played this year which is pretty inconsistent and not\nTaking care of the football I Would ... and if I thought the often needed a boost\nDoes that play into Bentley's mind or is that fine ... do you want every player looking over their shoulder and thinking you know what if I don't get it done next guy's in\nI mean competition is good at it I mean how many times that we heard must say that competition is good it's good at every edition and you'll hear people say you know to quarterback system isn't good to look around the country I mean\nAlabama's a top team of the country they're not afraid to play to quarterback and she'd say well a guy who would want them a national championship you beat out by another one same situation at Georgia even though Jake\nUm you know is is the guy and he took a position over from the guy who was start report him now he's getting pushed so I think competition the quarterback position is a good thing and more than anything it's not just about competition it's about execution and if Jake can't execute the office at a given time with somebody in the can and see if it gets better\nAnd our coach Eric Wilson joining us with\n... Jonathan rentals back with us now Jonathan you just our coach I you know brown talking too as well about the complimentary players around\nJake Bentley so much of the criticism this season has been about Bentley in his performance but a ... some key drops the ... that have disrupted the temple was the ... uh we've had the game Cox who have struggled to run the football and I again I think it's worth\nPointing out for all the criticism Bentley it hasn't been completely\nOn Bentley shoulders the game ...\nSo do I think you go back to the Kentucky game and again ... fan to watch that game can realize that there were critical drops during that game but I also would go to the fact that the great quarterbacks they're really good quarterbacks and let's be real Jake Bentley was project as a first round quarterback in the NFL Draft coming into the season\nThe great quarterbacks throw their wide receivers open and\nIf you watch shake belly has Heathrow in wide receivers open\nMaybe not maybe maybe not that far um but there have been critical drops I just\nI think the knee injury and everything that he's faced this far to the fact of the office of law and has it been up to par the fact is running game has been written in the south Carolina has expected to be this far and you're placing your ear facing an audience of wind this number\nOf what three in the country against Iran um the odds are stacked against shake belly so if he's able to come into the game and perform at the level that I think that will ... hit the hit the ... the big time receivers that he has\nUm then he'll be okay but I\nI fear I fear that Jake Belize come and go into a situation\nThat he comes into the game he doesn't play well he gets booed off the field and then people are are waiting for Michael ... to come to the game and save the day I just I think you're putting Jake billing do unfortunate situation I think it would be easier for project Billy to come in as a back up to be that kind of hero\nOf today as opposed to coming into the game\nWhen you probably have sixty percent of the fans that are in Williams rice said today that are against shake\nBelly yeah the Josh Kendall earlier recalled it for maybe sixty five thirty five situation but as coach Eric Wilson just pointed out competition\nA breach better play among everyone maybe Bentley looks behind him ceased there's finally somebody who's pushing him for that position and has a good performance today do you think it has been coddled so far as a starting quarterback and South Carolina well I think the gang Cox once the one that first game against Tennessee that first at ... he came in\nUMass and then there was the first ranked opponent the game ... he beat Tennessee and I think that when he was in a way\nYeah I I you know listen Jake Bailey's are very talented quarterback but the narrative goes on that this is a quarterback that should be going to his high school prom you know we've heard that right like this is the guy that should be ... senior year ... I think he believes is a towel to quarterback but I think accountability breed\n'em ... Valls meant as a quarterback it breeds at that evolution as somebody that has to get better and the more that we hear about Jake nearly the more that we see about Jake valley\nHe's still the same quarterback that he was as a freshman quarterback led South Carolina to a ball game and you still living off of that kind of annoying thing that fans gave him um and\nI think if you look at South Carolina's talent base that are that is around them right now you got Bryan Edwards you have ... Samuel shy Smith you have Casey Crosby you have talented wide receivers that are proven and high level of college football it eventually you have to figure out a way to get him the football and and Michael ... we did that\nUm I just you know for for ... for ... will will my ship did I understand it like you appreciate what he's done\nBut landing uppers veteran but yeah but but gain got fans that are going to be and William by saying tonight you watched that football game this afternoon and Jake delay comes out and does not deliver\nLet's say he throws a pick him one of the first two series which I think it's probable he's getting boot off the field and therefore you are broken Jake belly\nNow we'll we'll see again is coach Danielle pointed out a few minutes ago and Steve Kenny hilly not only a former ... quarterback but also a former coaches he knows that the fans aren't the ones who are writing the paycheck necessarily that they're not the ones he's worried about\nMaking happy so we'll see how long much chant\nStays with his veteran again with the chance but ... as well as high time for our crystal bulls game player profile ... by crystal pools Carolina has struggled to stop the run this season will mess champ said this week now one thing you can put his finger on but the game ... to get better now ... says it's all about the distances discipline\nCarolyn pool tables plus has been in Columbia for over a decade and offers the largest selection of truth ... maple in pool tables in the Carolinas not like those Internet sites that claimed to have a real would ... would have been ears for the same price stumped by Carolyn sables plus where you'll be treated like family and they're beautiful showing\nOne of the round the selection of Google's accessories and unique game to their staff is the friendliest in Colombia and there are dedicated to educating their customers before they buy\nMilk breaks or gimmicks just honest answers to all of your questions at the guaranteed lowest price Carolina pool tables plus at fifty seven Seventeen to natural open seven days a week for your convenience stuff either so room today we're calling eight zero three\nSeven nine five three zero five experienced the difference at pool tables\nPlus [noise] did you get a crystal clear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters in service to maintained by crystal pools ... when you're ready to make a splash you can trust crystal ...

V. O.

our broadcast location on our architect\nFrom architect of Columbian course right here several MBP station watching the crowd flow the traffic\nNot so much flowing this afternoon traffic not really moving because as stripper David just pointed out on Twitter a trooper David ... age ... there is nowhere to park if you're planning to catch the game he says or go to the fair you need to park further away and walk no need to drive close in\n... a trooper David pointing out that what they have just run out of parking anywhere near the stadium so uh for anybody still in traffic yeah you're you're gonna be stuck for a while and then you may just\nKeep going in an effort to find parking coach Eric Olson by the way is out this afternoon Jonathan rentals is in our former sports talk show host and we want to talk to John it's a little bit more about the game kind of story lines of the day as we get things reset\nFor South Carolina and Texas a and M. the twenty second ranked Aggies coming up at three thirty on the SEC Network and Jonathan so much of our time today it's been about the quarterback situation you've made it clear you think will must yet made a mistake in naming Jake Bentley is the starter\nWell here's the deal I and then this is not a knock on Jake belly as a starting quarterback I just think that you set him up to fail today because\nTexas a and M. has now sending or on defense only allowing about eighty five yards for again as a as a defense today for South Carolina that has access wanted to have to be able to run the football\nIf they can't run the football all the pressure goes on the starting quarterback that being Jake Bentley let's look at the last four games are Jake belly ... has not been a great quarterback\nFor South Carolina He's been a quarterback thrown to throw prone to throat to deep safety kind of gimme balls Texas a and M. as a very good defense or in in the garden so good and the secondary well yeah but that are rushing but they can take advantage of a of a fifty fifty gimme ball\nI think if you look at where South Carolina fans are coming off the window over ms issue\nIt's probably sixty sixty five percent\nThat want to see Michael ... a\nBelly comes out does not perform up to the capabilities of what the fans expect he's into get booed off the field\nAnd I think that in itself is why we must have made a bad decision because if Jake Bailey comes into the game and just not perform where game kind of fans expect he's in and get booed off and at that point\nYou ruined Jake belly whereas if Michael ... starts the game and\nIts average right and then throws a pig game got fans are going to understand right because he was a high hand you will the high hand he didn't perform and then you bring in Billy Billy has a chance to be the hero\nI think if he starts the game which is going to do and just make things happen you have a chance or ruined Jake belly\nWell we'll we'll see how the game plan plays out as well I think the game ... put a little too much pressure\nOn Bentley just because she could because he was that smart coach's son they knew if they gave him so many Arpaio's at the line of scrimmage that he would be intelligent enough to make those decisions maybe too much on a young ... shoulders I think they'll Taylor that back a little bit today but they'll also have to adjust knowing that Bentley doesn't have the mobility that he's had improved\nAnd so he's still three years in right he's still three years in like how much is the narrative of the scores of actually started getting a high school season and go into his high school senior prom gonna last doesn't it doesn't hold water anymore verging belly\nBecause he hasn't been that guy is an elevated game to level the game gods fans expected years ago when he lets out onto a bowl game he just hasn't been that guy\nUm and Michael ...\nLed South Carolina and the game winning drive against Missouri\nUm so I think if you're a game caught fan right now and you're looking at different options for this game got programmed to move forward as Bush love is you've had for Jake belly you have to look at results and Michael is correct yet and the most adverse of\nCircumstances in a downpour came back on the field in is only start ever\nAnd lead you to when I'm Billy has got to perform today otherwise game got fans who are in turn on you and turned on ... very quickly\nAnd I think they'll turn not only a Bentley I think there'll be some boos for much dampen the handle that situation and keep in mind this is not the first time will mess campus faced a conundrum in regards to how he handles as quarterbacks that was certainly one of the biggest issues facing him when he was in Gainesville I let's chicken with Rob Sanders once again we were\nWatching several key SEC games the too early games both with teams poised for upsets Rob are we seeing that play out\nWell maybe so up in Tennessee but a Vanderbilt right now they have fallen behind Florida the gators Nelly twenty seven twenty for about twelve minutes to go in the fourth quarter Tennessee though\nThey are beating up on all of them right now twenty seven to Seventeen about nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter looks like they are in the red zone and may punch in for another touchdown\nAre Rob thank you very much will continue to follow those scores Jonathan rushing killing nationality joining a former game cube me for a debate that about who should start this afternoon that debate that everyone's having right now Jonathan and Kelly are here with tailgate talk\nThings through suffer or you know one thing I was glad about last week's game what's that seemed coach boom back and we're form he was booming on the sidelines over there and get to see enough of that\nMan I got to stay through the entire game and that was something special in the rain that's why I and we played so well in the rain and the third quarter particularly I think we should have scheduled da and I'm game for some time Thursday morning when we were getting that hurricane we they killed a an idea\nAnd I'm saying if I was ... boom I would've had irrigation system installed over Williams rice study more open to the full tilt ... before the kickoff were always playing though right\nBut here we are with another tough SEC opponent come into Williams Bryce and a lot of controversy right now about the quarterback position Jonathan\nOh we had an opportunity to ask former quarterback Blake Mitchell about that now you're excited for the fabric of the Bentley back\nYou know what I I think that going to get a desert as well\nSo if you were Michael's or an accurate right now you'd be saying you should put me in\nA what I mean the guy with the hot and I may prove that he could win the game and it can make good decisions I made three touchdowns no interceptions I Believe you got to let him have the ball until he proved\nThat caught me off guard we talked to him on friday morning and I said to myself wait a second quarter shake Bentley has established himself as he far superior quarterback to anybody else on that roster and that's why he starts and that's why he should get his job back but then I went and I looked at some stats and so I see the Drake Bentley's quarterback ratings\nAre pretty consistent I mean he's gone down a little bits of twenty sixteen years ... first year is that a one forty QB rating\nLast year one thirty so far this year one thirty one his average per throw has gone down from seven point five to seven point one this year as a seven point oh there's interceptions are rising he had for his first year twelve is second year and he's already got six this year so he's on\nPoint to be about fourteen interceptions for the year if he continues at this pace\nMy Michael's gr negatives only had a couple of starch he's gotta QB rating after last week's game of one forty five point nine and his average per throw is seven point to and as we know he has no interceptions\nIt when we talk about every game is could be a game of inches when\nYou look back on their schedule they lost Alabama okay but then they want to give to Arkansas and they beat Kentucky and it was over time so it's going to be a close match up between the two but when you put scar and if he gets a little bit of advantage we're going to need just a little bit of advantage\nAnd like the show to use the hot here and now I have seen some quote unquote experts on the Internet mocking fans who think that maybe a switch your quarterback would do with some good because they point out it's the defense the game ... defenses inconsistent uh-huh okay well let's just look at the stats Shelley the game cooks defenses rank\nGiving you a free I mean that's very I just like any in the back of beer and get a brief ten pound bag of ice the chili down\nBeen dumped convenience stores are tailgating headquarters with everything you need for the big game and
