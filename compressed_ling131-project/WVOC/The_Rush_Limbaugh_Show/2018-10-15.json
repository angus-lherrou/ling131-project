Danley within within the stupid country for so many years you're willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like NATO side\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be westerns\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nSpring mind to me at the ... each day say you don't have to eat it was ...\nThe custom furniture and certainly I comfort mattresses on sale now at shaping furniture take high twenty six to exit Ninety One and ... and look for the big red\nChair feet and CNN they been exposed to become expose dishonest truth\nFraudulent radio fight [noise]\nW.

celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is uh just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis that killed the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you have to try again I Know that whole aunts and my answer is this I Will always be there\nWith NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf white in General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less they still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump\nI've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell them about my opinion is that the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I'm being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York\nMedia where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved appraised coverage but it all vanished when he ran and he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nThis honest that's the word he uses instead of biased and I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but thought he knew before he ran for office and I think\nA lot about the left a lot about\nDemocrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now

it comes to income taxes now which small percentile of tax payers also paid three percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers the top\nPoint zero zero one\nPercent the top one one hundredth of a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone pain free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little round it to fourteen hundred fourteen hundred tax payers paid more\nThan the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for gene hungry\nPeople out of three hundred and some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent so you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't
