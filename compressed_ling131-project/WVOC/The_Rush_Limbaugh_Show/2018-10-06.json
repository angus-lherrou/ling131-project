{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And we often do we will have kind of layers of flexibility and what I mean by that is instead of having a big pile of money in cash we still want your money working for you as much as possible so maybe we have a smaller amount of money in cash you know maybe you like to have an actual cash you know in a safe in your home maybe a little bit in savings and checking at a local bank\nMaybe you have a little bit in an online banks have FDIC insured that's being a higher interest rate and then where can we go after that well if you have equity in your home we may want to consider a home equity line of credit that you can borrow against an emergency a reverse mortgage is a possibility you can have a a line of credit as a reverse mortgage that you would not have to make payments on\nAnd then the other thing is there are some types of savings and investments that are not requiring you to tie up your money for a long time but maybe can offer a higher yield and so we try and do in this example Jen is helping you maintain as much flexibility is you need\nJust trying to squeeze more return out of that money and you know for some people that want to be conservative and leave a decent chunk of money in something you know very safe that can be pretty big difference as far as the returns so that's just one example that I Would use as far as different\nAreas of flexibility the other point that I Would make is you want different fucks points or flexibility potential based on the more significant decisions you're making your life so the date of your retirement or things like that certainly wouldn't have flexibility with those assets\nAnd usually you have that it might be when you make your pension decision it might be when you're deciding what to do with your four one K.\nSo those are all really important to have and it ties in beautiful legion if you hire a retirement plan or to help you we love to do is start a relationship with you\nAnd then help you all the way through so if you've not retired yet help you figure out what that plan is supposed to look like and then help you all the way up to that transition into retirement and then through retirement as well and that's really the most gratifying thing for us because we get to see you living the retirement of your dreams we call the custom built retirement plan in the very first step\nTo putting that together is taking advantage of a no cost new obligation retirement review\nWhich you can get started by calling right now at age ... three nine retire\nWe'll look at the big picture talk to you about your needs but really about your once in your goals and dreams for retirement and help you put together a plan if you said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and mentioned the show to claim one of the ... that we have reserved for today's listeners at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nYou're listening again he said your retirement with pat ... founder of preservation specialists\nI'm generally jak alongside pat just gave me the phone number the website is retire with pat dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we are designing a blueprint for financial house looking at\nSome of the different components that need to be included so it will stand the test of time it is built to last when we include all of these different elements pat what is the final pillar or final components that we should make sure we include in our financial blueprint\nWell in a this is another one where I Am going to get on my soapbox is really the pillar of this kind of the mortar that holds all these various parts together and that is an actual comprehensive plan it's got pull all this stuff together and we mean by that is it's a plan to consider what your goals and dreams and vision is pre retirement\nIt's going to consider your assets any deaths you might have to consider your income it's going to consider how to help protect you from all those different risks we've talked about earlier it's going to consider those different areas of investing we talked to her because you need growth but you also need preservation and you need income that's how retirement is so much different\nThan when you're investing when you're younger there's all those various facets to it and then once you have all of that put together now you have that plan you need to implement the plan and the need to manage the plan\nSo that's where we think it's such a difference first of all if you just buy a retirement plan from someone you still need to implement it and then you need to manage it over time and then a lot of times a lot of people in our industry or just investment advisers and they may be very good at that\nBut it just doesn't make sense to us and that's why our clients love our structure because we're trying to pull it altogether because your investments are incredibly related to your income in retirement which is very related to your taxes so that's the way I Would say and having a comprehensive retirement plan is the eighth pillar\nSo it's not the best idea to build a home without the help of some sort of architect or contractors some sort of expert my final question for you today Patty is what's your take on people trying to build a financial house for retirement on their own without some of that guidance you were just referring to\nWe all have different personalities we have people that come to us that have worked with other financial professionals we have a lot of people who haven't so they've kind of put their head down and said you know what I'm going to plow money in the four one K. and then I'm going to read up on retirement stuff maybe that come to one of our retirement classes and that's how we meet\nSo a lot of times they're just thinking okay it's time to get serious maybe I Need to talk to a professional\nWhereas someone else may have worked with a number of people over the years I Would say that it's not that it's impossible to yourself but the question is you need to ask yourself are do you have the time to do all the research to understand all these various areas 'cause it's a lot more than investing sometimes you'll have interest in investing\nBut there's a lot more to it than that in the second piece is do you have the interest in is that really what you want to be doing in retirement\nThat's probably the biggest change I've seen Jen in my career I found ten or Fifteen Years ago more people that were more interested in that you know going back to my career spans back to the day traders and people thought oh you know what I'll do I'll sit at a computer all day\nAnd I'll make a bunch of money you know you don't hear that any more but I Hope it didn't farewell from those people so I'm not of the school of thought that it's impossible however that's what I Would ask yourself is\nDo you have the time to devote to doing it right because you only get one chance at retirement and you better not mess it up\nAnd then number two is that how you want to be spending your retirement those are things you need to be asking yourself\nOf course we're a little biased because this is what we love to do are passionate about it we love building those long term relationships with our clients and kind of helping see them through retirement or if they're already retired just helping to reduce their fears and stress and helping them kind of create that plan\nIt's going to do all those different things to find someone that is a true planner that comprehensive and its independent\nThose are the pieces that can help you build that retirement plan of your dreams\nAnd ultimately what we're trying to do is help you sleep well at night and do the things in retirement that you want to do that is where we started this show and that's where we'll finish it find the things that your vision your goal and dream of retirement\nAnd spend your time there that's why we do the retirement plans we create and that's why we offer the no costs no obligation retirement review to get started call right now at age ... three\nNine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three if you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement ... three nine seven three eight four seven three\nWe have a busy schedule but we set aside spot specifically for listeners of today's show so to take advantage call right now at eight o three nine

preservation specialist is not permitted to offer and no statement made during the show shell constitute tax or legal advice\nAnd to a degree think of it this way in in ... in terms of blocking it or the other plants from taking it up so I'm don't forget the fertilizer would that rug rats will get much more uniform German nation and much quicker stay on the grass before we get really cold and the salt temperatures drop\nA next tax question how do I get rid of nuts edge\n[noise] um [noise]\nAh yeah I could joke and say move but actually there's some pretty good ways of getting rid of nuts edge\nAnd believe it or not a normal say August September is a great time to control nuts edge because is it it's reaching the end of its life cycle\nAnd that the key is getting to that to a tumor that's on the ground how do we get pesticide chemicals down to that to her so that we get complete control well during the peak of the growing season everything's growing up ... we're we're pushing all of that energy approached plants trying to grow at this time of year it's it's collecting\nAnd and making all of this energy and is trying to it's best to take advantage to Burr down at a crowded planet needs to survive in knows that that the end is near ... this this growing season and it's got to be able to survive so that it can spread out next year\nThis is great time of year such hammer a monument there's so many good products out there that are that are very easily applied very safe to using the landscape varies from\nAnimals to patch two young children to yourself as as the applications are a lot of good products that they lost sight products so this is it to me as a good time of year normally it would be a little light being an October\nHowever because things are still actively grow in the plant has yet to snag some go dormant that I think it's a great time to get out there and do a little bit of nuts such control what I Would advise you would not such\nMow the lawn typically it's in ... could be an shrub bad so if it's in a law that I'd like to see you mow the lawn white about two or three days let the nuts such kind of pop back up um everything slowing down your loans are slowing down so once it kind of germ or doesn't German I but once it grows back up a a wee bit\nGet out there spray use a good so factor or horticultural something like that to cut that wax layer to get that chemical in to the lake surface\nDo not know it for as long as you can humanly possible try not to mow it I'm into that desire grass gets to a point where you think it's getting above and beyond are getting the unruly right\nThe longer that we can allow that chemical to try and slow K through the plant to that tube or the much better off we're going to be in a much better control that we're going to get so a little tip on on the nuts such appreciate those tax seven one three zero seven feel free to send them to them\nWe're going to the phone lines if you'd like to give us a call feel free at one eight hundred three four seven one six three\nMike found us there so I Know they're open I Know they were let's talk when Mike how am I can welcome to the art pros\nHey morning males it morning by my questions are probably gonna be like a lot of other people this time of years out fest you yep um I had mine or seated here a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I don't know if it's just been my observation system we've had and heavy rain but you you couldn't tell it if you looked at the law and it's\nIt's a compact that like I was up for a full of it was billed as a matter of fact I feel like I should have actually wrote appealed it instead of a court it but nevertheless ah some of the stuff that taking off like gang busters and there was some other stuff is as either washed out\nOr or the seated properly by the fellow that did it yep but there's some more stuff on it and so it's more of the starter stuff and it's just laying there it's not doing that\nIt's just laying there on top of this this asshole hard grass\nOkay what what are you doing as far as watering I I guess would be my question\nI guess that's where I was going to go next to I was gonna you know water can you water these seeds too much\nI you know to a degree yes I I mean if you and and here's how I judge watering um and and you know Mike I'm really appreciate the call because\nFast you bluegrass blends or the cool season grasses it's what I grow what's what I enjoy um I actually was not lazy this year and believe it or not Mike you're going to find this hard to believe I put my seat out several weeks ago I think I hear you know always preached about that September fifteenth date\n'em for a couple of reasons number one ... you know I don't care what the weather is get it out there a little bit early get it done um you're reaping the benefits of it now because we had multiple thunderstorms in heavy day lose rain after that September fifteenth today and in my personal yard\nI had some washing the seat it's given me an opportunity to go back and we still have some warm weather you know we got lucky\nI ... I really wish it would hurry up and transition to fall which should because based on are are linked the days and things of that nature we need to hurry up\nAnd get some transition so we can Horton these plants off before we get to winter but at the watering too much here's how I judge it you order too much if you're floating the seed and its float in it's actually moving within the law that's too much water\nYou your water and too much if you begin to see the sun is a a an algae across the algae grow on the soil surface which having ... like you do that's a very real possibility that you might begin to see this ... I'm sitting on top of the loan\nAlmost an algae look which a lot of times it can turn into algae so we want we're a little bit concerned about that and longtime water into much however you've got seats sitting directly on top of dirt correct\nYes\nSome so my fear is is you know I'll be ... says you're in ... so you're either bring Spartanburg County and looking at the the drought monitor those two counties are not in any form a drought but I Will say this it's Ninety degrees outside yesterday's a prime example slight breeze\nHumidity was there was a little muggy yesterday but not miserable okay\nBut during the day if that scene begins to dry out he becomes a very real issue for us because it can be the death of the ceiling once that seed crack that code and it begins to send that first one to root down\nIf if it dries out for even as little as an hour and becomes parts and dry that can be death of the ceiling in and that can be an issue so what I tell folks is if we can do short intervals of water middle of the day\nWhen we know that the sun's up we'll get a little breeze things the surface who's going to begin to dry out a little bit more then that's what we need to do if you can set that irrigation clock up to water two to three minutes short burst short intervals a couple of times in the middle of the afternoon I feel like that's great\nYou know but once you get that saw hydrated we don't need those deep water ... see we need that once the seed germinate ... it's a week old and we begin to think about ... and we want to start driving those roots deeper so how long has it been since you put the actually the second round the seed out\nThey'll close to a week so it should have really taken off I\nThink up so here in the next few days I mean you know just as fast you can take anywhere from I've seen that Germany as quick as five days and they could take as long as two weeks it just depends on how perfect because of that that seed bed and that environment being a little bit tougher seed bed\nA little bit tougher environment ... you may find that hey everything's still well one of the things that I like to do 'cause I had a few ways like that in my lawn or this year Mike\nIs is go into the sea where you see the seed sitting on top and take your finger in this very gently touch it try to stay in you know sees laying down inside try to stay ended up you got a a kind of a narrow type or at the top end\nAnd the more rounded type or at the bottom in um that bottom end is what's gonna attach quicker makes sense right\nI'm trying to stay in that seat up trying to flick it see if you can move it just would light touch is and if you can't move it what it's telling me you really can't see that you see the shoot growing yet at the top but you may already have that bottom roots beginning attack it and hold it on the soul if you can get to that point and keep it consistently wet\nDuring the the the the windy or sunnier times during the afternoon you will be fine they germinate give it a few days and you'll see a lot more seed terminating as you progress\nOkay well I basically been hitting the large part of the lawn every two two and a half hours I guess yeah and also parts of the law and that that are in full blown off from from noon until sunset and they seemed to dry out\nReally fast so I've been really trying to spread some about every hour if I can\nYeah if you can give give it a light watering a little quick missed or something and and um\nAnd and you may you know as far as how what us to solve take a look and see if it looks really saturated and just to mach ... drowned out a bit um\nYou know it it's it's a fine line you play when you're German dating they see that many really is and and I wish it were just so simple that I could say hey such a time clock for this amount of minutes per zone and set it\nThis many times are at this time during the day and everything will be great it's just kind of hard to say because like you said your own lawn you have these little micro climates you got to areas that a little more shady that hold more moisture you've got to areas that are in full sun that get more exposure so they dry out\nQuicker correct yeah yeah exactly so okay can I say what I say spreads\nI'm means Brits him I just if I if I either do it with a a garden hose myself or with a with irrigation system or with just a regular sprinkler I'm I'm just basically just wedding the tops of these seeds and that's it that's perfectly great\nIt's a fine line I tell you what I Do our allow it to catch in the middle of the afternoon when it's a little bit drier and leaves begin to draw from the surface and likely blow a whistle blower I'm an Iran and moreover if you've got to be there to really hadn't fully germinate and I'm afraid that you're going to move that seat so a little bit of light blowing up for work\nRight ... thank you might have a great weekend I feel like\nYou're listening to your show brought to you by Carolina fresh farms is like to be here when we come back from the bottom and our break we'll get to those tax that seven one three zero seven in the phone lines are open I

encroachment of cuts zoo and English on the on the large oak trees in my backyard\nThese trees around the edge of a heavily wooded area and the invasion of the vines is relentless thank you for your help Bill Bill I appreciate the tax because I'm quite honestly\nI was playing a little bit of golf yesterday and ah\nI Know folks um you you begin to sound my wife didn't quite understand that she's like really you're playing golf and I was like well honey you don't understand you know I'm pretty deep and the golf course um industry do a lot of renovation work and\nAnd um and help a lot with that and it's it's something we do through a different side company would have called new life turf and I said you know quite honestly honey it's playing golf or the designer of the golf course so in essence says his golf course and it has our grass on it so I I justified it's worked folks okay I promise it's worth\nThe interesting thing this particular golf course I'm Out in the country has the same situation old areas over whether there is to have a lot of ...\nAnd ... superintendent has done an outstanding job of of trying to reclaim announced a essay that jokingly but it's true full of reclaiming 'cause ... you can become such a nuisance I'm\nHard to believe that that that our own government brought this year for for various reasons depending on what you read what you believe um\nIt has really become such an invasive plant across the southeast and has been for a number of years\nUm the problem is is is the catch it early in the light infestation is just beginning ... really you can go out there mechanically pull it do whatever dig up put back trace back\nUm this customers also talking about the English Ali you can do the same thing if you can trace it back to that parent plant\nAnd dig it up you're almost ... the problem is once it's gone several years four or five six eight ten twelve years of an infestation man you got crowns plants everywhere the cubs who becomes kind of what do you stand at the ground it's a nuisance\nThe thing I Will tell you I'm gonna have to use some type of chemical control as well as some good old physical mechanical means\nI Would get in there because we cut the English hobbies growing up the tree you can turn around the Trump without damaging the bark\nAnd we don't want to damage the bar but you can pull it loose with your hands touching clippers\nClip all those those runners all those bonds and growing up the tree\nPull them you know or the other foot and a half ... up the tree\nCut another piece out so now we have a gap of about a foot and a half from from the base of the tree to wear those bonds are attached to free\nThe ... very quickly the bonds of virtually rotten die out once they released those those little ten rules that attach it to the bar you can pull on them pull 'em out of the tree very easily instead of pulling the day you cut them where they're attached and it becomes a nuisance\nTo me that's a good way I'm over a period of time to get rid of it from going up the tree everything else pulling back away from the trunk of tree you got living going to shoot and you can use some non selective herbicides such as round up\nMy favorite thing to do is you can you can mix in a product sometimes you see the coldest brush killer read the active ingredient there's a chemical called core purely C O something ...\nUm if you mix that with a little bit of the non selective it'll do a really good job I Will advise you this um ... is going to kill anything that's broadly so be aware of your surroundings you new trees and desire Trump's we don't want this special if you put an ounce let the ...\nLike I'm Around up in there\nWe want to make sure we directly target what we're trying to control and eradicate so if you do that um you got a long battle of head of you're gonna have to maintain it and keep up with it for a couple of seasons but you can really get grasp and reclaim this from ... but what a what a tough animal\nOr we're going to go to the phone lines we have Linda ... who's been waiting patiently hello London and welcome to the yard procedure\nI dare I say within rate increase that three years at least ... feet on the line to make it look better flower here but we like to do a little markets where that'd be buying our house\nOkay without really taking up the whole thing is there anything we can do to kind of like encourage more fat skill\nAnd like they're staying with some of that and low rider perennial right the good things than yeah ... yeah go\nAhead you so you are and gallons bill right how how shaded it is then alone and do you know what kind of tree it is that you're trying to grow and under\nIts a broad leaf high it\nCorrectly and down and if that doesn't drop a lot of individual\nA tiny needles okay but it traps like in clumps cell that's what kind of a tree it is and I say it's pretty much just keeps dying okay and we keep putting you know ... basically so they have the first question\nAll right so ah so the first thing you've done which I think you have done but I Would ask you to do a little bit more due diligence as you said you're getting ready to purchased the home I'm so it sounds like a plan on being here for a while\nSo the the first thing I Would do is I Would really assess and make certain that you're growing the grass that you won't because it sounds like this environment you have a couple of options it can be ... because you do have some shade\nIt could also you know in gallons ... you're in the upside of South Carolina beautiful area by the way the ... metropolitan there it was just beautiful area\nUm you can also look down the down the road I think in the future we're what's the possibility do we want to go more warm season or two a warm season grass like us or Asia because when you say it's hands free Linda the pantry yes it it does give some shade\nBut it also gives filtered sunlight more so than a big towering ... from you you get on an oak tree it's really dark and\nAnd it can be very high humidity areas and you really kind of a lot then in the upstate if you're in that situation you're kind of locked into ... but when it's a ... shape from a pantry sometimes we capture enough sunlight that maybe is orange is an option now\nMaybe we'll try that because we've been here three years now not had any luck\nAnd the reason people or are getting away and and and I don't want to steer you either way I just want you to weigh both options\nThe reason people are beginning to get away from ... and I watch this decline for a number of years and we still sell a lot of fuss cue side and by the way I got to put a plug into fest you saw looks great coming out of our our mountain foreign lands for those that are listening to it needs some solid ... give us a call we're back into some really good product\nUm because it's beginning to cool off and it's fallen and it's that the time of year for it to grow\nBut we still sell a lot of fast you but I Will say every year I'm watching these cells a professor you see for those receding the fest you saw every year I'm watching it declined and declined to decline but I'm watching as always just sells\nContinually increased year after year the reason being people in our neck of the woods when are we most active outdoors is normally what\nApril through summer three have members and and and\nAnd they'll fight of well I won't green grass year round well come December most people inside anyway it's cold it's dreary out you're not sitting outside unless you're a weirdo like me I Love these emerging to give me a forty two degree rainy day I think it's 'cause I was in December I Love the weather\nBut most people spend their time outdoors and that's when they want their loan to look at best\nAnd you know it's it's a trade off ... going to look bad three months in the summer there's always going to be dormant I'm not going to say it's going to look bad it's going to be dormant for three months in the winter so you gotta you gotta weigh those options and and you all should look at that long term but if you want to do something immediate now you mentioned prone Iraq grass\nI wouldn't go strictly perennial rock grass because with our heat our humidity\nIf we're going plenty or rock grass out in the full sun yes it's going to transition out in ah once we get warm next late spring early summer it's going to happen\nSo you're going to be left with nothing but if you put a little bit perennial ... into a shaded environment and you maintain it properly the perennial rock grass will persist throughout the summer so\nNeedless to say if you maintain a cool season alone being a fast you with a blend of parading around with a blend of a bluegrass you're you're always going to be in the situation this time every year are really in September you're going to be receding and kind of read vigor writing your loan\nSo a detailing before you do anything can help a lot but I think you need to address this or compact from there before you do anything whether you're going to plant blueberries and do a blueberry garden or you're going to plan a long no matter what you're gonna plant you need to correct the compassion in the ... plain and simple\nKay says clarify understanding of man and lost\nNow as far as the fungus in that

matter is is most of us are living longer than we expect to live so we need to pay close attention to the fact that we are living longer and that this budget will more than likely have to be increased\nDue to inflation taxes or unplanned expenses\nBrick you give a couple of great opportunities for people to get a better handle on the importance of budgeting how to structure that budget both matching the expenses that will have and how to generate the income to meet\nAnd exceed those expenses through the individual review that you offer or to get started with that book that explains this important process and how to structure that plant income allocation\nYes Pete and plenty of opportunities for people to meet with us in the office discuss what your individual situation looks like listen it is always different for every retiree or potential retirees that we've ever met with there's never been to plans that are exactly the same\nEverybody has different resources for income everybody has different expenses and what the purpose should be is is to take and create and craft\nYour individual retirement income planned based on your needs and objectives of what you want and need to do throughout the remainder of your life and then also if you're married\nOr have a significant other making sure that both of you are taking care of throughout your lifetime and then beyond that if legacy is important to you then how do we make sure that that retirement income plan takes you both through the remainder of your life\nCall us today a hundred for nine months six two two zero get some information on upcoming classes that we have educational opportunities the month of October is full we've got a great dinner seminar we only do two sets of those a year\nAnd we do the spring and the fall we've got that coming up the burdens in Mount pleasant learn more about income allocation\nPick up a book income allocation at that seminar college today a hundred for nine one sixty two zero will get information on upcoming educational event or a if you're hot topic is I Want to sit down and start now\nWe'll get started call us today eight hundred for nine one six two two zero and we'll get you into the office at the coastal financial planning group right here in Charleston or up in the middle ends on main street in Columbia\nHundred for nine one six two two zero the number to call Rick budgeting allows us to set and know how much it will take to live once the paycheck stops and we've been able to maintain our lifestyle based on\nThat paycheck and it offered us the security to know predictably that we wouldn't be able to continue accounting for the expenses that we need but when that paycheck stops that's a pretty dramatic shift in our income in our budget situation for those who have been lucky enough to be higher income earners the difference that's going to make is all that\nMuch more dramatic so do you find that the people who traditionally may have been able to afford the luxury of overlooking the budgeting process it becomes actually more important for those folks certainly Pete\nEspecially if you want to continue the same lifestyle whatever that is\nIt that's important to you than budgeting will become important because now we can't drive that paycheck up anymore we could if we went back to work and a lot of people do that for many different reasons but we're limited in the amount that we can take out of these assets\nFor two reasons number one we want to make sure first and foremost that the assets last as long as we do and our loved ones do and then secondly we want to make sure that the\nPlan that we're doing is proper to avoid any common pitfalls or mistakes that people make without planning for the risks issues and opportunities or retirement so analyzing that is the first step\nAnd that's what helps us develop the retirement income plan budgeting is a critical part of that retirement income plan and gathering that information we need to compare what you think your retirement number is like those commercials on TV you know they just showed that check\nAnd how much you need and a lump sum there is much more that goes into it than just determining what that lump sum a mountain needs to be\nWe need to determine what that lump sum amount is going to cover and how to properly draw down or withdraw out of that lump sum of money to accomplish our goals and objectives through the remainder of our lives\nWhen working wreck again we can set our lifestyle and our spending habits based off of what we're bringing in that predictability of the paycheck but in retirement\nWe're basing this off of the lump sum that we have\nAnd we can't just go randomly about making withdraws without a strategic plan on how to\nMaintain and sustain our ability to make those do you find that without the budget in other words people may run the risk and have the habit of overspending early on in retirement or maybe the other end of the spectrum there are so afraid of overspending that they don't live a fulfilling life even though they would have the ability to generate income\nYes and both of those scenarios will occur with out proper budgeting and an income plan so why not a void that stress of wonder and worry why not have a ironclad plan\nThat you can start with start with a basis\nListen folks the budget isn't going to be perfect you're not going to get those expenses right on the money you're not going to be able to gather all the perfect exact numbers but start with a plan\nAnd then meet at least on an annual basis to review and examine what's actually happened in the last twelve months and then it just\nThat's the best thing about planning is is that if you start with the foundational plan and get those numbers down you've got a course to run on and then you make adjustments because the only thing constant in life has changed we have to make sure that we're addressing changes that occur in our planning procedures\nAnd then make adjustments for those changes as they occur so important for us to look at budging and certainly important for us to understand is you just said ... the difference between the paycheck\nAnd the ... check in retirement we're now going to be dependent on being able to create that income from our assets and our retirement income streams and we're no longer going to be drawing a pay check out of that business 'cause we probably sold it or\nNo longer going to be getting that employers check coming to us so we have to create our own play check for retirement\nWe're talking with Rick turkey the president and founder of coastal financial planning group about the importance of the budgeting process in determining our retirement success let's make sure that we understand and address this crucial aspect\nOf our financial and retirement plan so that we can have the confidence to maintain our spending ability and our lifestyle throughout retirement it's part of the planning process in the strategic review that Rick turkey offers their coastal financial planning group all you need to do is pick up the phone and give a call if you'd like to take advantage\nEight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nThat's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero remember also he has made copies of the book that explain this process and how to structure the plan to generate that income income allocation he has made that book available if you would like to start with the information an education offered through that easy read\nPick up the phone and

got plenty of events and October that we can get two additional education but the first step is learn a little bit about income allocation and request that book today\nWould break we'll be right back and give a call now eight hundred for nine one six to ... zero we've asked more with Richard Gere and your game plan\nOoh\n[noise]\nThanks for listening to your game plan for retirement my name is Rick turkey and I'm the president and founder of the coastal financial planning group right here in Charleston and I believe in the income allocation model for the power and freedom of reliable retirement income I also\nBelieve that you deserve retirement on your terms with security and stability if you believe the same as part of this show I'll make five time available to you if you say to your life to remain self sufficient throughout retirement [noise] call now from here's what you receive receive a complementary\nNo obligation review of your game plan for retirement this three step review could help you keep more of your money in your pockets working harder for you by assessing the fees that you may be paying on your money will help you review evaluate and potentially reduce taxes you may be paying now in throughout retirement will also help you spot the red\nFlags that could damage your chances for living the retirement you envision\nWe will help evaluate the risks your money is exposed to and most importantly we'll help you identify your\nIncome gaps and design an income allocation plan to provide you the peace of mind throughout your retirement that allows you to live day to day\nWithout worrying about your financial planning this is what we offer to the listeners called today for complimentary no obligation three step review to make a positive impact on your financial future the number to call his eight hundred for nine one six two two zero [noise]\nRemember though that when you were in your working years and you got that paycheck by the time you saw that money Uncle Sam had already taken his portion he had his hand out and you pay taxes\nRemember that we just talked about before things you do with money and retirement the first thing is is you have to pay taxes so you're getting that gross distribution but now you have to pay taxes on it\nAnd typically that's done on a quarterly estimate or paid before April fifteenth when you pay your individual taxes but remember this\nWhen you were working again you'd have to check it already had the taxes taken out and\nNow often times some savings was also accounted for so that was number four and are things that we need to do with the money you saved into your four one K. and then you got your net now we need to take this lump sum that's coming to us which is the gross amount\nAnd create the net amount which is what's leftover after everything in our budget\nTakes our money from us I Would like to say this when we talked about the four areas pay taxes pay bills spend and have fun and save\nYou mentioned Pete that the first two weren't too much fun paying taxes and paying bills\nSo what I like to do is say well let's do this first then in retirement let's do number three and four first if we have a budget we can do this let's spend and have a little bit of fun let's give ourselves a reward for that hard work that we did over all those years leading into retirement and then let's save\nA little bit now for fun later\nThan will know exactly what's leftover and that will be enough to pay our taxes and pay our bills but in retirement remember the numbers that we see in our accounts are often what we received from distributions\nAnd that's a gross amount or a gross number and that's how we figure what we can do with the money afterwards are for things that we can do with the money it's very important that you factor in Uncle Sam\nFor your retirement budget our income planning process will build all those numbers into your income plan and you'll see exactly what the state and federal withholding will be so you'll know what you're left over money is to pay bills spend and have fun and save\nRick I think that as we look at the budget we may retire and be looking at our nest egg our lump sum and retirement\nAccounts the four oh one K. is the IRAs and we've been lucky enough to build up a million dollar nest egg there for us and we look at that million and say hey we shouldn't be able to generate forty or fifty thousand dollars a year fairly easily but we forget that ten to twenty percent off the top is probably going to go\nTo paying those taxes so that fifty thousand dollars that we took out\nTen thousand of that is not ours we're going to have to live off of forty thousand dollars and that means that that million dollars that we're looking at it is not really a million it's more like eight hundred thousand that we have to live off of an retirement\nYes so when someone let's say a current client comes to us ... and they say I Need to do a withdraw from my retirement account I Want to take a trip or whatever I wanted to leave that money in the account so that would generate some growth and now I Need to use it we always have to ask this question\nAnd it gets people to think right away will I needed ten thousand for that trip\nThen I say well let's look at your tax rate do you need me to bump that up to factor in taxes so that your net amount is ten thousand dollars so do we need to withdraw twelve thousand dollars or Thirteen thousand dollars depending on what your tax number is\nSo we should always make sure that we add on top of our actual planned expense to account for taxation when we're budgeting and when we're making withdraws from are certainly from our retirement accounts that are have never been taxed yet\nAnd a lotta people Rick rightfully so are a very proud of themselves for being debt free at some point in their lifetimes no credit card debts they got paid off vehicles even have the paid off home but when we look at\nThat account balance Rick if we have saved our money by differing and delaying paying tax that is in fact\nIn essence a debt a bill that we owe to Uncle Sam and if we don't want to really think about it that way just wait around until Seventy and a half and they start requiring minimum payments on that\nYes I Do say that that somewhat of a tax bomb on some people that they don't plan on that or\nThey're not getting proper tax advice as to how to defuse that potential extra added income that comes at Seventy and a half from those qualified retirement plans or ... whatever they are they've never been tax that's never been tax money so that's going to be a big chunk of money\nFor those that were successful saving in those\nRetirement plans that they have to factor into their income taxes now and that could skew your Social Security benefits to bump them into a higher tax bracket ...\nOften said that the tax code works like the whack a mole game you add this and three other molds pop their head up in different areas that you have to address so again we should always\nFactor in taxes into our budgeting and into our income planning process there's something that we cannot avoid we can do some tax Ford planning to help defuse some of those future attacks time bomb such as the required minimum distribution of the IRA if we sit down now in our early sixties\nOr our mid sixties before Seventy and try and develop a plan that helps to\nMinimize those in ... I\nWas with which would you say that we are in a better situation if we proactively enact our own planning and strategy or are we better off if we wait and the way and defer to the government's plan that they have already in place for us\nI think you've got other people laughing with you on that one thing I think we need to take control I think we need to own our retirement plan\nAnd if we're a business owner and this is our business and it's what we've worked hard to set aside than we want to control how that money is spent and we want to stop money from slipping through the cracks to Uncle Sam that we don't have to pay if we do some proper tax for planning\n... you've referred several times in the program to being a business owner and I know that you do have\nMany business owner clients but I Want to clarify this for just a moment what you are referring to is retirement in retirement than I Am a bit of retirement is what you're talking about you are a business owner your dollars all your employees\nAnd in retirement your tax situation is handled much more like a business owner it's ten Ninety nine income\nIt is it is so we have to plan on that and we have to take the responsibility that we are going to be in charge of that\nIf we don't then we just say all like the sailboat without the writer and let the government do what they're going to do to us and guess what I'm sure they have a plan for us that's going to get more tax money out of us if we let them decide\nAgain we want to plan effectively and pro active\nLead to make the best use of each and every dollar so that they can go to help us achieve our goals and our vision\nOf retirement not that we have a wasted them or paid unnecessary expenses or put them at unnecessary risk or had unnecessary taxes taken out and that can only be done through pro active planning\nThe book income allocation that Rick turkey has made available goes a long way in explaining the premise and the structure of the plan that can help you do that and Rick turkey can personally helped take you the rest of the way through that specific planning strategy session and his three step\nReview if you'd like to take advantage of either offer for the book income allocation\nOr for the individual review and consultation the retirement planning strategy session pick up the phone and give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one sixty two twenty now Rick I Know that my time is either spend at\nWork earning money or outside of work spending money how are we going to budget more effectively when every day is a Saturday and not only that the first several years of of retirement it might feel not only like a Saturday but like a vacation\nLet's talk about that for a moment when we come back here on your game plan for retirement let that sink in through the commercial break that every day is not only a Saturday but maybe a vacation day early\nOn in retirement how do we effectively budget plan and prepare for those additional expense when we come back you're on your game plan for tired of talking about how to\n[noise]\nThanks for listening to your game plan for retirement my name is Rick turkey and I'm the president and founder of the coastal financial planning group right here in Charleston and I believe in the income allocation model for the power and freedom of reliable retirement income I also\nBelieve that you deserve retirement on your terms for security and stability if you believe the same as part of this show how Mae Sai time available to

positive impact on your financial future the number to call his eight hundred for nine one six two two zero [noise]\nHe makes that opportunity and that offer available to you would know costs no obligation just for being a listener to this program oh you need to do is call eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nThat's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero or if you'd like to begin with the book that explains that income allocation you can also start there give a call request your copy of income application to get going eight hundred for nine one six two two zero now Rick we are at a pretty opportune moment in history if we look at the grand scheme of things the markets are at\nAll time highs are still hovering relatively close to them we've certainly come a very long way since the downturn in two thousand age we've tripled market value and taxes are at historically low point\nDoes this mean that it is actually a time to take advantage of to begin to identify and isolate pieces of our assets\nThat we will need to account for this income application and our retirement budget\nNeeds ... I Want to bring people back to a time that really wasn't that far away a time where people opened up their statements if they had the nerve to between two thousand and seven and two thousand nine\nI Want you to feel the same feeling that you did in your gut when that happened\nIt's not a good feeling it's the same feeling when you go out to Las Vegas for example and you're up on that blackjack table and you're just like rock and I can't hit anything wrong here everything's going good and then all of a sudden you look and you say\nWhere did that pilot chips go they're all gone [laughter] and so we're left holding nothing the thing is is the great singer Kenny Rogers used to seeing you need to know when to hold them and when to fold them\nAnd right now when you're up when you're playing on the houses money and the market is up why not peel a good portion of that money out\nAnd lock it in take home some profits let the rest of the money stay at risk if you want to\nThis is the basics for the income allocation model we take what we need to live off of and then the remainder we can take as much risk because we want versus taking it all and throwing it in to risk and\nHey if you want to do this\nAnd I'm going to throw out this disclaimer this is not an available investment but if you want to take all your money\nAnd go ... bad it on red or black well actually it is available you could go to Las Vegas and take your retirement fund and you could put it all on the roulette wheel and say I'm going to bet on red or black here on my future\nWould you be willing to do that would you be willing to take that risk in front of an odd in your favor to succeed my my luck Ricky lands on green [laughter] on green and you didn't pick the zero or double zero so the stock market I've often said this is\nLegalized gambling I mean we're gambling we are gambling on when the market's going to go up and when it's going to go down we all have to agree that it is going to do that we just don't know when so trying to time that\nIs a disaster plan just waiting to happen it's definitely something that I wouldn't want to thank my personal assets on for the remainder of my retirement years so\nWe need to do risk we need to take the profits off the table and the markets are up okay\nIn perspective what are they up from their up from two thousand and nine the bottom OK so everything's come back but if we look at it the break even point from the high point of two thousand and seven if we're talking about the u._s. stock market\nAbout twenty Thirteen so from twenty Thirteen\nTo president twenty Eighteen will say five years the markets are up okay the u._s. stock market is up as charted by the Dow or the U.S on the five hundred but we know the law of physics what goes up must come down\nAnd we just want to make sure that if it happens to us pre retirement in that retirement red zone\nOr in retirement it's going to affect us devastation only when we have to make sure that that money lasts as long as we needed to which is our long lifespan and retirement\nWe'd get ... we've heard that the market goes up over time but we know that it doesn't always go up there are certainly periods where we've had a rapid growth and expansion pack last ten years have been fantastic the period when the baby boomers began\nThose big contributions to their four O. one K. is the following Twenty years was one of the greatest bowl runs in market history\nEcon one oh one supply and demand when everybody's buying Wall Street investments prices go up but there have also been plenty of examples where the market has moved sideways for an extended period of time war has taken drastic downturns what if we're creating income during that period of time Rick\nAnd Pete what is okay\nYeah what you just hit the nail on the head what if we're drawing out of that pool of money so let's go back to the basic econ one oh one law of supply and demand when people start selling shares in the stock market and there's more less demand for buyers what happens to price\nGoes down doesn't it right so we are looking at potential\nWell for the largest population dynamics in the United states history the baby boom generation largest year to date\nMoving into retirement and what are they going to live off of the sale of those investments\nIn the markets so they have to spend it on their expenses and all those budgeting items we've been talking about today so let's make sure that we have a plan let's make sure that we have an income allocation plan we look at what we need to live off of our income needs\nAnd then we allocate money towards that income stream planning that we need to create and then secondly we look at our investments and we determine what future risks issues and opportunities do we have in our lifetimes remainder here in life and beyond if you want to do legacy planning\nAnd let's invest those assets properly\nBased on what your needs and wants of what you want that money to accomplish for you and your retirement years and beyond ... hundred for nine one six two two zero let's get you started in the process and let the value weight those risks issues and opportunities and let's get started on a little budgeting if you haven't ever done that before\nWe've talked about a lot here on the program covered a lot of ground about how we are going to need to predict an accommodate our lifestyle expenses throughout retirement\nWe can do that through the budgeting process but most people have overlooked this crucial step in understanding if the lump sum that they have saved and prepared and accumulated does prepare them\nTo make that transition into retirement\nOur lifestyle expenses vacations travel family protection legacy planning plans to maintain our independence our all accounted for through this income allocation\nBudgeting process we've talked about how important that is about determining success about things that we can do with money about calculating that retirement\nBudget including taxation inflation health care expenses how to reduce risk from market volatility through this specific structure or they plan income\nApplication and rip turkey has made the book that explains this income allocation available to you if you'd like to better understand how to structure the plan that addresses these issues and

much I don't know if that's the only thing are in [noise]\nI don't man my visiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible she's above\nAnd beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played ride along and without ahead Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what the purpose was um\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country an accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places you can't point out obvious\nDiscrepancy you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking\nChristie and balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush makers last week Trump was saying that she was credible\nAnd her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility to later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it
