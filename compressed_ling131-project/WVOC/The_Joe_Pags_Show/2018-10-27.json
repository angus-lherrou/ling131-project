Williams and and that running games got to carry the load I'm going to go with your miles William's on the defensive side of the ball at you know with Nick Harvey and Jay ... out he's got to have to do a great job safety and they're going to have to really play well the safety position to be able to stop some of those vertical routes of Tennessee last run\nBack here at the circle and BP station right across bluff road from William spray stadium as\nFans continue to get ready for tonight's homecoming match up South Carolina and Tennessee a seven thirty kick off about twenty minutes away on the SEC Network Christopher ... along with former game got coach Eric Wilson actually start keys to the game with the game kayaks have to do ... we've talked so much tonight\nWill my campus promised it Brian of Clinton the optics coordinators promised it and that is the increased dedication to the run we expect to see more of a running game especially early tonight\nYeah I think we expect to see that and I think that's got to be part of it a bigger overall plan to put the south Carolina all fenced in a position\nWhere they're doing things that are more uh in in terms of efficiency so one of the notes that I made it is looking at the first half we've also talked about starting slow and how South Carolina's really struggled in the first half this year and I think that run game is a really important part of it so\nHow are you going to make that first half one where you're converting first down you're getting first down your scoring touchdown run the ball effectively\nMake sure that your incorporating more quick screens or high percentage throws to the parameters and getting your play makers in one on one situations and those are guys like Brian Edwards debo Samuel shy Smith those guys can all make plays in space\nSo it's not always about obviously want to take our shots vertically but it's also about\nWe've got to give those guys one on one opportunities to make plays sometimes down the field but sometimes it's in space and let them be the guy and go get your ten or Fifteen yard so be efficient there and then do your job you know this is we talked about drop passes and and Bentley throw interceptions inside the tent yard line\nThese guys have got to stop press and they gotta stop worrying about everything around them and just focus on what's in front of them if I Do my job you do your job everybody does their job were good enough to beat this football team this week so that's one of the big things I think the other thing is third down efficiency if\nYou look at South Carolina and the games they've won they've been positive on third down if you look at the games where they've struggled last they've been bad on third down there were two for nine and third down efficiency last game against Texas Pan Am so they've got to do a better job of sustaining Dr keeping the ball moving converting third downs\nAnd then even though we say this every game it's true they've got to win the turnover battle they can't turn the ball over and and not get the ball back again they were negative too on turnovers against acts of saying I'm last week and it hurt him\nWe've talked so much tonight about the balls off into line now the single life tackling the fact that they've struggled to protect your ... over the course of the season I haven't talked so much about the game packed up and ship line that they haven't shined but they haven't gotten the spotlight for problems either\nNo I mean there are very solid group I mean how many years if we had were we've said the quarter back you know bally's running for his wife or whatever this is the most solid off into blind group that I've seen of South Carolina a long time they're now they're not Alabama they're not going to line up in in Reno wrote grade you off the ball for five yards every time\nThey're very good and brass protection they do a good job getting the body on a body in the run game\nI think that rhyme and Clemens got to do some scheming in terms of how you run the ball we're not going to just bulldoze people off but you can do things you can motion of you know place them too tight and sets or take the tide in late I'm wide\nBring him in and let him be an extra block or on the back side so that you can get numbers in the box because these guys are good enough up front that we can get a body on a body and run it if we got the number of right\nAnd why we're talking about ... players we should again talk about park or a white because he's been a huge ... force not only in this series because he had three key feel goals last year in the game in Knoxville but also all season long when the game Cox had needed three points in lined up he's given the ...\nHas in the wind is going to be a big factor in the kicking game tonight too so that'll be interesting to see how that plays out if you're sitting there or you know on the other side of the of the steel driving in and you're looking at a forty eight yard field goal versus a fourth in three\nDo you go for it knowing that the winds swirling and it's going to impact some of those longer kicks that might usually beginnings or at least high percentage kicks\nYeah I'm looking for the flack stack can't really make them out to see exactly which way in that stadium it's often different than outside the stadium as far as which way the wind is moving\nAnd even the entire time we've been out here in the wind is really been moving from different directions it's kind of whipping around it's not really is a static when that's kind of always coming from the same place\nThat's going to be tough for everyone to judge tonight on both teams no doubt about it when we come back we'll talk a little bit more about defensive cheese to the game for South Carolina let's get a quick look though at the SEC scoreboard before we take a break because as we told you earlier today was bandied beating Arkansas the common or get their first S. E. C. when\nOf the season and they have found their running back and they're running game ...\nOn with a hundred Seventy two yards rushing three touchdowns earlier today against the razorbacks with a gun oh for the SEC so far ... under Chad or\nMr Chad more thank you Chad more so I was about to say Chad Kelly because he was on my mind earlier this week\nGeorgia and Florida that top ten match up in the match up for the top spot in the SEC east it goes to the bulldogs again this season Georgia wins thirty six Seventeen the bulldogs out scoring Florida Thirteen to three in the final period Andy in Columbia, Missouri Missoula continues to lead Kentucky the\nWildcats would have had a probably a gained would have decided the SEC east against Georgia next week the Wildcats are going to have to make some hay here in Colombia and these final four minutes or so to make that ball game count they do have the football they are driving but they are deep and their own territory right now again about four minutes to play in that ball game\nMost do leading Kentucky\nFourteen to nine and just under way in stark they'll eat is Texas ... at Mississippi State no scored there when we come back here and I well I've just been chipped keys to the game South Carolina facing Tennessee one of the game I have to do defensively against the balls tonight will tell you is our best game coverage returns in just a moment\nWhen you want the best game coverage tune it hear news radio five sixty W we'll see\nI Can't believe he sold our house so quickly now do you have any recommendations and moving company I only recommend streamlined to my clients\nOwned companies have been in business for a hundred and twenty five years and you can't beat that has to my service\nIn prices may do background checks and they can feel faith on who's in your home\nAnd is an ... movie refined sounds worse\nLooking up at Smith brain Dan\nThis is a ... minute Clinton and it is my favorite time of the year it's time for football and that means time to tailgate come see us at the meeting place it costs money and we guarantee the he will have the most popular tailgate at the stadium she's from great steaks read chicken hamburger patties hotdogs and are delicious Kelly and don't forget our\nOwn Kaufman's onion sausage can't you just tasted\nGovernment's been eaten by the French is meeting the Midland\nScary David went in and I decided to upgrade our countertops we look for a company with a great selection great prices\nAnd one of the prides itself on installation in customer service we found all that and more with lifetime Kevin countertops I can tell you this if you can't find exactly what you're looking for a while you're there and that's rare they'll find it for you\nThey cut and install you're kind of jobs they don't follow it out to a third party contractor they do it all was Sharon's on the front of you to run in Colombia and shaping run in shape and granted marble courts courtside they've got it all seem on Facebook had lifetime Kevin countertops or call seven seven to twenty to twenty\nIt's hammer time an eighty four lumber where you're building outdoor and design ... lumber helps pros Andy I wires nail oh their projects stopped by any number of nine thirty one east main street in Lexington ... three three five nine forty four eighty four ready\nTo ride the boys being boys going to go to the area when you\n\nType sixties W.
