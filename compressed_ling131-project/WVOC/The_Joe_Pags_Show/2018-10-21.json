I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\nWhat was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour mother in law was really going to take the stuff\nI he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack us they'll tell lies about it obviously it would have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up\nBut but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law to do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what hair of the trade um\nHe really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this\nUm it it is so much bigger than any of us but that's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and\nIf we have to take a couple of planes going on here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think the country and hadn't been the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA disagree with that as Laura Trump or husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen\nOr because you said it was nowhere near I mean you expect to the the media would come after the electric come after you does but not like this and I asked him this was this completely unexpected he said no\nI Know that they would want to go hard on me to go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I'd made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday to lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this so\nWhat what was when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I'm actually still for a portion of the campaign working\nAt my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to to work there because I Would be\nAll different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know when he said right arm that that was it it it wasn't very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn child\nI mean it's the talk about it is a it is\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to became president that he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end so\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nI Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband her father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate\nFor Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who's doing an incredible job in working with your with your father in law of very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist is going to war\nYou look at places like Michigan or Debbie Stabenow was been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get that show that Israel's seat this really is going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now\nIn the country to get off the reruns and go vote for this really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you're right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful I Will be on your day ironically in Michigan um they do still important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and not with a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to\nThink about what's going to happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted on by\nPresident and and really pushing the younger forward we can be so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that should shocking everybody to a degree that you knew not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote um\nIt it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty think came to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me half to get out and got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nDid run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious who's his wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there\nI mean there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is may him in a country could as horrific and you really do have people in this country because you've ...\nYou've got people who were actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nTo Florida last question I really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we go for great stations or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul and take the okay there knew or knew right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts and take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country that's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right known almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... I done junior the president's ... the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that crazy to me\nWell I don't know though that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the old words ... agree\nA lot of phone calls that a lot of phone calls during the week too but during the week it's more of a a on a morning show feel where I've got my news anchor results will pay the my ass I've got my board up I've got my daughter who's a screener\nOf the phone call Sam so we we have a good time and we have three or four different people interacting with all of you and I'm ... and we we sort of do it that way it's not going to be your typical talk show some check it out so you have Joe ... show was available where you are or were on a hundred twelve radio stations around the country so\nHopefully you'll see a bear oh you'll you'll get it where you are also a Newsmax TV Monday through friday at seven pm eastern time they take our our second hour of the show live a Monday through friday so makes used up either too so you've heard from the trumps\nUm you see that there's still this alleged blue wave going to happen although I truly believe that two or three Senate seats will will be added will be gained by the Republicans\nAnd the house is now up for grabs everybody but everybody's been saying the house is going to go is going to go left is going to go blue I'm not so sure man the cabinet bounce\nIs hurting Democrats big time a couple of days ago Dianne Feinstein who of course sat on the allegations from ah from lousy Ford for two months and then leads to the information including her name to the media or somebody in her in her office did or the lawyer for laws you forward that darn points I looked up with\nLeak that out there people on the left the center left the center right the center center they don't like the way the Democrats handle but here it's\nNot even a little bit\nAnd I think you're going to see a backlash because of that and people are starting to realize that we use high profile democratic candidates are by and large socialists ...\nThe story of climate guys know he used the of abortion doctors that was killing babies that were born alive\nAnd even a woman allegedly I'm In Vegas will lead you to be more ... who helped to raise money to get that film made about about comedy because no one talked about the struggles they had to get that done and much more we come back right here on the weekend [laughter] yeah he's the weekend with geo [noise]\n\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if it were a business degree to further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

says she's basically like a a Cherokee queen I mean what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never flabbergasted by that lengths to which I guess\nThe politics left will go to to try and unwind\nBlatant lives ... this is a woman who advanced her career by manufacturing a ... a Native American ancestry that has been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing the results of a test\nThat showed that she\nPossibly had Native American ancestry six to ten generations back\nBut that was based on a proxy of Native American blood line right in other words the the researcher used South American genetic markers as a some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really has this\nAncestry come on Joe this is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way to do was all about is what does this woman Native American than you are right and I do use ... as they're hoping and praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words he's Weiner then I'll ever be\nSite and in fact by a statistics that were quoted and none other than than New York times it turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes her less\n... ... ... in other words than the average I'm white American more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent who you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe trying to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty four hours at the least they even had to update that four hours later to say okay

Trump's you don't need a million dollars and apologized or help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm of a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the ... the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics\nBrings us exactly to the to this point in time and and it's and it and it I think so many people\nAre sick and tired of it I mean for the twenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama ah I've had all of these white progressive leftist shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel those all end and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown getting in there as well yes and I salute ... dot com due to read her blog will you do you see every machine does you're going to reduce showing your TV was used\nTo do an incredible investigative reporting I wanted to talk to about ... I didn't know what your judgment was doing turns out it was really hard to raise money\nFor this movie it's basically a movie about well it's actually called the trial of America's biggest serial killer I Believe this guy was America's biggest serial killer one show so much trouble to make a very interesting and very important story\nWell ah the bottom line is that they are radical abortion is in the Democratic party and on the left\nI Do not want to acknowledge the horrors that are committed in the name of so called reproductive choice and my attachment to the movie into the story goes back to two thousand eleven when almost nobody else was paying attention to the story I and I first blogged about the grand jury report\n\nI live in if you're not getting all three hours became commando show joined Kim stuff that's right head over to get\nKim Dotcom and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room

three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona some low there Tom\nBlow their Kim what's going on well I have a question\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah of ah a website that I have one son mine right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice\nAnd I've been toying with the idea of putting a check ups function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in and the question I Would have for you is\nIt is a beneficial but you ... you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as\nThe employment of people to support that are the questions in whatever you\nYou know oh it was awful yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd ah you know we put a chat function in in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment\nAre you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work because they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective ah clients would ask them then those are the three questions so I Would give the managers as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question\nThen there'll be she they had the to can to ensure that I've already given but of course are the ocean and Chris you look at those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got and here's the reason why I'm hesitating with that is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different shed depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function of may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like than desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nA yes or the the we do a ... been billed than we have another company building or another website all over again but but when the media but third tempting as telling me about that in this chat function\nI don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under ... as a part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought and things like that\nA is a jury able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad stuff here on the came commando show

would imagine we would talk about\nEric I appreciate ... hey bags how are you I mean I'm\nI'm living the dream but it's it's going great today I'm ... and we've got a big debates when I was you know it's going to be Ted Cruz speaking on a Robert ... golden himself ... for some reason I'm not sure why but that's going to happen in San Antonio tonight in that race is probably not as close as the media's pretending but we really can't take it for granted right\nAs he can't take any for things for granted people have to go out and they have to vote and then the the amount you I hear you know people say to me well my guy guys Trump he's on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't I think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nDo as a country where winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire at Fort Point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in history or a nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have um the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history\nA manufacturing is coming back to our nation for one k.'s or through the roof of small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were a year ago which is just created such a you know financial engine\nUm I mean we are doing so incredible that's before you start talking about you know prison reform when she needs to be done and opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs\nYou know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off by China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right\nRight well while America has the strongest economy that's ever had said who's winning this thing right and and that's what he promised the American people he was going to daily promise the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get used and they've used to the country and the people have to get out there and they have to get out and vote\n... Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump Jr absolutely right but I watch these races is very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country usually moves all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate ... the top one percent of the vast majority of the tax cut everybody else got nothing that's ally that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut in corporations will employers got tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them around about it\nHonestly they're truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty in politics again this is this an worlds right we're business people who are not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world\nThese people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean you look at the amount of small businesses in this country\nRight or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses to write all across our\nOur nation they're getting their pay Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he slashed regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... how the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment and history the lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\nDo you know this better name but you have a trade deal with with with China where if you send a product to them they would charge you twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent and terrorists right right where they can make the same product over there they can send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I I mean it's absolutely unbelievably we we over tax companies we over regulated you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre are that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean\nWe're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote if you have to realize the lies and deception that some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K.\nYou know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're not working two or three jobs and they're getting pay increases bullied me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national you it's interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go bows or give us raises millions more people go ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone\nBe slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty\nEmployees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada should no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're gonna do it but we made a deal do you use it no way we're going to do with them they made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back end how weird as\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world they were able to keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars\nHealthcare costs you know ... through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug\nUm legislation that roses drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you look at a right to try to look at so many of these different efforts and you know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves\nIs actually a

traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast\nI'm going to be out is that getting to handle the ticket and taking care of who's working on that\nIt is said there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations for the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people are still in the county but I think you're looking at adding additional\nPolling location and then I think there's going to be a consideration for if you are displaced or you can vote in another county and your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by then that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they well look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very didn't mind it so I think

was there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern tier oh Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but of a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting good tracks and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans\nUm other Hispanic like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country where I had been in Congress\nYellow hawk or the Israel I mean he is a endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is a prominent in the ... movement against Israel they say Israel genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great day you'd at one of those that\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem in Israel\nA tunnel and individual capitals so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make them headway and areas that may be a Republican wouldn't cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't if they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really aligned with the radical left a which is really a very hostile to Israel now\nWell he's ... he's like he's really he's also a part of freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government is also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants\nMedicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table you know it's interesting to me run in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy don't the day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic vote is not monolithic I mean in Florida\nYou know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida um and it's just different than I think what you would the impact is our California um and then of course in central Florida you know we've had a burgeoning population of people who are Puerto Rican I've been very involved in a lot of those issues I'm actually endorsed by the Congress", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Columbia", "day": "21"}
