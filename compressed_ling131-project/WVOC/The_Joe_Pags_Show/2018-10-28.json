Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code working on the tax playing with President Trump oh we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke and also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are ya\nHey I'm good thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI\nShows was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guy had a history of uh of problems you know a ... and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all of this but we do you know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to green how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lawn right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these postal facilities and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e fighters advice early on and said you know someone stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him a demographer bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... ... people did not called the guy who shut up the baseball practice and and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nStandard shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing state do you want to take some ground there's the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear\nHillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder and began to list we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen\nI mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nThe guy yeah that's exactly right and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is that the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe the right people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nBut I had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the Reagan Library\nAnd he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact that thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... you know lovingly and and they do love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point boy thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan\nPerhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that the ... the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes and you were like you you're\nYou're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow and all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes as a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no\nManufacturing stuff here again or promising gift to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and in in in a period where President Obama\n[noise]\nAll right so here's the deal is that if you are missing out on a commando park has what are you doing I mean come on we have commando on\nToo bad that it's all about like this week we uh we're talking about getting chipped and we have a podcast about making money was domain names and last week we did a southern girl cancer DNA detective about how you can get in there and see if you have cancer with any mutations are right now and how they're trying to actually cure cancer by looking at the end\nAnd then we'd have tech news today totally love that keeps you up to date tech news this week uh and Robert is joining us right now because Robert Byrd as the new title here in commando Lance yes and what is your son I don't\nKnow I was younger but then it went to a digital marketing and now it's the director of pod casting\nSay that you know what the Andrew there's hope\nThere what about in ... jealous of that title [laughter] and there's been an intern for Fifteen Years [laughter] wow yeah we're open at some point that he's going to really you know we have our fingers crossed that he's going to really apply himself mixture that would be good and so as the director pod casting what are you got for us\n[noise] well I wanted to kind of highlight as you said we've got our commando pod Cass Tech news this week tech news today but really what I wanted to highlight was\nUm our other ... so we have our history in the highway podcast which I mentioned before and this was an awesome pod cast\nUm hosted by ... worth of you know you have he does a great he does an awesome job the way he tells us stories um is just amazing he brings it to life he's just you know a big biker guy and he just tells you stories and uh and\nReally um like I said just really brings it to life and just really animated\nIt's right now as I listen to his podcast about the railroads yeah I have to tell you where are you know what I was sitting there on\nHer I guess you know it's it's part of my company I should listen to it to you know like it was one of those like reluctant listens and I still think I was fascinated by it I mean all the fun facts that he shares but his demeanor and the way that he tells a story\nYeah it really is all about the story telling with a with his podcast and\nIf you listen to it it's awesome history and the highway and then we got our cyber law podcast several are now um it's hosted by a attorney Steven Templar\nAnd Steven is a big time attorney I mean he's on he's the chair of the Internet of things for the American bar association I mean he's worked in Washington New York now he's in Florida yes\nYeah and his uh his ... his podcast about artificial intelligence and what it is how would how it works with machine learning how it works with with algorithms and how they're trying to get to know you as much as possible uh on line and your habits um it's just it's a fascinating part I guess the people he interviews are are also\nAnd you know Steven so hold belief I don't know if you've ever had the chance to actually speak with him about this topic but his whole believe is that we are putting all these gadgets around us without thinking about the ramifications and that we have this Internet of things we have artificial intelligence we have Facebook whatever may be\nAnd we buy all this stuff but we don't consider how it's really going to affect us he was actually the lead counsel I don't know if you remember on hello Barbie\nWhen the there's Barbie doll would go ahead and and talk to the kids your eye and then everything that the kids said was an unencrypted servers right so he was part of the reason why he probably was the reason why that now but tell how to go ahead and lock everything doubt\nYeah and in exactly that his part gas just kind of opens the doors and\nAnd just kind of a opens her mind so that um you know just thinking about those types of things\nAnd then our other a podcast we have as you've mentioned before the golden age of radio\nUm which I Am a super big fan of vintage radio shows I listen to them or on the way in and uh the golden Rachel age radio it's radio shows from the thirties the forties and fifties my personal favorite is yours truly Johnny Dollar listen to it I thought it really is really good um how\nHow do

you know five parts and we do we put a ball all five parts for each of those so yeah it's really good and then um you know we've had our starting line podcast which is something we're going to be um uh dedicating a little more to and\nAnd just kind of bringing 'em you know stories of fortune five hundred companies how they've started in\nLove I this is my favorite podcast okay because I interviewed a CEO this past week and he told me a story that his little neighborhood is but if it were you'll have to listen to the ... uh but he was telling me the story about how the like his main product\nWas in his trash cat I mean the company was in almost on the verge of bankruptcy and his main product was in the trash can\nCause he said it was never amount to anything and then somebody came and said we should look at this again he pulled it out and had the sweet tea stains all over it so anyway starting line as you can find all these you can find all these pod cast over a pod net

Fox News after Saturday's deadly synagogue massacre Pittsburgh Mayor Bill judo promising will get\nAh ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting but it's still Margot bomber the make America great again bummer which was disgusted\nReporting\nThe bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him the smog bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the\nNews as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard\nYou know he's also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American his first name as Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well as all sort of reports that he's a talent in Filipino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of him in in\nSelf defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is\nSo the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced there were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs\nTo people we return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nAnd I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou if you were a make America great again hat you're a target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting\nThat's okay it's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is well correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example under example of that but the media again playing the victim in fact\nJemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or ... over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give better not\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president in what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in at that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who've committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way to the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid and the media needs to learn it's job again\nThe job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw is not go there observing and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI'm going to take some false flag called ... Charlie go I'm I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm not a technical I'm All right\nOkay John Hi bushy use the guy from the he's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan um Institute in California great interview with him\nWhere we compare and contrast how Ronald Reagan on through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media\nAnd it was a much better than what's going on with Trump and then how Trump does it very very different styles both of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold and Ronald Reagan as a great president great leader thirty some odd years later whereas Trump is being treated as he's being treated\nSort of get that for ya I've got representative Kevin Brady you're hearing the president talk a lot about a new a new tax cut plan for the middle class in America is that tax cuts to point out or is that something different we break that down we talked about it makes you stick around for that I've got a ... that caravan\nWe've got that for you which is okay I\nDid it last minute I think on Thursday Wednesday or Thursday so it's okay we'll try to get you that also mark a lot or from a GOP we talked to him about traveling around with um with vice president Mike Pence\nAnd everybody Scaramucci the ... the communications director of the Trump Administration for eleven whole days he's got a new book out we'll talk to him as well your thoughts right now in the bomber the bombing suspect that is on the media coverage on the\nThe climate in America and look I think that the left is causing this because they're deathly afraid of what's going to happen and election day and by the left I mean the media the political ...\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie PT and others um ... is that when you walk up\nYou generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight\nThat you do that it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue that you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look [laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm which work through it um\nAnd it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get back on a ton of charges to\nDo it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nBut when I got pulled over and and you don't know what kind of cars have but when I get pulled over and it's often a I may have my hands are tending to I've got the inside light on a bit the window rolled down and I'm thinking of wherever it is the man or woman just walking up\nAnd without a doubt his agency is going to have to take some action to keep the people that county I'm safe and and that's the job\nWe appreciate him your thoughts on that one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty\nJoe ... dot com we're coming right back there\n[noise] you don't miss your chance to win the W.

he he was actually\nNot surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office and he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your\nSome of your policies and you know we we let the ban declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right\nHe purposely like looks for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news ... editor in Anacostia eats it up he does it every time you make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price\nI thought I thought we were going to have a rock Roach month I thought that would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nA ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on

right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to they ambushed them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to president so\nWhat's your thoughts on it looked if you went back anyway but if you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't gonna pull any punches just going to be very\nDirect you're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry and here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happen to me but you you got you got
