I I'm I'm okay\nWith the idea of ... starting today is Bentley wasn't a hundred percent if they truly believe that Jake was one hundred percent you play in your start in that is what you do is your starter he he started in\nTo ball games were you in one one against what is currently right now are the number of twelve team in the country\nUm so you start him if he's a hundred percent period um so yeah\nAnd coaching sure there were some decisions that were made that I don't necessarily agree with a I don't think those costs South Carolina the game um South Carolina yeah in theory mathematically had a chance to win late but that game was over as soon as I Am scored that last stuff down\nThere a garbage time touchdown by sock on put them in a position to get the onset kicked a to win it I I I I understand\nThe reputation precedes him in terms of will much champ I get it I Do and the idea that he doesn't have good quarterbacks but again he did\nRecruit will Greer I Believe so there is there is some level hitting coach him meeting coaching so who knows what would happen to be the coach didn't but you know there was that raw talent that he was able to identify with will Greer [noise] um yeah I think talk on it but again I also said soccer when I was out coached the second half\nSo maybe I'm agreeing with Ron more than I thought I was at the beginning but uh that's just the situation we find ourselves and let's go now to game Koch quarterback Jake Bentley who took this team to the end zone twice in the third quarter against a and M. tied the score but never thought the fight was over during the game\nOh no not at all I mean they're you know well coached team that's not going to just lay down um you know they they go through you know training during the summer and like ... and they ah they responded and um [noise]\nAnd we did too but and obviously they you know have their more points at the end of the game than us um and that was just reading knowing that we battled back and\nAnd fall hard and and still came up short um [noise] but other great team and a thought we responded well but I Need to ah need to come out and play better [noise]\nDrinking the first south when you have some rough moments with some of 'em miss passes and the interception an offense started going\nThat time to have more of a negative effect on your cost of\nA [noise] a nice life I mean that's really the way that\nThat I've always been been brought up as you can't worry about outside influences um you know the people are going to try to come out to each and every way but you got to focus on what you believe in and and surround yourself\nI'm great people let me and my teammates every one of them came up to me to send to have my back and and you know keep my head up and just get through it and and so I say the the support my teammates had the biggest impact um [noise] you know obviously it's a\nYou know disappointing to to hear that from the fans but I mean they just want they just want to win too and um so do I have enough support from my teammates and to see them a rally rally for me and everything was or was it was great for me to say\nJake where did you do or what is the ... do differently in the third quarter what started clicking and what started working to support to turn around [noise] um\nYeah I think we just executed better um you know started his some big place um started started to run the ball a little bit better um you know in it and it doesn't the first half was just you know self inflicted stuff was missing and throw or [noise]\nOr you know dropping something are missing a block or just just things here and there that just you know can happen and obviously can't throw interceptions the red zone I'm the kind of the big thing that stands out but I think we're just a kind of said enough is enough and and I knew we had to go out there and play better\nJay keep coming a lot this year and talked about the drop passes and you've taken the blame but is there ever been a time where it's you've talked to receive and said look as I mean you don't have to say to us but have you ever talk to them and said I Can't do my job if you guys don't years\nBecause they no absolutely not they know that that I'm gonna keep doing it to him and I got all the faith in the world um\nYou know maybe it it's it's something that we as a group gotta work on a practice\nWho knows what the inconsistency what it'll be like when you play Tennessee you play Tennessee at home before going on the road against Ole Miss Florida home Chattanooga at Clemson and at this point I think pops it is imperative\nThat the powers that be at the University of South Carolina schedule a game a twelve game to make up for Marshall\nYeah that's most likely going to be the scenario going up or down to stretch a we're going to need that ah that that game to make that six game are\nThought maybe if it best case scenario for probably make that seven game unless we just go on a unbelievable a streak of being able to put everything together and being consistent and showed a consistency that consistency that we haven't been able to show the throughout the season so it's going to be a um a rough go as we are close out their season\nOr to get to that that that ah six came when I Believe in a you know we're gonna have to schedule that game to to to get in there give us an extra month of practice and uh uh get us a a bowl game that we hope is not Birmingham\n[laughter]\nPoor Birmingham I'm heck I think Caroline advance would take Birmingham at this point actually I Would like to run a poem or a\n... I don't think they'd probably vote out it and I'm going to run a poll on Twitter\nWould you rather get to a ball game and it'd be Birmingham or just go five\nAnd seven and call it a year and they were ... or five and six legitimately what Carolina fans want because I said if South Carolina's fighting for six when it's not worth it at all and now you know you'd you'd make\nEnds on that that that that bowl game I'll tell you a interesting story because they are the two thousand or a four season when we had the big\nBrawl with crime yeah we were we were ... that was absolutely Clemson winning that game became bowl eligible\nWait hold on hold on two thousand four say that again about Clinton said again that that when ...\nWhen made him a shock that last\nOne of the season however soda bowl matchup came out we beat us being well as we were still in a pretty good seat we I think we were scheduled to go to what was formerly at the gator bowl or whatever\nUm if ... if we really pride over all those lower tripled come to a middle terrible and ah they were scheduled to go to that one that was still being held out in Boise micro\nThe tent is able to dream bono potato bowl or some of the Idaho potatoes the famous I Hope yeah it'll so it was banned that recommended we give up our bowl games you know what I'm saying it was pretty easy for them to make that decision you know yeah we'll get we'll give up our ... yeah so\nBut yeah that that was funny but uh no I I think that was probably the right decision with uh with what they what went down that day but yeah yeah that that it just makes it interesting though again that you know needing to six game to get to that but a bowl level but ah it's gonna be interesting go down the stretch\nYeah it is and I I mean I'd love to hear more about that 'cause I remember that game pretty well a lot of fans do I I I think it took a while but you know as a way in the rearview mirror now if you really think that in turn out the fans that are coming out now ... may you know a lot of them weren't even alive than Thirteen Years old sometimes or we'll\nGet more into down the stretch looking ahead South Carolina going into a by week three and three on the season after last today the number twenty ... twenty six twenty three what that means for the future with the rivalry quote unquote with am you're listening to the best game caught coverage news radio five sixty WTO say\nYou're listening to the best coverage on news radio five sixty Silvio see [noise]\nLong time in South Carolina had\nBeen some convenience stores are my eyes is a competition by giving you a free I mean that's right very I just like any Eighteen factor beer\nAnd get a brief stint pound bag of ice the chili down in the convenience stores are your tailgating headquarters with everything you need for the big game and right now you'll get a ... purchase of any hazing back here one bag for customer per day please watery eyes does come up\nHere that crystal clear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters in service to maintained by crystal pools L.

I Am Tim Frisbee eighty nine drinking find pops we were talking a little bit where the break about three and three is where South Carolina stands right now and you have to look at this team for what they are not what you thought there will be before\nSeason um and how this season\nIs beginning to take shape which is a very inconsistent type team that you can't really pin down what exactly are they gonna do week to week or what they're going to be like when it comes to ... production is it going to be a coastal kind of day is going to be a Vanderbilt kind of de Missouri kind a day or is it going to be a\nBy the way those ... three wins or is it going to be a Georgia candidate Kentucky or a text saying them kinda day um when it comes to ... five straight to the Aggies we talked about it during the break that a lot of that the tone was set in two thousand fourteen when you got dropped by um I'm In that opener\nIn two thousand fourteen two thousand Fifteen that team actually gave me and him quite a run\nDown there Kyle Field in their first trip ever to Kyle Field last year ... and perfect position to win that game down there the offensive line just let them get blitzkrieg and the fourth quarter today's game you know you had your Kansas you just didn't put it together also very ...\nTo see jumbo Fisher coaching on the sidelines Williams rice um it was still I still can't really believe it that he's at Texas a and M. and not Florida State and I still just a weird feeling for me but this isn't you know I agree with all all of you who yelled ... radio when we went to break this is not a rivalry\nUm these two days later there every year it's not a robbery and\nUh you got to win a game to make it worth interesting are worthwhile and interesting so\nBut South Carolina five straight lost and they lose twenty six twenty three today as we put a bone that Jake Bentley played well in the third quarter in the fourth quarter didn't play well in the first half defense played well in the first half not in the fourth quarter say you couldn't really string together an entire performance again\nAnd your three and three with Tennessee they won't be coming off a win against all burned they did beat all burned today but Tennessee will have a game next Saturday I'm\nAs they are trying to turn things around or Jeremy Pruitt and the tendency South Carolina game is usually pretty close so we have a weekend between as a bit of a buffer but looking ahead to Tennessee pops what are you looking for if you watched any a tendency to day where where do some things cannot go Tennessee has the edge over the game talks in certain areas well\nAgain um I don't think there is no there as necessarily a up as powerful a running team as the rest of the teams that we face the last two so far or in the SEC so uh they're passing game is pretty good though\nUm and they're able to you know piece a few things together or things that they obviously they have some liabilities on the fence and some um office officer then efficiency\nBut we don't know what we're going to get either so it could be you know that that's part of the problem here so we can go either way depending on what team of our shows up in Williams price in two weeks so\nNear each county Tennessee or South Carolina there while they\nHad a ... that's both of our two yeah what kind of a kind of mirror images at this point other than where we were able to ... what are the same exact records right\nThrough the ... area and three so yeah kind of mirror images\nUsed to say that about Kentucky but again there another one of those teams that will be those five years in a row now too so now you've got Texas a and M.

connect with a syrup payload yes that Sarah Palin the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee\nFor vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and and I show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and or do you hope you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream and watch it because the scenery behind her as beautiful in Alaska but to lose ... boys and girls would serve village there how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole for Black Friday because people know I was actually on this was unfolding on me or live you're listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said heights or a pale in a bigger kids up and dropping kids often and I'm listening just want to see a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise\n[laughter] to\nGo back and forth and when I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and you get along so thank you for doing that and it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening I don't know what I'm trying to verify me\nWhile I tried to verify it a few ways when I got the email back from sir appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll let's just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to go to the state you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all these button to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out because you brush the boat you took my first time in ... her but you know say that's her that's now you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDid the people of Alaska except that excuse\n[noise] no and even\nThere from her write in campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave his daughter the job when he was elected\nGovernor up here right there on charming and I ran against him and defeated him right at least got and that's how we had stayed in the sense 'cause man once you're in\nAnd you have a special interest from around the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm irrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she said he good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about like of course it is and whether either good matter\nYet I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles running very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested it outright set on friday\nThat she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you that you are you like was it up and I circuit court of appeals at all ... of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going to write in my Mother's Day until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you so I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court and the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nThe the um the law issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nExactly right and Joe I'm breath because nobody else was talking about that next year I'm what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the nights circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit outta\nFrancisco right you know it talked about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court sixty million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest the eleventh and they are only serving thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why\nWe don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so for me to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous and the other thing is that\nThe Trump you know President

her the word I had no clue but she lives in my show every day and and I guess they hit the right buttons that one day and getting that anonymous strange a message on Facebook\nEnded up getting the interviewing and hopefully we'll have run again and again and again um I Do hope she runs that of Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski showed\nThat she is not who she told Alaska she would be when she said she'd be a Republican there is no reason for any Republican or anybody who's a conservative a traditional American values person to say no to Brett Kavanaugh uncorroborated or allegations don't count\nI'm innocent until proven guilty due process do count\nAnd and her no vote was a ridiculous move\nAnd hope that people of Alaska are smart enough to get harassed out of there as soon as they can it is a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty will have energy secretary Rick Perry on the program what's going on with the energy sector\nWhat about this liquefied natural gas that

again um banks I listen to your program while I Do have a nice to see that you got all the therapy\nThat are trying to make those were you when you're old trainer asked me what I wanted to talk about I mentioned that I read an article or some kind of go\nBy couldn't validate where the article came from Charlotte to change my question to in this election how do we check invalidate every person involved in counting the electorate ... votes to make sure they can corrupt the actual vote tallies that critical areas of our country\nWell allegedly there are checks and balances in place but I don't trust it a lot of his electronic voting um I I think ... is scary because you can hack these machines I don't know how to do it but but you know these these guys out there do know how to do it if you're going to happen during our government or hack into Facebook or\nActing to fill in the blank Yahoo um if you could do those things after you do a washing machine\nI Would think would be very hard um so I don't know how we guarantee that I got I got to tell you Doug I I've been voting for as long as I can remember and I can't tell you for sure that my vote counted every time I still go\nAnd I'll continue to go but we are leaving it to a very small number of people to validate something that that we all hope that they'll get right it's a great question I don't have a good answer\nPast you know all of a sudden we'll ask our whole box of votes were counted in critical elections and it's like\nWell I Can't live I I'm guessing that you're you might be referring to Minnesota where Al Franken won and he shouldn't have but suddenly there were votes that were somebody's car trunk you just don't make any\nAnd it's and it is it's a scary proposition although I bullied a little bit bother with the election results or twenty six feet ... feeling much about what that would have been the one but I think they let their guard down I ... to\nBuild up their guard down because they thought was going to win rather easily\nIt sounds like our votes Li do job\nBut it's a great question I don't think there's any guarantee\nOne eight hundred five zero one Seventy

great state of Wisconsin once that he is out there instead of the Feinstein team saying let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through this figure out what happened she instead says here's the far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah cats go and talk to her I mean I I don't think that's the right move either where are you on that\nNow I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh unless they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a center on jobs you're absolutely right last question on Kavanaugh notable until the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left is screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their mind for we're not going to kick them off the court 'cause we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell ... was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams cents a day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taken enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery shop from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett ... used supported the president as that all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and\nAnd do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that taxes are you an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you're a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care planning keep at ya\nFamilies who have their previous reduced twenty five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside to be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they are they're pushing a congressional Review Act reverse rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to sixty four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer Reno ability\nOkay so so you give people a greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plans because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates\nIn Wisconsin for example he health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost her mom and care plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year or they could get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I don't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back\nTo the Obamacare exchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the advance premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums caused because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to somebody you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something that just really reiterate that former senator if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection in terms of pre existing conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving\nThose individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't get the subsidies that can't afford they've been priced out of the bond care exchanges we're giving them an option to be asked to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because Romney one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects aren't preexisting condition which new Republican\nWants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nUh they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which ... which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts a tour his single payer\nGovernment run bureaucratic system that will ration care\nWill reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason it only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and it's still wouldn't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down the number thirty two trillion then realized how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson one last question are running and I always appreciate the access of the time and You're welcome anytime my friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned it briefly\nJust have a ... ... what we need to do is let people know what you know and what I Know that he's a bad guy he's a socialist he was a Nazi sympathizer when he was a kid a ... and the guys he just didn't know good guy so what can we stop him from spending his money no I don't want them to stop him from spending money that would be like telling us that we have to stop spending our money\nIn the U.S ...\nOh I don't know that I don't know\nAnd it's a good question um but again he's he's finally seeing activist group sees financing political action committees or or um political action commissions\nSo is he really is he really donating directly [noise]\nNo but yes just to give it\nThe way to armed with your mom [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhen when you were saying the land of Joe Heck dot com faceless would arrange to ram email all white they're also the live video stream [noise] it is the weekend with Joe packs led to have\nYou long for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some she just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever the financial markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler he's the managing director and senior vice president of investments ruby dreams that associates a Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJoe I'm great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points it due to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market as a slot machine and the way some I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about it can you point to one thing\nThat made this happen or as a a a conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it what's always interesting about the market is things that we know that are potential headwinds\nThe market looks at it stares at it shrug it off shrug it off and then suddenly it it it matters I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so what does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy\nSo that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or a photo if you will and in this regard so that's problematic we've had a few companies are pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still that's much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly that mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have an opinion it's Doug handler managing director senior vice president over at the gym and associates David opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state inflation target of two percent and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy as much stronger than it was\nWhen President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you you it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah\nThey want to just write so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where we have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they are they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable dug a I heard today somebody made mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump academy starts to tank and he's ... he didn't work all those the had tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational to think that politically people can make this happen\nAnd I that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um\nThink about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself right if you're right ... things go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay ah each dog Adler he's managing director of the vice president of a investments a regime that associates so as we watch this you know Obama when he was in office and I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great and and what it was doing great he said look I've read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubble bursting for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles gonna burst this can't continue like this\nDo you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again\nOr are we seeing that maybe you do get too big for its britches\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people you think it's a bull market or a bear market and they had an opinion based on how they feel about things but\nReally what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fed some deregulatory\nReform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive we have an economy that had been held back because of the consumer\nAnd then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty or high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high since Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence\nSo when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nProfound two things first one is\nDebt service so that's just simply what comes in in income\nOr into a household and then what goes out for ... like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay read at the lowest level the percentage of income go into debt services the lowest level since the mid seventies and household net worth it in this country such assets minus liabilities\nIt's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion\nAll time high yeah so if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\n... it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat\nThan they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash 'em but you know what the media does the media has to find if ... if it bleeds it leads and the stock market's bleeding right now that's where they are leading with it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
