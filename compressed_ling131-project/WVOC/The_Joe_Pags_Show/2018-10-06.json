{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "Just do your job just do your job on defense ate it gets tough but this may have been he's right one of the strangest games I've ever seen in terms of South Carolina football and you always seen some weird stuff like a hurricane against in the state\nYou saw Sunday game after a hurricane against Georgia you saw against the same Missouri team falling behind Seventeen nothing ... Missouri right number five come back and win outback bowl against Michigan outback ball against Michigan again um you know we've seen crazy stuff with South Carolina\nOn terms of come back some crazy weather and all this other stuff now the second game of the season has been delayed due to lightning and you know the ability to persevere and fight through it says a lot about the character of the team\nYeah and you you definitely definitely feel much better coming out on top on these crazy games the games where you have this craziness go on\nA you could be deflated twice deflated uh if you lose a game like this so I'm getting prepared and knowing that you had another must win game coming up next week it's better to come off that with a week or going into practice or let you know you want and you persevered or through the tough times just want to mention one thing and we'd be remiss if we didn't mention\nObviously Clemson South Carolina has a very very intense rivalry very heated or however uh you know Clinton had a tragedy last week at a young man that played on their championship team a CJ fuller uh that are passed away\nA and ... will let like to know we put all our our intensity rivalry aside when it comes to things like that with players because I\nI as a former player have a lot of a a former collapse of players that are friends of mine or vice versa\nOr we put all that aside you have to put all that stuff aside and get back to reality and you know we have personal uh people are affected by this tragedy so I'm just are we know our prayers are out there with the family friends teammates a former teammates up CJ full\nAbsolutely former coaches he was on that team that won the national championship had some big runs\nAgainst South Carolina when ... when that came across my phone on Wednesday night I had a double take I couldn't believe it or ... thoughts and prayers to to see James ... family and and the fuller family and what they're going through very sudden and very tragic for sure um and there's really no easy way to segue from that and yeah we will do it we can hear hunter\nRent fro getting some love and Clemson but um\nFor what it's worth South Carolina now gets ready to take on a Texas a and M. team that ah play Clemson tough than played Alabama tougher stretches um earlier in the season they're about to take on Kentucky I here and just a little while so\nIt doesn't matter which quarterback starts next week\n[noise] [noise] well um I think it matters a ... ... and a base level especially if we have one that's not healthy but if I if if it's if what if both are healthy I we think we both believe Bentley will get to start right or so in that sense it won't matter because we've got to put one of the one on the to the field or not\nAnd I believe like you said we run into any trouble we have somebody we can go to so uh we're going to see a lot like you said earlier from uh Texas a and M. tonight of how they perform against Kentucky we know how we performed against them we know some of the mistakes we made a and then we'll see what their strengths are versus what we have what we bring to the table\nYeah ... actually fans scout the team like sit down and watch this game\nAnd and and watch Texas a and M. don't just watch the football watch what goes on\nAround the field during the game and and get an idea of what aims good because they're playing a common opponent ... so you're going to know very quickly where you line up just in terms of team to team with Texas ... so there's a\n... for what it's worth I think South Carolina fans should be\nPositive heading into next week it's a fair game that's fun and and as I home three thirty so it's not new and you know it was mentioned that it maybe it maybe hotter next Saturday next Saturday the high right now is expected to be Seventy eight\nSo for what that's worth it it's just I don't think it's going to be this hot button Ninety five out there today and in that range is made it more and more humid so um it should be very comfortable according to the forecast right now that could change so good opportunity that game will end under the lights because of\nYou know the design and planning aging yeah so\nIt's a good opportunity for South Carolina at three thirty on SEC Network I Know it's not a night game but until you start winning games you're not going to get a night game so sorry um and it gives you a chance to get some positive momentum heading into the by week if South Carolina and again we're hypothetical ing here but sac on his foreign to heading into the by\nFeel a lot different than you did just this earlier this week to into with an injured mentally\nAbsolutely man that's what you yeah you put yourself into position to be successful\nOr that's what we did with another when today\nUh we can further that with a win against Texas a and M. but like I say it's a it's a week of planning so weak or preparation or it's a week of up seeing how your strengths match up against their weaknesses\nAnd what how you can cover some of your weaknesses against their strengths that's you know that's what this is about this is chess not checkers and we just you know we've got we've got to get it done come next Saturday\nAbsolutely in jumbo Fischer will make his first trip to\nWilliams price of the head coach or what should be fun for sure ... got to shore up that run deep in the way they can I'm not sure if there's a simple things we talked about that already on the program I think a lot of that goes to recruiting just getting some guys healthy and getting some guys back in\nThese rats will help down the road once you get those guys back who were\nComing off of injury in your deeper those positions than you probably would have been had they been healthy all the way through so there are some positive to do it I don't know if you're gonna get want him back by next week you could um Brian Edwards is still kind of nursing that ankle or so ... ... but he should be fine to go ride he goes just as\nNormal as you would after any game depot had a good game today as well South Carolina gets the wind thirty seven thirty five or Missouri now three and two on the season and we will find out what they look like next week who's gonna started quarterback as well South Carolina ... next Saturday three thirty on the edge of the

move across the street from the Capitol building where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court building work habanero was sworn in this evening as demonstrators gathered outside [noise]\nOr a very good friendly somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met bright cabin on\nAnybody and everybody else she said was at that party has refuted the quite\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel they say the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody so large incredible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and for something really did happen to her but it is incredible than it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know who was ousted was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand has\nEverybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two more whenever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets the help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible or allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible which he saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job I did a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know what you do to spin the bottle or is it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you can remember anything and then ah she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh putting her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put a mirror face\nNasheed admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on that panel calls are contacting her she spent six\nDave's calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I guess it did happen\nI wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it\nI don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to his cabinet are set up with no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer ... this is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh on mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking a gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nIncludes\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joins ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nWill continue to go into the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable then ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to come up with Harris it didn't\nMatter to any of these people he was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because the calls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point we'll vet I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process it is in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer\nHas said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's giving\nAnd Christie Ford only ... say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent\nFive days six days interviewing many more people came to who didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no cooperation there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter\nRead your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate ... ... ... people which means they're putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses it say a violent crew of idiots\nThat are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us I mean what's the mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nDemanded it happened

of people want to be heard on this confirmation process has been disgusting\nIt really has been enrolled it all started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize that Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the ranking member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad the letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody\nAnd her office or some lawyers somebody leaked the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was so no matter what you think of course the loves before she was a victim your two of the leftist politics\nEight hundred and five zero one Seventy and let me go to the phone line to see where you are on this 'cause we're either a country divided on a couple of our country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to an even centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still gonna be very close in the house but we have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political left let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn running and go hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and who\nWere in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in ... in ... sticking out stronger during the early process\nThat I'm even more upset with the Democrats and it didn't fit in their ... not a fan get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting this crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process thing that we have and the needs to be elected in ... the Korean court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venue for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just didn't want her to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but\nWhen the hearings started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you know all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think lower started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber in protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans and grassy ... I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this to be clear this room would be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is\nWhen they were breaking it on purpose us they really thought through putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are slide in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nHey Joe ... thank you very much for taking my call really you're at it uh I think the Democrats are dead and so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse ... rather not just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down they get it\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing a finger at a man next and healthy\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I call and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty of due process in this country now and I understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial\nGuys came here from the hip type [noise] crystal clear\nSplash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters and services and maintained by crystal pools ... when you're ready to make a splash you can trust crystal pools L.
