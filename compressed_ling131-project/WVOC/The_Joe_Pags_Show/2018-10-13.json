V. O. C. number to call nine seven eight WBRC nine seven eight nine eight six to\nJust ... I I'm Still struggling with this game a little bit but I Want to get the defensive side of things pops because South Carolina for all the problems they had all the ... in the first half\nIn the first half defensively it was maybe their best half of football we've seen this season not coastal Carolina\nYeah well the the defensive strategy was to uh to stop the run which uh they were able to bottle up pretty well they're in up to three quarters well for three ... three and a half three and three quarter of ...\nYeah they're able to bottle up the run that was a defensive strategy they're able to do that but uh uh the bottom line was time of possession of just ... just killed Caroline as far as keeping that defense on the field and then finally wearing them out whereas by the fourth quarter but in a sex and it was able to impose their will\nYeah they were and that's you know that's a lot of issues there that arise in that second half and late not ballgame in terms of the ... the defense and I want to get to the time out usage and all that other stuff that's why I said south bound without coached and the second half pro yeah um\nBut for the most part in the first half I felt pretty good about South Carolina I I I was talking to Rob yesterday on the run down and I said you know the thing that needs to improve\nFor South Carolina this week is their linebacker play line backer play has to be better this week they're linebackers keep getting pushed to the second and third level they've got a tack\nOff the snap of the ball and during the first half in the run game you saw South Carolina's linebackers Shariah green ... Williams and even TJ Brunson teeing off on that run game and just getting their heads and gaps and\nForcing trivia on Williams more to the outside and collapsing on him when he got there so I thought that was a pretty good sign for South Carolina's linebackers at least in the first half\nYeah yeah they ... they they play good assignment football are they able to get in the gaps they were able to uh uh a string\nA text say amount on runs a going up up going east and west\nSo that they did a good job and there was nothing really north and south in between the tackles a South Carolina was doing really well um but again like we said it I think it's more of a dead issue and more of a a a just a aware of that on the south Carolina defense that finally got to him not to mention like you said a\nJumbo Fisher is often was kind of playing chess while tree ... a trip buyers Robin said was playing checkers there in that fourth quarter and I just caught up to him at the end\nYeah it really did you know I wanted to make a quick comment um for from the caller earlier where they were talking about the whole thing with Jake Bentley there were several comments made about that the students section was booing Jake belly and I'm not trying to go to battle with you hear\nBush or he is a college kid yeah All right let's let's make sure that we have that first of all and second of all you students booming at him let's look at it from this perspective unless your lace them up and going out there and face in these big huge defenders shut your mouth\nI Would agree with you have to literally shut your mouth he Jake Bentley has put his heart and soul ... every time he goes out there and I'm Sorry you cannot question the young man's grid not one bit and then you're going to have people talking about they're gonna boo him he comes out and probably has the best\nOfficers quarter against an S. E. C. team in the past three seasons for South Carolina and people are still calling for the backup quarterback that's ridiculous here's here's what it is Rob\nHere's what it is and and it's the thing I\nI I say the students ... 'cause you know I'm I'm the guy you know free speech they can do whatever they want I Will say though you're right that half of them don't know I don't know what ... that's one\nNumber two when it comes to Jake Bentley here's where people and here's where I've gone to bat for the young man for three years now\nIs in two thousand and sixteen Sacramento is two and four they have no offensive identity they don't have good quarterback\nPlay he comes out against you mess and does this thing looks good the next week Tennessee in the middle of a downward spiral but he comes out and plays well and they win without Jake Bentley South Carolina does not go six and six that season\nLast year without Jake Bentley South Carolina's not winning ... games they're not winning the outback Boulder not winning the Louisiana Tech game they're not winning the game against Florida there they're not winning\nOr what other games did they win last year a Tennessee and the second half he played pretty well they're just games and ... and he may play Jake Bentley has been instrumental in you going from three wins in twenty Fifteen to nine wins and\nTwenty Seventeen and one other thing too it's not like we get to go to practice every day and they get only on us yeah here's the other thing too\nWill must champ is getting paid a lot of money to coach the game talk football team but he also knows that if he doesn't get winds was South Carolina he's not going to have a job\nOkay so if he could put store neck you out there and get him one more when he would do that\n... is a fifth year senior who barely beat out two seasons ago as a true fresh as a true freshman so stop with the ... stuff it makes no sense he came in and did what he was supposed to do he got he got them to win because ... was hurt\nGo back to the ... played sir I'm Sorry to be that way but then the students losing their mind with him and the stance that's that's ridiculous how ridiculous damage to the same thing to bring them back when as well um and and look what he's doing a cow by the way yeah\nSo here's here's the one thing and I'll get the cops on what he feels about this too but there's one more thing I've got to say before we move on and you can put it on record please at home go ahead and record this right now everyone's talking about the recruit coming in\nYou know who I'm Talking about ... yes everyone's talking about him here's the problem with South Carolina fans every time they get a highly recruited run\nTheir coach after some are some boos route a cut of an Jake and the first half and some drop balls or his fault just your thoughts are kind of mental toughness of leadership you showed to come back to play the way he did ...\nYou know he's a competitor he competes in front of eighty thousand people and um that positions gonna get criticized dislike my position as part of it and he understands it as much as anyone in the roof so do I so that's part of it and he bought his ass off and put us in the situation one football game\nJust along those lines will Jake and a slow start what uh I guess kind of speaks to him just continuing about on\nThe Memphis letters mental makeup and that's why a lot of respect by his teammates and has a respect to his coaching staff [noise]\nAh what was there ever a thought to put ... somebody and when ... when he was kind of sputtering and the first half and then you can't drive and do it with a with a good third quarter but was there ever thought that but ... not\nNot really we just we need to settle down a little bit and decision making in in a couple of balls here and there and but other than that we you know we knew he put us in a situation when the game to play better rounded\n\nKosher praise Jaycee horn during the week I did you play today\nI thought he played well replaced by both corner and nickel force in a ... a nice job force\n\nWill Brian met a couple of really a McClellan and met a couple of really good calls on the two point conversions and then on the flavor flicker can you tell us what Brian acquaintance thinking was on those place\nWell you know going into the game we felt like we needed a number one take some shots over the top what I thought well designed plays we gotta we gotta finish the boy\n... changes the whole collection of the game and if you finish its place but uh you know again I fall through the fleet for her was a good call we felt like when we got an ... you know fringe red zone that we're going to take take the shot there on that play which is well designed and Chevron stalking tomato fantastic play on Jake was under duress made an ice throw\nIn a to point place we both felt good about the the look we're gonna get made a nice nice for\n[noise] and that was well much chance at the Mike a lot of things thrown his way we have\nA that to cover excuse me we have that to cover and a lot more we'll talk about South Carolina's twenty six twenty three loss to the Texas a and an

Iran mountaineers Ron\nI I hate to use this word but it's probably the most um most gratifying when I can use for the vocabulary is there's still some residue from previous defenses\nThat don't really fit his mould maybe I don't know I maybe I make an excuse\nBut since two thousand sixteen I feel like it's been given as much as they won't inside the twenties but then inside the twenty bow up and make a stand you know what I mean so\nMaybe that has allowed to do with it um your thoughts uh we we ... I kind of crowned Jaycee horn last week going back to a thinking back to what I said last week I I kind of ground him a little bit I thought he played well but it ... on the defensive side we mentioned on the field for a while but not all three levels I feel like the defense played very well today yeah they did pretty\nWell on it and you have younger guys on defense what they tend to do is a player zone or to protect a the the younger guys from the decision a lot of decision making and uh you know the\nWas able to recognize that in a kind of pick that apart\nOr towards the end of the game or you saw some of the big possessions debate third down conversions came a ... South Carolina was in his own there at the end of the game and and guys are just a finding the gaps in his own mom was finding them and we bam bam down to fail and able to consistently or get first downs and continue to eat up a clock\nThat quarter post game show nine Seventy WBRC the number to call nine seven eight nine eight six to we've got Jim on the line Jim what's up man\n... start with the like versus going to or what I think going in and given the fact that Jake is struggling big games but I'm ... now that's like you could have made that argument either way I don't think anybody would while either should've started\nBut having said that even though they struggle in the first day of you got some poor throws the yeah the very very costly and it's that and in the end zone\nJay plate good enough to ah absolutely believe that\nAnd the the draw passes I don't think I've ever seen that game where they played a bigger role I mean these were not well short but these were huge huge missed opportunity some you know may have been a couple of ... ... ...\n... the couple hey I'm you know he had a raw late in the game and we were we were down not last meaning and uh you know he wrote about about a twenty five yard game with the first ... and on about ...\nBut um I think in this particular game had we not had drugs like what do I think we warn the game and go to pay us bring our yard\nYeah I mean that's that's you're you're ... you're probably right Jim\nI'm and I agree the one the one throw by the way if you're not remembering a that Jim was talking about the shy Smith was actually on that second to last drive it was a flare out to the left side and the ball was a little low but it was in\nShy hands as he goes to gather any kind of drops it between his legs and that was a that was a big drop I mean that was a\n... or just a\n[noise] high magnitude kind of moment that you drop the ball and shy Smith of the most part up until this year they're pretty sure handed the drops did have a lot to do with it today\nYeah yeah well if it drops were big uh again receiving corps not getting even a nose drops ... they're not getting much separation is not like they're a wide open um you know uh the one big drop by ... and I said to somebody earlier\nBeetles usually not a guy you go to on those uh uh you know does fly patterns those long patterns he's more of a you know ... or catching make yards after the catch kinda guy\nOr do you don't really see them strike really deep but why not ... that's just you know I'm just saying that's been his style right uh but uh that doesn't preclude them from being able to catch a ball like that you know that's right and the bread basket a lot of people were saying well it could have been the sun or the shadows\nThey sending out his arm in Texas\nAnd they didn't have a problem with his son in shadow so they you know they were making caches so it wasn't a center shadows it was just these guys are ... you know ... making some big drops a on a inexplicably and don't know why that is something that needs to be talked about in the receiver room but ah yeah big drops today\nYeah and also it goes back to what's interesting as they say they had his arm penned up against ... right through both hands so [laughter] yeah I don't think that it's not excuse I I don't think that's the case Bobby is on with us on the fourth quarter post game show body what's on your mind man\nHey fellas thanks for having me on you know I I Love listening to your show after the game you're not pumpkin sunshine on like some places\nLook the one thing I don't want to have happen I I go back to coach barrier getting mad at the fans were clapping or after I think it was that over and game yeah no I I'm done with moral victories you know what I mean\nThere's you know excuse no excuse it all to have the continuous drops and the receivers that have Jake Bentley understand he's not a hundred percent throw such a terrible passed down there in the end zone for an interception\nThere's no excuse to be backed up off the receiver ten yards Fifteen yards and give kill him\nOn just a wide open lane and my God have we covered that tied in yet I mean I Do run I Would\nYeah I Am so sick of seeing our defense kid up like there to Miami Hurricanes\nIn the Nineteen eighties celebrate okay make a stop before you get up and celebrate I mean it's so ridiculous and there they were in the fourth quarter we all knew it was coming\nYou know that a you know I'm just going to ruin it right down our throats and then mix in a couple opportunistic throws do wide open receivers including tied in ... and I I'm just so frustrated with the inability to be prepared for a big spot and this one was not all alone Jake now you got the ball rolling with that interception\nBut you know you guys are covered it wide receivers nobody I see what I'm so sick and tired of hearing about all the talent we allegedly have on all since\nWe do not have good receivers okay that I mean to prove his into putting\nThis is not a one game or two game thing they don't call season they don't get open and they drop balls when they are open are running backs or nobody okay we heard all this sunshine about Tyson Williams and Rico down there nobody\nOkay and Jake is what he is and we got scorn who played the game last week I thought but obviously either walk on backup so shows I'm just a\n... event but I just hope this doesn't over the course of the we get turned into some kind of moral victory this was an inexcusable loss\nUm feel free to use our couch anytime a [laughter] you know a lot of that I agree with I I um I don't even know where to start on that well\nWell there's no like you said there are no moral victory in this uh you know then which goes back to my comment that uh you know they basically in that fourth quarter playing chess while we're playing checkers and now that's that's all of a ... that's where all Robinson ... defense there\nUh you've got to be able to counter those move again that tied in how many yards at the end up with today stormed burger or a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty it was somewhere around there was no seven catches I'll get that number has it so yeah he was never a adjusted for a in a defensive scheme\nOr in you know that that that's just that's just commonsense stuff now you have to be able to make those adjustments\nSeven catches a hundred and forty five yard for Jay ... a lot to get into will get into Bobby's call a little bit more on the other side you're listening to
