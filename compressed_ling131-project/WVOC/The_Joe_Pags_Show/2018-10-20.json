of a larger caravan hoping to eventually get to the U.S turned around and headed back to Honduras\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that\nNobody one what was the mega millions or was it the power I don't know do what it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine\nThat would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren\nElizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian\nWhy am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes\nIf it's okay for them it's okay for me she's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to school for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first\nWoman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\nShe's been make humans clean but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian\nSo the president like he's apt to has been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls are both gone is I think it's funny as hell people were offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou know like Rachel does all who's white\nLike Sean King who's white\nYou know they're both pretending to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no it doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around and he said do a DNA test if you could prove to be the urine Indian or give a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess secretly does a DNA\nTest gets the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write those big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four it's Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and corrected and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American made of blood\nBoth the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's affected me making it up as a fact\nShe's not America in American indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself ...\n\nShe is so not American indian but the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nWhen they did bad some left wing cable news outlet\nCalled the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nJerry the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which we live\nGuy let that sink in that\nAnytime you go through this week figuring that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week it was meant to yourselves while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story any ... any of us didn't even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this\nNobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up again\nAnd you ask yourself what she thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a package parity about they call it Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you really are with my packs parodies I take a song but you know and love and I ruined it by changing the wars in singing it\nAbout a current event Pocahontas where we come back
