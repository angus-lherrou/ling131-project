going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen\nAnd so they should just be honest about what this says this is about the strike destroying a man's life because he's he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it\nAmericans are smart and they're watching this process\nPeople are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat is due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the

her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six vetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats ... really nervous today because you're caught between\nA ... on one hand your Democratic Party

who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell it ever having a kind of washing either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell you that there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in

Seventeen that Brett Kavanaugh\nPusher on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh march judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else does she said was that the party has refuted the claim\nWell Christie lousy Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody sergeant credible credible witness credible which is actually untrue she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand\nHas everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets they'll CDs and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that's a appointed delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or is it was ... ... they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then uh she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it too much Kavanaugh said you know there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity this Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party you went to ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for the full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes he's got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker growth because the calls all Spartacus but he's an admitted Grover what are your Fifteen he grow up to a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that he meant that\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's given\nAnd received Ford only vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people and came to ... didn't come to ... offer of evidence that there is no cooperation there is nothing\nOr here\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\n... people which means are putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us would listen to the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting there's still attempting these days are rapists serial rapists at about a rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting display their trying their best\nTo change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something or China\nOh man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now ... what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this\nI'm guaranteeing that you have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee every your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down where are you on this even if you're on the left or even a political you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who generally speaking doesn't agree with me or doesn't agree with Trump\nWhose daughter is getting married today\nAnd as the father of my daughters I'm with a [noise]\nHe's got to be at his daughter's wedding we

up to ... trolls just you know saying hateful things to be so again at Joe talk show a lot of people want to be heard um this confirmation process has been disgusting\nIt really has been enrolled it all really started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize you're dying Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh I'm In the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nSo no matter what you think of Christie lousy forward she was a victim your two of the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this because we're either a country divided or were country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans do\nGo to an even centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said sat at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but it'd be a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political ... let me go to the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nEnron and go hey I think lake lake is appropriate name thank you and\nWhere and paper that and I'm really disappointed in theory you know not taking that stronger during the early ...\nThat I'm even more upset with the Democrats and to fit in\nThe ... not a ... and get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting this crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process and that kind of in a needs to be elected the next the Korean court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture with a call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just didn't want her to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but\nWhen the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely do all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think globally started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and he's ... and his temperament is that it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans and grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second\nElections have consequences we won were in charge of this to be clear this room would be given interrupting\nThan it would ... would proper protocol is when they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nHey Joe ... thank you very much for taking my call really you're at it uh I think the Democrats are dead so now they're [laughter] they're getting worse every month they're just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down they get it\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning a trainer at a man makes being healthy\nAnd you got a list of the best shot if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of classes that very well rounded young man I\nCall and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but ice he he he's just a great guy and I hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have to cross in this country and down and understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial\n\n\nWe can we do have\nOne in five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com top of the hour we'll be Donald Trump junior about the midterms about Kavanaugh about about the good things happening in this country\nAs his father is the president of the United states that's right Donald Trump junior top of the hour right here on the weekend with Joe ... we go back to the bowl large and say hello and welcome to a Christie in Carson City Nevada Christie what's going on\nOh lots of stuff going on [laughter] you bet on TALK to me I just\nFind it very very hypocritical they were interviewing the man to be a fair and fair and honest person to get tied to print in court cases where we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he accused the baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we lack\nAuthentication bike to a doctor for may have then I felt it but there is nothing to do that with Kavanaugh\nRight if we let women like to come forward and it it kind of damage to finance reputation it's actually going to step back women testifying by decades um I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked\nAnd it was because of women that come forward I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly not now and the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's\nIt's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became that if she is a hard core Republican and and tried to explain to people what truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining\nThe person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotion why he's being attacked unjustly\n... you're going to be more correct ... facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen and then be junior Jews know going to be fair and and level headed about this oh I'm Sorry that that I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a server\nFiber and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder do you remember the details of what happened to you because this was lousy for doesn't remember anything does that mean you just all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every ...\nWhere she lives with me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I ... the single parent household with that there were six cats when\nI was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't how my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to lick me with one she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say I\nHad someone that was in that room when I got my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my aunt at gunpoint kind of my family when I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became ethically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember not pay that was your first day\nBut I Can't remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and men in my memory\nAnd I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate beta but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as I Know because I was in law enforcement and I know what ...\n... oh my God on her now she's\n... and I'm ... I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she says\nThe word we are going to use as credible to everybody that we talk to and we're going to force them to repeat credible because then the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but I agree with you and I and I said there's really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage about words and that's where I was I mean\nAnd I was attacked because I said that but still want to be I saw when I saw or heard what I heard and even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I I what what meal in a way it's how much I have personally been attacked\nBy ... survivors product holding back then because they allowed it to victimize that life of me away as I had a guy friends that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history ... I Would be doing a great disservice if I get\nI I agree we we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time\nWe met somebody who really gets it\nWe come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends bigger\nMessage indeed ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...
