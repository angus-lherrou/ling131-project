that's why it's constant so much is because we have to go into areas that are hard to get to and the people don't know if you're don't trust us don't understand it and that's the reason [noise] so you when you\nKind of showed me and he said how do I had to illustrate this on the radio and you show me about an inch inch and a half just picture a slot district you invest she'll came it used to pitch the trauma that TV commercials\nThey answer you know if you ask your grandmother how much salt to putting something should be just a pet so we're just really that close and I think rather than using that patch or that close symbol ... what they're saying now is it's a countdown around just on the final countdown\nHow many cases do we know many cases are are worldwide or how many new cases\nAre right now in twenty seven teams there were twenty two wild polio cases\nTwenty ... and all the billions of people in the world\nIn the world we are those ... those two countries were Afghanistan and Pakistan right now this year twenty Eighteen you're only Nineteen known cases that that I can just those two countries you have to go three years without any new cases before you can be declared\nPolio free okay so those are the two countries that were working on there was one country that is still we're waiting for that third year but so far our fingers crossed were good on that\nSo so you uh SCU collectively with wrote a rotary international are celebrating the polio world polio day with a rally and that's coming up on the twenty fourth\nWednesday the twenty fourth statehouse steps if you ... well not if you come please come there you go where red one o'clock will have some speakers and it's really just to celebrate what we're doing and to educate what we're doing\nSo that we can get the word out that we're almost polio free\nNow to me but a belt rotary international ... this is a rotary this this one of the initiatives of rotary tell me to me a little bit about about rotary international why that is such a a a passion button for for you folks\nRotary takes on different causes all the time and they took on this ... years ago because they saw the need for it right and they figured because we're a global organization this would be a perfect fit for us\nIt was so good in fact that bill and Melinda Gates foundation signed on to help us with this right and they do a two to one match up to fifty million dollars per year I'm Sorry fifty million fifty million\nTwo to one to to want to get so if I give a dollar today they'll give two dollars making us three of my math is not that\nFuzzy two to one match up to fifty million dollars per\nYear wow that's a lot of that that that's probably not enough but it obviously much needed\nFine he believes in it and yeah and we work with the\nWorld Health organization okay well so there are other people that have joined in with us to help us get rid of the dreadful disease\nShore and others now he does not say it doesn't exist because there are people who who still live with it every day so you were talking I Wanna make sure I understand too We're not talking about making you just go away won't exist it's new cases so no longer when we'll we'll young children be afflicted\nAnd we'll end exactly it's you know if you have it you have it you've always had it right and if you've been vaccinated you will never get it okay so we're talking about new cases right not people that are already\nHad her and I just want to make sure I understood that I was I was talking about the right thing so\nWe're talking with a with Mary Beth gas excuse me from a Rotary Club international about B been coming up on Wednesday at one o'clock in the state house stayed how stairs and the one we're reading come out and uh you know obviously the funding will be this way you're trying to raise money and awareness because you're gonna need that money thanks to bill and Melinda Gates is well\nExactly and we're not actually going to be collecting money if you want to give somebody will have a pot there that you can put some money hand but we're not asking for what we're asking for you to come celebrate\nThe fact that

it's a you know it's amazing what from Fifteen thousand new cases every year just in the u._s. do we know do and I don't know and you may not be um how prevalent it was all the way through I mean obviously it it it wasn't just us obviously not to the U.S affliction but\nIt it must have been quite profound and a lot of areas\nI'll tell you one fact that kind of surprised me in Nineteen sixteen there was a major polio outbreak in New York City that killed more than two thousand people\nIn Nineteen sixty Nineteen sixteen remembered Nineteen sixty New York that's a significant amount of population is not like it is a day kids\nRight and it I'm paralyzed about six thousand people that year so I I mean it's it's a big deal yeah and to get rid of it and to know that you're safe and you won't ever have to worry about that disease again it's a big deal\nRight and and you know I think and he's been educational for me as well I mean I think most people that he's heard polio we don't

and right after that she had told me a little previously before that\nI had seen her actually bring in I didn't see her until she was here but she had actually brought a vacuum cleaner all our stuff yeah about five blocks away from another place because somebody a drop her off to do one place you walk five blocks for that\nTo do the cleanup type work ... she needed a car so bad yeah and so\nThe

okay we're going to go ahead and mentioned it to their quiz and if you we did get an answer to that take that quiz last week mhm and so we're ready for a nice fresh tech to quiz that I felt like someone with more than likely get\nOkay\nHere is to question Baba owns a two thousand five forty to fifty four wheel drive\nAnd it was getting fourteen miles to the gallon and I stress that it was a full will drop bubble went into the woods on the opening day of deer season and it had been raining the day before and he almost got stuck in the mud up to his running boards but he's shifted into for driving got out\nHe did it out of the ... he did take it out for a drive but he was ... when he went out of the woods he was only getting eight miles to the gallon ...\nWhen a what happened to make him get that bad gas mileage\nAnd so if someone knows the answer to that you give us a call and that number again seven six eight six three five eight hundred John run before the before the show we were talking a little bit about diesels and your absolutely wonderful\nMm yeah well you work with them a lot what some of the things that you see on some of the diesel ... some of the more important things that people should do to keep them serviced and make them last summer 'cause I feel like myself I feel like\nThey will last a long time but maintenance is more important\nYeah I think nine well maybe eighty percent of the issues that they have are just lack of maintenance mhm I'm you know even even including ... and ... and now some models fail electric uh electronically of course which you can't prevent a lot of them fail just simply because of course there\nAre you know restricted with different things from the filter not being changed so definitely maintenance um you know of course it's so costly to repair and diesel you want to stay on top of the maintenance\nI'm an some models there's a lot of cooling issues and if you don't change the cooling in the proper intervals you can really really do some damage on those\nThat's what I was going to mention all changes and and cooling system repairs or it could be huge you'll wants to go to the phones and we'll pick up on that

Augusta David welcome to the ... so the auto show and what can we help you with\nYour morning I question for you about oil\nOkay great we love horses about motor all\nMy body ranchero for five years or\nSo and now I've been told that\nSynthetic bland is no longer available and there they had to go to Austin buddy wash already two dollars an hour after an end to sixty nine Ninety nine plus the spirit is markers perceived buried accurate and they're just trying to make money or\nThey are now it wasn't available that day [laughter]\nNo you know they they they said they're phasing out\nIndustrious phasing out synthetic\nDavid what type vehicles is again I Know you you may have mentioned\nOr treat our Thirteen grand caravan\nNow I'm not sure how John Ron feels on this but uh I Am at one time I was thinking that the semi synthetic motor all absolutely fine keep running it and everything or\nIf that's what they call for her to vehicle but I Am seeing where there are some benefits to the full synthetic oil or even in cases where they don't necessarily call for it and the owner's manual that vehicle does and if you go by you owner's manual\nIt'll say that you can use semi synthetic motor on\nBut the prices of the semi synthetic has come down tremendously to where you can get a full synthetic all change for somewhere around that rain sixty nine Ninety five is not an unusual price for it or in the price of thirty two is not an unusual for semi synthetic\nBut I Believe if I had a ... a a lighter model car like that\nAnd as long as we want them to run and there's so many intricate parts of the engine now that uh that depend on the motor also much some ... vehicles have bearable cam timing um there's time and change components the way if those all those components are lubricate it correctly\nIt makes the vehicle just last longer and semi synthetic old does a breakdown less uh under heat and that's one of the highest qualities of it is is it don't is it doesn't break down when it gets hot\nSo I lean toward I I like their idea actually I mean it's it's not a bad thing because more than likely they work on mostly later model vehicles went in and I'm classified twenty Thirteen Years later model be cool and uh and and I think it can be a huge benefit now shops should do a lot of vehicles that are um\nLike a Fifteen Twenty years old which those are still great cars I still think your ... what is semi synthetic go ahead and keep broaden it if one what you're running but would you want which I Believe one\nOf our question about right uh-huh ours ours told\nMe she has I added to that they will but and the oil is a synthetic ... and ... guarantee\nIf you if you're using if you can prove to them that you are using it consistently that they won't pay if you have any engine problems they will pay up to\nTwo thousand dollars based on either two to four dollars based on them out of that vehicle if you have any type of engine problems is that also accurate\nYes sir it is correct like you said there's two different tiers two different mileage intervals I'm so as long as you're in you know one or the other\nOne is the art order earlier but I Will tell you the best I Love the G product someone tell you that in the beginning we use a lot of the gene products I Love them but I Will tell you that if you use full synthetic in to change your all on time is going to be very very doubtful\nThat you have an issue to start with it because it is just the engines are built so well now anything can happen on any car so I don't want to say beyond a shadow of a doubt but if you use a good full synthetic or and change it or I Would say on that vehicle every five thousand miles would be fine\nUm it would be very unlikely if you had a major engine problem\nHairs or check her out a I'm a commercial probably are closer to our show aired three hundred and sixty or about ... uh-huh would you recommend\nThe circumstances the additives\nI Would personally just because like a year and said I like it um I think for the cost it's an added insurance to you um I personally run it and all my stuff so yes I Would\nThat David let me get like right though before you do is make sure I heard that right now did you say you had a twenty Thirteen and how many miles on it ...\n... these four\nWow whoa David how in the world can you draw that many miles\nWell I'm a taxi driver\nWow that is absolutely amazing what David\nDye average Shakespeare Saturday Val I'm over here\nWow that that is that is really good and that care of and that really holding up good for you there now\nYeah it is I I gotta match care aren't they on them so they everything's pretty much covered offered a job or I was I read it a good job on it", "show_name": "C&C
