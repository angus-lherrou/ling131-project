[laughter] but one thing I really\nFind it out we just scare credit in the garden so we talked a lot at our house museum but not that much our gardens and grounds there all day properly sit on fourteen acres consolidated of faith downtown in Colombia\nUm and one of those is to Robert ... gardens which is just beautiful and said we had a skill credit in the garden for\nMore than twenty I'm scared of rights and that sort of ... that it is and then to save your Sunday um on the ground out of the Robert ... and we've invited local artists families churches businesses just different organizations that come out and make some really creative ...\nGot a Harry Potter scare crowd there are some really cool or just didn't ones that were done by local artists I'm sort of courage people to come out bring the family um and just enjoy the gardens and hopefully we'll have nice fall weather\nSo far [laughter] or something [laughter] [noise] what other what other stuff he lives\nIn for two or three were quickly closing on ... or ... to Nineteen you know you move forward in history what is your meal besides events and things but how are you ... what are you looking to do you know in the in the future plan for history\nWe know anytime that our research was kind of come across new information I mean history is always changing of the sense that we find information that we didn't learn before so\nWe always have kind of projects that are in the work coming up we I'm often revise the doors that we go again if you've taken one of our walking tours before come back and take it again because we've often or corporate a new information into it and the famous historic houses how's museums every marriage there's always an information that's going in there and so\nI'm One project of it coming up as much as some of the top of civil rights leader here in Colombia\nUm we're going to be taking a look at that site and talking about how ... much Jessica Simpkins 'cause I Know you were hearing folks\nI Know what you're so she doesn't live here and so really needed is a\n... Michael ... what's his name ... trillion over ... just the offensive joke or it might go on\nWell anyway we're going to be taking a look at that site and doing some new exhibits and working there and so people will definitely be able to see that actually just had her deeply festival last month and so I'm at the next to play fast and we're going to be did not fight to the public so it's going to be an exciting time for us\nSo there's a lot more who funds historic Colombia and obviously do find ... society memberships and its member do you get any national funds in a local ... what are you guys get all the money to do\nTo um we're a nonprofit organization say we rely heavily on the ... community support so private donations from individuals businesses corporations\nBut I'm a member base our earned revenue through tours and events um but also we heavily rely on grants that we get from private foundations but also on a James mention them just because some guns\nUm site that is through a national grant national park services um we also um rely heavily on local government support so city of Columbia\nAnd Richland county um provide a good portion of our budget on which gets um primarily to manage the sites that are rich Lehman city at Richland county and city of Columbia and\nWhat I'm ... I'm not I don't care about exactly what it was rough number that it costs to maintain like either one maybe maybe all five properties just to just kind of wrap our heads around what kind of funds you actually need to operate a a a an agency\nYeah I mean if you think about all the different costs are going to managing a site like that for example we have to pay for the upkeep of the science themselves so for example you know I mean these are old historic buildings so roofs begin to leak a word rocks you know water gets a works ever gone before so almost chains around and whatnot for I guess yeah\nI'm actually at a lightning strike not too long ago so ... those types of things I mean there's constant upkeep that needs to go into the store cows and\nThen you have to pay the electric bills in the water bills and all kinds of the bills that we get our own houses over time um and then you know we have staff there during the research stuff that are managing the tours and volunteers and you're making sure that they're taken care of so there's lots of different factors that go into the actual cost has to manage the sights\nIf someone had a you know we always hear about wanting to donate property in cars and you can't look to the radio hearing somebody's willing to you know wanted for tax write off or whatever I\nArgue actively looking for what are you know what if for some reason or the ... who says you know my great aunt and my family forever\nI don't leave it to I don't want to and having to deal with it\nI Do I mean it was something to you guys would require or at least eighty guide how we get someplace where it's safe\nYeah pretty often hear people contact us and say a relative right I Want to thank you very much for your ever to a very bad at any of learning about a charter schools how they are real hero greatly how did you do you live in one of our children are so very proud of ex\nMother in Iran regarding other jobs and it's a ... year ends of the collection so that we have so you know we just\nDon't take everything you know we are very targeted in terms of what we want to take the kind of wrote to caution that speaks the history of Congress one county or other museums around her as well and so it was maybe not necessarily for some of our collection we can help guide you through the right spot for\nHow many of the other day with an object ended up having them off to the University of Georgia are confident enough to go there and certainly off\nAnd it gets agitate and even photograph and it is that I'm ... and then there's one one to the border hours that\nI'm Out of our tiny she just found a box under that it just old boss rotted in and they were um Semitism used in John ... photos old photograph can really help tell the story of our past I'm particularly\nUm wouldn't buildings were torn down et cetera as we could look at pictures and see what sort of ...\nEt cetera so I'm all for it I don't think that we're actively looking for that is and I'm a primary lease or primary um primary like it I think the artifacts documents ... dot ... early early\n[laughter] All right James ... and ... ... dot org\nOr you can always ...

five eight hundred a Saturday morning as a five to an eastern time\nAnd you can also send questions in and watch the show law but cc auto show dot com you around we were talking with Fred\nYes we were um in or remind you need throughout the tech tip after Fred how 'bout that we wouldn't do that we will toss it right out there um okay so Fred you mentioned that you had a code having to do with the frontal deployment loop on the driver's side uh on on\nThe hero to six\nRight and there's typically how technician would do that as install a simulator in a simulator does just that simulates the airbag system um and the reason you use as 'cause when you're testing it especially the wiring in the integrity that wiring you read it really need to disable the a airbag system\nSo what I'm going to be doing is is checking your simulator so simulator normally has about two homes in it and you would plug that into the airbag connector at the steering wheel and then you would go to the uh after the clock spring which will be further on down the column and see if you have to um to resistance at the bottom the connector\nAnd of course if you did that stealing you the clock springs correct the only other thing I Would add to that as you do need to turn the steering wheel to make sure it's constantly asked to own um you know obviously because it could be making contact say going straight but not turning right\nUm so that's that's one thing that would be done um that is a common o'clock spring issue uh there's there's very rare or rarely an issue with the airbags themselves just because they're made so well and they have dual loops in them and all that kind of stuff\nUm so I Do feel like it could be a clock spring the only other thing that I could say is just tried to blow the horn see if it still works a lot of times and clock springs go out um you know if the cable actually snaps in there that of course you know nobody that's just a quick tests or does it mean that it's cut and dried but just something to try\nAnd framed one quick answer to part of your question was is that something you could possibly do yourself I feel like I'm Sorry go ahead\nPlease could you um [noise] and I got a ... that are trying to jump back so\nThat he is saying I was going to do is just being ... following the procedure on disabling the airbag goes you hadn't you it makes a bad day when you're doing something like that and then all of a sudden you're something go boom and all other airbags go off but you do end up finding the problem you need a ... do you need everything ...\nOkay okay I got to be worked at it before but there is it ... the so pickup truck and there's two things wrong with it says I have been closed circuit and number eight shown and a look at that I Can't even\nI Can't even figure out exactly where it is like you know what I mean do vehicle is I\nKinda\nOh Paul you and everything looks like cover it up or do you want to believe is very easy to get to the inner ... come out they're all just push clips and they would they would if it was a snake bite you they're right there in front of you very simple to change\nI'm very accessible you know a lot of the other vehicles during the valve covers and stuff like that these are a threat to the cylinder head\nA little eight millimeter now holds the wire on ten millimeter pulls the glow plug out\nOnly thing I Would add to that is as\nYou know a lot of people say don't ever pull spark plugs don't ever pull any boats\nOut when aluminum pot I actually think the other way I like to get it hot or saturated with the blaster WD forty and then let it cool down with that you know of course penetrating all in there and then break it free\nOkay not just another call here says I'm a ... a pressure for the article shelter under the vehicle right\nRight next to catch the only got ... to me I\nWas the ... circuit code or was it a performance\nOkay on the color was let me see the full she'll four or five four\nTo four or five I think that performance if I'm not mistaken I can look that up for you but if it's a performance issue that can actually tell you that they're particularly it is it could be restricted\nCourse there's an inland temperature and an outlet temperature and that's kind of how it determines uh of course obviously the efficiency of it um and if the pressure sensors reading high voltage of course it it could be a bad censored that typically more of a performance code again um if it's a circuit code derided could read open it could be shorted\nI'm the only other way I Know to fix that has to accidentally remove it\n[laughter] okay no I'm kidding I was talking about the whole mix it up and\nTake it out with it which which reading or should\nIt should yes if you have a scandal that has of course live data on it um you could you know of course remove it and just make sure that the data changes that would be obviously with it running that way you could see what you know whether it has a restriction or not but yes that would definitely tell you that\n[laughter] okay well kept extensive you want to catch\nA I mean everything's expensive on a diesel but it's not an astronomical part no it's not\nOkay well thank you very much about them as I should be able to do that too easy\nTo yeah you can tackle that no problem\nWith the southern coast for a while I was kind of caused a lot of problems or could\nIt actually could because the the admission system is taking pretty seriously uh after it sees that code for several a drought cycles that can actually limit the power and it'll give you a message about that because again it is\nThere's always the possibility of it becoming completely restricted which obviously can do damage to the engine so you know the sooner the better on any admissions code on a piece of\n... okay well thanks a lot of\nScientists on that and they go and get your address ... we don't send you a bill for this one okay for and I thank you for\nHow much it up quite a bit\nAll right we appreciate the call hey John Ron I Know he said\nTo him to quit but let's go straight to Bobby Bobby spent hold and what if we want to stay in
