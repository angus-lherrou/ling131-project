and\nDo we have a tailgate talk from Dominic\nThat's not the right one of them know that must mean that we do yes we we do have a tailgate talk here and this one is the one that you may be interested in how can you imagine a world without traffic lights fried\nWow now that would be very tricky to uh have a a a lot of people don't pay attention to them anyway so I mean it wouldn't be that bad\nWhat if what if we could ignore the traffic lights and not get into accidents wow\nThat would be huge so Ford is working on a system right now they're actually testing it over in the United kingdom where the cars are going to be communicating with each other to where the basically the the [noise] excuse me [noise]\nBut they're down [laughter]\nThere is the system 'cause it's called ... that intersection priority management ha ha so the cars are communicating with each other and what they'll do is the car that's approaching intersection\nWe'll talk to the cars that are coming from cross traffic uh-huh and they can determine what the best speed that they need to reach in order to pass through the intersection without stopping oh\nSo it I think that ants if you've ever watched a lot of aunts and and and he'll be evidently had that\nAlready because you'll see an sit will ... there'll be moving and then it won't be one of them stop it it'd be just one go a little slower and then boom they'll go right through there\nAnd and of course all that technology is vi to the vehicle to vehicle to wear a different car will be talking to each other as we go so that's going to be citing time that you don't really even stop for the light you just slow down enough\nFor the other one the whiz by in other words what Aaron does already yeah yeah that's that's very close very few people rod wouldn't may now because the because of that\nDecade thank you for a tailgate talk yep\nOkay that is our tailgate talk and if you have a question about your car truckers UV you give us a call and that number seven six six three five eight hundred and that Saturday mornings I Do five to ten and along with I'm answering questions or asking questions You're welcome to call in if you've got\nOut that you used for driving disown your smartphone and you want to mention one that has worked well for you even if it's one we've already mentioned you might mention a new way of using it so give us a call and mentioned it out now one that comes to mind I mean pretty much if you think about cars\nAnd think about apps and you think about driving one that comes to mind just automatically is gas buddy oh yeah yeah if you if you're looking for the best price of fuel and if you're in and even if you're in another city and you say oh I Need a gas station really bad\nGas buddy can come in really well because you're not only see the gas stations but you'll see their prices that they have and you'll be able to pick out and you can put them in order from the brand that they are if you want to do it that way and you can uh and just I'm\nIn and actually they have about Seventy million users that do that and they let you know where to get where you can get the best gas and and again you can filter it all sources that you could even tell\nWhich ones have a car wash 'em and there's also a lot of people don't know this but they got things in gas buddy that can help you improve your gas mileage\nYeah and that would be yet I'm now there is one other one that a lot of people use it I'm asked our producer\nUm we have a producer and hear Joe that mentions that he has an app that he uses on his phone from time to time\nAnd I wanted to hear how he uses it because I I hear of it often but really I hadn't actually been using that particular out that that he uses on a real regular basis the way he mentioned\nA Joe what is that ... that you use on the phone and how has it worked well for you\nOr the app is cold ways mhm and say GPS app but it's also a social network so essentially you have\nHundreds of drivers on the roads especially in the bigger cities like Atlanta and their passengers do not operate you're found row you are driving\nOur reporting road conditions there reporting spotted police vehicles\nPotentially hazardous situations and as you're driving along not only do you get navigation directions but you also get a glimpse at what's going on on a deeper level All right\nWell we use something like that even twenty twenty five thirty years ago it was called a C B so yeah that a modern city we joke that is that is really good and you say you do use that on a regular ...\n\nOkay we appreciate you sharing that with us so ways is a great that are in in so many people already use it and and probably would've been a good idea about what am I Do use gas buddy from time to time and especially if I'm travelling and and want to see some things um see some different things\nAnd in and of course both of these can save your money let's say that if you were\nTraveling through a city and you knew there was going to be a traffic jam that was going to tie you up for a long period of time you know and you knew about it early you could go ahead and and divert go to a different direction\nAnd of course you're not sitting in traffic for thirty or forty minutes wasting gas and said you're moving and and doing what you need to do so both of those are really good items to go to", "show_name": "C&C Auto Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "21"}
