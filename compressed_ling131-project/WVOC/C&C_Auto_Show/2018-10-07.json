[laughter]\nBut one thing I'm really excited about we just ... in the garden so um we've talked a lot about our house museums but not so much our gardens and grounds so all of this\nProperty sit on fourteen acres consolidated of space downtown and in Colombia\nUm and one of those is the rubber ... gardens which is just beautiful and so we have scare president gardens which has\nA more than twenty um scare cries and that's a free exhibit that's open to stake your Sunday um on the grounds of the rubber mills site and we've invited local artists families churches businesses just different organizations to come out and make some really creative scare cries\nThey've got a Harry Potter scare credit out there some really cool artistic ones that were done by local artists I'm so encouraged people to come out bring the family um and just enjoy the gardens and hopefully we'll have some nice fall weather\nSo far so good or something [laughter] [noise] what other what other stuff you looking forward to as we were quickly closing on two thousand or Eighteen into Nineteen you know how you move forward in history what's your immuno besides events and things but how are you ... what are you looking to do you know in the in the future plan for history\nWe know anytime that our research is kind of come across new information I mean history is always changing and the sense that we find information that we didn't learn before so\nWe always have kind of projects that are in the works coming up we I'm often revise the tours that we go again if you've taken one of our walking tours before come back and take it again because we've often corporate a new information into it and the same with historic houses has museums and we managed there's always new information that's going in there and so\nI'm One project is coming up as a just cause some contests of civil rights leader here in Colombia\nUm we're going to be taking a look at that site and talking about having him again But Jessica Simpkins because I Know you were hearing\nFolks I Know you know she doesn't live here and so really needed us a mental issues Michael Schmidt say what's his name Nicholas ... [laughter] I was trying to go for just just The Simpsons ... my ... go on\nWell anyway we're going to be taken a look at that site and doing some new exhibits and and working there and so people will definitely be able to see that we're actually just had her jubilee festival last month and so I'm at the next to believe that we are going to be outside the public's that's going to be an exciting time for us\nSo there's a lot more and who who funds historic Colombia and obviously do sunrise played him society memberships and its member do you get any national funds in a local ... what are you guys get all the money to do\nThe um we're a nonprofit organization say we rely heavily on the ... community support so private donations from individuals businesses corporation\nBut I'm a member base our earned revenues through tours and events um but also we heavily rely on grants that we get from private foundations but also on a James mention them ... ...\nUm site that is through a national grant national park services um we also um rely heavily on local government support so city of Columbia\nAnd Richland county um provide at a good portion of our budget on which goes I'm primarily to manage the sites that are Richland and city at Richland county and city of Columbia and\nI'm ... I'm not I don't care about exactly what is what's rough number that it costs to maintain like either one or maybe it maybe all five properties just to just kind of wrap our heads around what kind of funds you actually need to operate a a a a an agency\nYeah I mean if you think about all the different costs are going to managing a site like that for example we have to pay for the upkeep of the science themselves so for example you know I mean these are old historic building so roofs began to leak a word rocks you know water gets and where it's ever gotten before so all of the big chains around and whatnot you know I guess yeah yeah so I'm\nActually at a lightning strike not too long ago so ... those types of things I mean there's constant upkeep that needs to go into the store cows than you have to pay the electric bills and the water bills and all kinds of the bills that we get our own houses over time\nUm and then you know we have staff there during the research we have stuff that are managing the tourism volunteers and you know making sure that they're taking care of so there's lots of different factors that go into but the actual causes to manage those sites\nIf someone had a you know we always hear about wanting to donate property in cars and you can't listen to radio hearing somebody is willing to you know want it to for tax write off or whatever are you actively looking for what do you know what if for some reason or the ... who says you know what my great aunt it's been in my family forever I or anybody to leave it to\nI don't want him to happen to but I Want to do with it I Do I mean it was something that you guys would will require or at least maybe guide how we can get someplace where it's safe\nYeah pretty often you know people contact us and say uh\nRowley right I Want to thank you very much for your average I very much of anything stuff learning about for a charter schools how they are you'll hear about money and greatly housing Italy and you can use ... but at the same kind of artist shoulder and what they do very like objects were mother and her man for coming on average about ... minutes to take a look at it on his hair cells into\nThe collection scope that we have so you know we just don't take everything you know we are very targeted in terms of what we want to take to kind of grow the collection that speaks the history of ... county there are other museums around here as well and so if it's maybe not something that necessarily fits into our collection we can help guide you to the right spot for\nFactory at somebody just the other day with some objects and we ended up sending them off to the University of Georgia archives killed off it made sense to go there and not necessarily us we'll\nJust go ahead and glad to say and even photographs and video that um there's one one supporter of ours that\nUm I remember telling me she just found a box under a bad just old photographs brought it in and they were um some of those were used and John cheers remembering Columbia book says photos old photographs can really help tell the story of our past I'm particularly\nUm when buildings were torn down et cetera so we could look at pictures in the wet storefront used to look like when people used to wear et cetera so um that's I'll say something that we're actively looking for or photographs and videos and right on

could steal a primer on it and then if they ... a clerk\nAnd doing steps properly um it should eliminate the problem and they should ever having a problem with it again\nSo you do feel like it's more of a pain primary issue rather than he'd like who is you know this is kind of a tall yeah we've heard more pain issue and then a lot of people say is due to the engine heat but like I mentioned the air and I mean uh the root for the van got this you know it was getting the same temperature especially indirect sun so I've never really seen a roommate deal\n... ... it's it's not a key issue as far as the external heat orange and he writes it is it is a primary issue\nUm you know the paint companies and everything and it it's a long story is how it was on the air go to it but it's it's the things that you know go back to uh paint manufacturers color ... up\nThe bottle a volatile organic compounds that manufacture cars only allowed somebody sees her car manufacturing\nAnd I tried to cut
