glass\nAnd when you have those um shower pans and over time when it begins to wear out the only thing protecting those strands\nOf fiberglass is what they call a clear coat or a gel coat\nAnd\nWants that has worn off you can't keep it clean because the soaps gum and the dirt and everything gets in between those fibers so you can get you can apply a new gel coat\nYou can\nUh get a company like a

positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a turn two of the biggest causes of deaths worldwide now imagine for a moment that you can get a warning that you are going to have a heart attack\nYears before the event ever occurred that's right well thanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries says it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans\nTell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develops they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should start preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this

commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready good there's a dark side of technology that a lot of folks are brushing off\nIt's the use of robots for use in\nHow do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... brought the one issue soon so that people would be able to use its human like dogs\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie Westworld K Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visited location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles\nA human being [noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name for that\nHow about a Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise an average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies and the year two\nThousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers the studies show that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on legislation politicians\nAre getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right you're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nOr a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the rail tracks\nBritish woman Louis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a\nBeach walls so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see\nThat's it but if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a refund had shot for the funeral mhm\nAnd finally be careful what you search for online we were talking about this before

Washington\nAnd her neck actually are you I'm good what's going on [noise] um\nI've been looking into some money making it up um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are or you may be inviting trouble phone ... possibly viruses are our\n... you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA\nLiving you know on a book extra months\nLiving here it's a it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars or you know two thousand dollars or anything like that you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is one that led to watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I pull this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion ab that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in Moscow a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right\nUm 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task for you and so I've heard you know what might as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right\nAnd so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Cosco\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the app and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com\nGift card or a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk\n... that you can take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way there's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise]\nUh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit\nThere's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right I you know you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff and but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat coined\nOkay for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translated into like an apple gift card\nTheir surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm ... these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my

actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer it [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio\nMade to his debit ATM card [noise]\nShe then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I any replacement card immediately about travel out of state of California\nWell the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon\nOr California or those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California orange so not a problem any charges that you make an Oregon or California will be fine\n\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor she said you know it just to make sure that everything is on the up and up I just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address

your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now and he said oh okay\nWell you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what the scammer head was every single thing about him except for the Penn\n[noise] and so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had been number she had everything in front of her but she didn't have the PIN number\nSo by going through every step she
