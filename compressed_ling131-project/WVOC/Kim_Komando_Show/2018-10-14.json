P. N. app but when I'm using ...\nAnd I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I had\nGood his fat different is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basic okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account your password your Amazon dot com pass whatever may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that out of the year so and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out okay\nAnd so the whole idea behind using the VP an app\nIs that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun I Can't wait I'm so excited\nFor you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love this to mind\nWhen you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick her daily square or whatever it may be is that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool\nAnd then the other thing I Do are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to Sweden which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right question song and you know if you could do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so ah so you're right there are all these different VPN lose some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your whatever\nUh then there's nowhere to BP and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that uses\nWe do in thank you Ken for having me um we ... the net dot com just want to really quickly as you

here's the I'll go to ... net dot com slash contest pod net dot com slash contests and give us some great reviews and let me tell you the back story and why we're doing this\nIs that when you give us a review in the algorithms that Google playing in the algorithm at apple pie cats that suddenly that's how more people get\nTold about new shows and so you know you can't buy advertising in you can't do anything else so it's all done by review so if you have learned one thing from me over the years just one thing\nLeads me one review go to pod net dot com says contest Sondra thanks for coming on

were really upset but they're showing\nA single parent community with triple digit membership at ... community good are over forty thousand\nWell the reason why I the reason why I say that is Google said that they shut it down not only because they had were going to talk about this and the next hour but they had it open for three years but basically the heads of goals that nobody is using it anyway so it was shut it down so you do have different options there is one side\nOr that you didn't mention is bad it's called the ds for off\nAnd that's D. A. S. P. or a with a dance for it looks and it works\nIt acts a lot like Google Plus where a it's a little bit different meaning that you choose a pod as the kind of that's what they call their ... their groups pod so you can create a pod if that's what you what you sign up and then you join the conversation\nUh and then they're also integrate into your other social media so if you did want to tell everybody on Facebook or Twitter or ... what have you that you had this group going that would be one way there's also another site called steam it and that's S.

West\nYes but it's more of the tax side\nOf the con us we're we're not getting into politics\nNot at all at all love I'm Adam whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learn ... uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states a guess okay when you unlock that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what his past ... let me give you a hint very similar\nTo yours well you know I have I saw them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when you change it this morning or do you draw the line [laughter] and so now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven Seventy seven seven seven seven that's far from the zero zero right\nMuch harder the other thing that the Internet was criticizing Kanye West for tech wise was that he had his phone in a case yeah I Want the big deal about that it's not cool it's no longer cool down your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being as those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I\nDon't want it to shatter if I drop and\nThe criticism is is that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back unless you have a mold for you that's going to charge it there's no reason to have a case well that's what the Internet was a decade or there's stupid okay\nHere's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty get mine pink my black okay but the reason why it's paying is so that when I throw it into my black per se I can find\nSo that's why if you got one like me

password one two three because odds are that's what his passport is so thin came out the stories about horrible past rush to have and I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking\nYou never heard a password walking never that's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and\nYour password most popular walked password is one shoe\nTo W. E. three four are getting back to the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across race\nThing and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight down to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is worse to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you weren't just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords jobs do don't I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's the way to to step verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password\n'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an Yahoo wrap on my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get it\nYeah and that's really the the off yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who

there Thomas\nHello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource function something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using a nap or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nVisit their an easier way to do that by having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little look at the end of the summer that said\nHere's what I Do to grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in text it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nI see if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yet so we used to fly you shutter flies at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note through the website\nKnow that sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website and I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your questions things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content or for a tip\nCool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and pure Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join can clip right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the ... commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on line intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have the freedom to be anonymous and on traceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend ... freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nActually cure even less you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust Estee cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount ... camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nScary David went in and I just started up\nHigh winds rain hell we get it All right here in the ... your your roof is damage during a storm or the roof of someone you know or love is eight five five go by your number to call the local pros at may your roofing and you'll have a peace of mind to do I do work hand in hand with your insurance company to make sure there are no problems with that claim everything is done by the book\nWhether it's a hurricane or just a good old fashioned storm eight five five go with a local pros at million roofing find out more online to ... million moving dot com or\nCalled today and let's get storey\nFive sixty WVU sea\nHorses and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and resources visit and\nBe prepared dot com slash Kim and be ready for anything once again that's be prepared dot com slash Kim [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cams that are just wide open to attack\nAnd I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called chai among guy that's all that\nThe company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to be the name on the Web cam or their security can because they make tons of Web cams for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening\nIs that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change\nIn the fall password somebody can still break in\nAnd if in case you want to see if your webcam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course it's K.

fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right here I'm In Boston it's okay to ... all along reputation management mhm let's be like well with me the best all around that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it that was all or am a software that you ... and then the field that search engine optimization have to go with oil all L\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nWhile the mob and let them or if it's obviously what most of us have is\nYou know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden were able to balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put posted a\nPositive experience as they have what you at your business [noise] so what am I here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do is buy something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation\nType management farm okay [noise] is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because you are may be able to do it more effectively\nAnd do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too is that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job that's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\n[noise] right and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or\nWere where is it so I'm Glad for all the medical school it's like ... grade the car okay all ladies they use excel\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to this is what you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you up on line and\nJust dropped some wrapping up there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews\nOkay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can okay let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades as drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this then health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee that they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be\nOn the top anymore so so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and\nI haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay in to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "city": "Columbia", "day":
