and the title was\nYou want twenty percent for handing me a muffin the awkward advocate of I had a thing and I don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody's using square\nAnd they're on their I pet or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it ... I I don't want to name a possible out if possible sponsor a future sponsors so I'll just say there's a place it is called but narrow Brett [laughter]\nI was talking and code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed the seven foot wall with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you well if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat so if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my ... pay a farmer's market\nI bought spinach pasta\nWas twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole and\nYou know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right and so this is pretty much her business well it is for business and what I Love about in the call is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional sheets on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business that came in at something\nShe uses square okay and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown\nThat whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call which is really the goal of all businesses that people have more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so\nYou know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and they and their mind they need a new you know they're getting ready for college showing their cheekbones looking really hungry or whatever it may be\nI said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I said so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are gone like thirty percent\nBut the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great so when you're up\nA narrow do you tip yeah really\nI Do that they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay but here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and\nWhen you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work is somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out\nAre not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but a bad but as ... okay but\nSometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something and ... had to tip jars\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nNow let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband ... just because we have to honor that\nAnd they are they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping with us forty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you got this way everybody has the picture\nAnd um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been serving\nWell it was great things I mean every day's an adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have a er rent and you don't know we have a full size of refrigerator\nAirbus and if you decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nI have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo we're seeing a systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we're going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard a was that we have to take off the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] fortunately that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your\nMother board in the refrigerator while it's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] nice All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question and I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see if we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA stick obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer sight\nOf that we can get out for\nOur kids to be able to jump on there and drag that twenty two gig video a back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital uh we decided to call the gym commando show so here you don't\nAnd so so when the sun is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig has huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nAnd then you can delete it\nYou want to you or your protective yeah you're protecting put it in on a you know with a um a private URL oh okay\nSo that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all\nI mean All right\nThen they do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up while he totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish you do it's a very much for pleasure glad to talk to you today yeah really you\nKnow break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of Hal in Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or\nThey have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends stay right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life parents teachers dentists and only is it different technique\nUp and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't have most of the issues worn out toothbrushes to boot\nSo let me introduce you to clip clip is electric it small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with Clinton\nKnew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars try clip and see why it's backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quip stars that just twenty five dollars bats it does it get clipped\nCame right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
