okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't\nSure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\n... and I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati\nOn friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president\nI think he's in Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz what ... done but crews doesn't add the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and\nIf you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and will back the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that confident fake and just do

violent protest cities would burn on the Democratic mayor so it would be there would be a hundreds killed millions of dollars or property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans looked at that and said we don't want Humphrey in sixty eight or take next a new promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration buildings taken over in college campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look at it didn't like what they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and are working on behalf of the moral majority in the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight in Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you are at age ... says the rules of civility or suspended because Republicans control the Congress and once the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is a blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points independent voters believe the Democrats actor like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number\nSee Hillary's doing this now she's Seventy Seventy one years old and she wants to appear hip and radical\nBut at say ... it's not true it doesn't work she used to say during the campaign I'm with you\nKnow Hillary as saying I'm with them being ... demonstrators that black lives matter protesters who demand the murder of cops what are we went dead cops one we want them now that black lives matter protesters that say pigs in a blanket from like bacon\nFat is what is encouragement of the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration has black radicals and wide

have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago were top should not have shot that boys sixteen times\nEvery now and then you have something bad happened the want to point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops do water right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument for the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand with Kevin ... and\nI don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the results of most of the most of the elections by a by midnight tonight we're going to know twenty eight days from now and I'm willing to strongly predict that the United States Senate

of downtown Portland and what do you tell us factually what's going on in Portland, Oregon\nAnd it's nothing short of anarchy [noise] um we can go back to the uh are taking the access fed even let that go on for months then disbanded that finally got the best of the police chief [noise] um [noise]\nSome of them moved to city hall and you may recall a story where a a ... fee hall stabbed his

watching individuals to beat up on cars stopping city streets and explain what's going on\nThat [noise] [noise] the mayor told the police to stand out I don't think that she was going to stand for that very much longer um\nIt's it's an arcane ... they uh they let these protests they call them peaceful protests mind you they let these contracts in this case it is over a\nCivilian that was shot by police officer\nResponding to another shooting so they are taking the intersection for going on two weeks now at a believe it's forcing pedophile pedophile being Harvey Milk they've decided to rename the street and um they've been there for two weeks now and it's time to let the city have street back it's ridiculous\nHow is it possible that a few dozen antifa protesters can take over an intersection in the downtown area of the city for you're telling me weeks and the police do nothing about it\nBasically for the most part they let them go bell dogs all they're talking about and then they decide to grow up at the end of a workday I don't know what the uh what what what the motivation is they just pick and choose what they want to do something\nIsn't covered in the news or people angry about what's going on\nIn a cover the the uh the left slant of it up here unfortunately we don't really have a non biased news network\nSo you don't have television condemning this kind of misbehavior they cover it is if they have a valid point\nOut of our local conservative talk show radio host up here in in Portland no we don't have a voice saying otherwise\nWell it does is Portland to conceal carry steak can you have your own weapon yes isn't it so much risk either be pulling people out of cars and stopping them and beating their vehicles with sticks and baseball bats isn't that a bit dangerous\nAll you may recall a story about two years ago were a one Mr Strickland has a firearm out for four and a half seconds to push back a group of people though are approaching them an intimidating him he is\nUnder very set of charges right now trying to fight all that back because of the city has come down on him rather than the people that were intimidating him\nTo the guy defending himself as the one arrested yes this is crazy what are you this is crazy Ted Wheeler the mayor gets her he is he making the political calculation that this behavior is popular in Portland\nAnd it's we're we're on the west coast I call myself a Wolverine I Am a a citizen behind enemy lines and the people's Democratic Republic of Oregon Havana on the planet ... prefecture\nSo

don't say this without feeling deeply embarrassed at least\nBut the left does not feel embarrassed\nThey are licking their wounds this week I think that conservatives under the circumstances have been\nA quite generous in how we have responded now that we finally achieved justice and yes it is justice or judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court oh we recognize that there are other things to turn our focus do we recognize that there are other ways\nTo spend our time and attention I was very pleased that last night President Trump did take a moment\nTo apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the White House at a ceremony play a clip one\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire cabinet or family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose step forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nThe presumption of innocence a has\nBeen something that is under assault here from\nThe very beginning I mean the presumption of innocence was going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process and sure enough it was saved at the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle\nIt could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem in fact they would have been gleeful had it gone the other way\nWouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process despite all of that\nKavanaugh is bending over backwards doing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be a fair and dare I say judicious judge that he will do everything that he can\nTo continue his legacy of decades of public service\nYou know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made partner he'd be making easily a few million dollars a year right now easily studies or been in a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes\nOut of every now and less than two hundred grand or something like that\nWhich you could say well but he's still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he couldn't be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary and understands it that's a very important role in very important service and\nDo they don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praising understood to be top of this field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was some the gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick Kevin ... was the guy who was doing what he could\nIn order to at least be impartial as a judge should be whenever you here's case\nAnd they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys family destroys reputation that there is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives\nTake their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nInstill the limbs finally recognize that what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done\nThat they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity\nWe must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know to be good and right for the country no matter how much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act like a bunch of savages we have to push forward\nAnd we have to stay United and we have to win\nTrump understands that that said\nKavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and he loved the country and so in so much as possible foreign

Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court he was with the majority opinion of\nAlmost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interpret the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much\nBut there is an underlying truth here and that is that the country is a better place with more respect for the rules were there will be more respect for the rule of law where every American\nHave his rights more respected under the constitution because ... a judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice capital liberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court

now in some of these departments in women's studies women and gender studies we called the bags\nAt Amherst College where I went\nI took a wax class that was interesting ah it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to guess how critical\nOf of the Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors ruin to be the answer is not really at all summer how\nWomen are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought you know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense of being a radical conservative just means that\nYou know you like celebrating the fourth of July and have read the constitution it and it ... and it matters to you I'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who ... who believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you went in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservative according to the left\nThe college was certainly a process radicalization for me and that way but the grieving studies departments are churning out millions of young

it's\nAs any if you listen to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I've been about any anything um in defense of Kavanaugh and then in absolute opposition to this obvious mirror effort by

it is a scary\nTime for men\nAnd in response a singer songwriter named Lindsey labs Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song of that statement I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessments but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of it goes ...\nMade a name in Nineteen Ninety nine King Live and\nI Can't you might end in Ninety and

people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this was a parody song she's making political points where I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to the president said about how it's a scary time to be a man she says things like\nIt is or rather ... you can't\nHave the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe\nNeighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme I'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then just say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women and my dad and let them go to the bar without a chaperone and I know plenty of women who\nWear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to wherever they screw it whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like\nSaying so why\nAre we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton's\nNow that's not to say that bad things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation about oh you're saying there's no and this is what the left those are you saying that sexual assault is it a problem of course of ...\nIt's a it's a heinous crime a phony for which people are severely punished as they should be but there is a hysteria and this is what I'm really trying to\nGet out with the lyrics in this song and the way that\nThe media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape culture is a myth there is no rape culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nUh so what where is this coming from and\nI mean the truth is that the same identity politics very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nIt also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women in American\nSociety and it's just not in keeping with reality and that is\nVery troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side\nWhen you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk around dressing how I mean I'm here in D.C I've lived in New York ... this is this is not the Taliban\nVersion of America would walk around dressing however they want as they will should\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places

that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures admit that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that as a slender\nJust not true why did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives\nAnd they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys\nOr so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other

talk to you or my lifeline from the swamp everyday team I I I Do not bond with this place I I cannot I've lived here before for years I've never bonded with this place\nSo ah the reality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now\nIs that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has a mind you know people don't think of her as a minority female she is a minority female\nOr you know she has minority female or in her background or rather she is by background of minority female\nUm she's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types right I mean there's there's ... there's\nNikki Haley um there's trying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration that's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there's some people but certainly\nAre well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em\nBut the Trump Administration is non traditional and that is included a lotta nontraditional appointments but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a\nAnd so when she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my gosh what does this mean and as I said I don't think it means very much at all\nI think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks\nOh that was gonna say pumped but I I I don't think pumped pale would have been secretary of state and another minister ration but he's a former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I didn't compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party congressman I Know but still um\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find that interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump season is increasingly I've always thought it's a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor if it read it it's a title that guys being trumpeted\nThat means is kicking button taking names so\nWhilst they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh ...\nBecause there's thought in the GOP that Nikki Haley is is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee\nNow let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh\nDoes anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like\nIn six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six\nAnswers now you got no idea or am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain um but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do which is come up with a narrative\nThat will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation ... filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah\nNever have to worry about content you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this bizarre oh I think so and so it was going to run on things don't look part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun and it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nOn the honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she is necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling a Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always got to remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish in a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieve high office in government\nIs that they're sellouts that their traders trader to their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh\nAnd then she was a a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um but I think that uh\nYou know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelve\n[noise] I'm not making the end of the airlines go is that we make sure that everything is going to fight for the African fair to come and in fact in ... and the United states and I'm proud to be part of the team now I don't have anything that way I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we don't want to hurricane down there by the shooting for hitting on line and then to come in\nAnd Iran and North Korea it's been eight years and then ...\n... I Believe or any harm on I think you have to be flexible enough to know when you have someone else to do the job [noise]\nYeah there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the administration that's why she's leaving folks I I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or stories and that and if there is all certainly that you know but for now\nIt is what it is Nikki Haley's\nHadn't out doesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's\nMy analysis of it I Know but what are you doing [noise] uh but I Do want to spend a little time with you on the midterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and\nCreating permanent stability and then I Would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zones\nAnd overall things are really good right now or the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset\nThat is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the left going into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment to use radio five\n\nOut as one never missed a customer again when customers called ... or email expressed

Clinton one of the leaders of the lives is out there telling people\nThat for civility to Richard in our politics today for that to happen\nDemocrats has to win this is the problem we have right now with the political exchange between the two sides\nThey are delusional\nThis reminds me of an of an editorial that I had been meaning to bring up to you or earlier in the week I was so excited to talk to you on Monday could have been a few days that I skipped right past us but the editor in chief of Politico\nWho I I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political is which is a political side left wing people or it doesn't bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a but he wrote a piece about how maybe more or less it's time to to take the gloves off\nA about how ... maybe now is the time for Democrats\nTo stop playing nice stop playing nice they were accusing cabin on being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely insane they're completely nuts how\nDo you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi because you're pro Second Amendment I said\nThere's nothing you can do don't engage because you're talking you might as well be talking to a person who's pushing around a shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's\nThat's what we're up against now and this is unfortunately the end result of a massive media echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking some form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on here\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach\nThere are problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side to just go completely scorched earth insane and then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and is there crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or somebody in front of the other network you\nWere saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurants that's not a mom I I'm Sorry that's them up if we can to agree and this was a CNN and I'm\nNot we're not going to play that clip today I'm gonna let it just uh 'cause 'cause I\nI like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it\nAt some level if we can't agree that the people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are\nPublic officials who are laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for a ... if if they're going to laugh about that\nIf they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens ... meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces everything else\nIf they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice but to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know what else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it that is the ... that is the only option there is no other option you know people who think that\nThese these are just the basic laws of human nature and power the left does not believe in these things and they'll say oh but look at what about the equality in in Sweden first of all they think that equality just means having a large welfare state\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries that the less points to a there's not a huge emphasis on this state enforcing the same outcomes for all people right there was some people do better than others\nMaybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes of people there's only so much the state is able to do a unless you empower it to a point where it's\nSo powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you you have whatever the state Danes to leave you um but I suppose I'm getting\nToo deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser Tucson loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and Trump will say and other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listening to the show ...\nMany of you saw that and very very early on I've not just come around to it now I consider myself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way\nOf doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you know you you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies would certainly in the case of a rub your weight and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nUh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time\nThat CNN sits on the Senate Christiana one pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I Know her name I just don't like to say that because it's ... it's ... ah not Christine it's ... and she told the front of my sons are but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out\nHe doesn't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense but on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this meat to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nOn them for us Hillary about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S to see if they'd be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer those questions you have a pet to us for them and how do you have that\nSimilar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference outside and that is\nThe intense [noise]\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] is that\nYou know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison nation welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician oh\nThere's a big difference alright between\nWhat happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or in the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who\nYou'd know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or did you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never hear answers for Ford\nBill Clinton was accused of rape by Juanita broader Roderick but he was accused of sexual assault by Jennifer Flowers I mean these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know you say that those women should be believed she went on often against those women\nThe difference is not the investigation between cabin all and Clinton the difference is that one of them actually is a predator and the author or the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary\nIs show dishonest and so disgraceful that she thinks she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other you know there wasn't\nOne of them was being investigated forty did while president while governor of Arkansas the other was being being accused of stuff and when he was Seventeen year old kid thirty six years ago\nBut he still thinks she can hit hit back at Trump for quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally\nIt further undermined the image and integrity of the court [noise] um and that\nTroubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main colors of\nConstitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divides it will pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women on throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned in insulted women folks Hillary Clinton when it suited her and you know what else was true and also said here on this show no ... going to be in trouble as long as the feminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminist left cannot credibly\nThere's that word claim to really be about empowering women [noise]\nEvery day I have the incredible honor and privilege upbringing you my thoughts you're on this program but I Want

because you're designing these things to get us addicted it doesn't mean that we actually have to to use them that way\nYou know what you're saying all this stuff it it just makes me think\nOf some of the uncomfortable recognitions about myself but I've had it's in the last year maybe year and a half where I realized things like\nI get a little ill and I don't know if the only ones I talked to some friends about it I mean I talked about on the show\nI feel anxious if I don't have ... if I don't have my smartphone within reach\nI feel like I'm going to miss a call I'm going to miss an email

you're like wait a minute what am I missing and might not plugged in I remember losing my phone and a taxi cab and I tell a lot of really\nEmbarrassing crazy personal stories in this book and one of them is that I lost it and a cat it was like I had lost the child or a dog or something that was alive I was completely untethered that was a sign that I had and I coined that phrase oh the the the obsessive compulsive disorder people laugh\nBut it's really really true and and and the thing is to you you and I around the same age but I think I'm a little older than you I don't know why it has brought that up maybe the audience can forget I just said that but\nThere are ... times you know it looks twenty five so for all intents and purposes she is twenty five go ahead my friend\nBut we come from a time where we grew up and we didn't have all this intrusion we didn't have all the social media we weren't setting staring at the cell phones\nWhat drove me crazy is thinking about kids getting
