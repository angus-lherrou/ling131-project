vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state is that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stop we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they shut up his problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe don't understand is very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president's pick the following actions no they want to point fingers and screamed raised ... and they want photos of

count\nAnd it's just very very destructive\nIt's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it is just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and a welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows says no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes the legal and God Bless and welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year working in a million through our legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand all my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster well hold on a second\nWe're already taking a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing the number only go in one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even an office for\nIf we're lucky the next six years to try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\n\nDemocrats don't want to do because Wal first off would prove its

that's pretty easy if you're going to walk on an average property and has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking on to their property and trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't workouts where all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down this\nIs one area where Trump has an unlucky hasn't on fulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march\nAnd

let his what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are gonna put another way what what is the peril democracies in right now this is like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this or it's just rhetoric it's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant\nYou could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\n\nWhere do we find these Democrats\nPoor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there they're fascinating leftists there are people you can talk to I I Know people were anarchist and I love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in\nAt least it's worth engaging you learn something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all nonsense\nBooker and Warren and Sanders and bite in none of them have anti any intellectual heft whatsoever it's remarkable when you think about\nWhat ideas do they stand for redistribution of wealth defending our democracy that's not that that's not a policy solution is an interesting people have been talking about that for a very long time and get them very far\nI'm going to do is very bad things happen\nBut there's there's just nothing that's even we're listening to most of these people about Bernie Sanders has a kind of charm at a A N authenticity that comes across 'cause you don't go from Brooklyn so I looked him 'cause he runs with people that I Know from Brooklyn and\nYou know you hear him talk about these things you say okay well that's not the sounds like he's well intentioned but then when you started to get the things like math you go well this isn't going to work this is crazy it's a really bad idea\nSame thing with ... what does what does Kamala Harris stand for whatever the Democratic party ... what does Cory Booker stand for same what does was with once and for basically the same Bernie Sanders' same Joe Biden I don't know number one in a CNN poll recently about who they think's going to run for president\nThey've got nothing\nAnd I think that's part of why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent weather attacking people why they're hurting people\nBecause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans and the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic incoming are actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all they can do is get people angry and telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where all talk to you or some what about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators who are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate\nNeed a new mattress no problem ...

want to put a check on Trump ism\nDo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because\nShould the Republicans maintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate there's president will not only be unchecked\nHe will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking hold civil war in this country has renamed marriage and people use that

TV a lot of MSNBC though what are you saying isn't true by the way\nWhat are you saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of Windsor ... or something but it's not just droplets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not treating it as old as only\nTrump on the ballot first of all every single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should be the guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that uh but beyond that\nThere's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last\nCouple of weeks last few weeks\nThat could change this election I must tell you about it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell ya I had a I had a chat with Lindsey Graham last night spoken for about twenty minutes we sort of sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up ... we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real\nLindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh but here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game because you know the Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather [noise] uh you have the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging has healthcare help to your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to the\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently\nAnd what you see is that the cabin all effect in any state that's read with is a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not going to fly that's not going to work\nUm the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in\nA elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue they want Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nShowing very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls writes great\nBut in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh\nYou can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority and they're already have all the lives the American people\nAnd cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their think about what that what really happened they thought that\nStop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just due to a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is they didn't anticipate that in a lot of\nClose fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women are furious about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist you already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't\nMatter but if somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know not not in ... with some of what Trump is dawn ... but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the water\nThere is just going to be really close Isaac could she'll go to the Republicans would feel like a miracle but it could still happen\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh is critical [noise]\nI've got a cup of it in my hands right now my friend black rifle coffee I'm drinking it black\nBecause it is delicious coffee in fact I've turned a bunch of people in my office and just in my day to day life in the black rifle coffee drinkers once they tried to realize that this is as good as any coffee you'll get anywhere\nAnd on top of that it's a company that you will appreciate it veterans that run black rifle coffee and they found that by the way and now they're all about patriotism freedom and delicious brew all day every day I start my morning off [noise]\nAnd it's you know it's very early I start my morning off drinking black rifle coffee because I think it's so delicious and I know that I can have it delivered to my door so I don't have to go shopping for coffee more good black rifle coffee dot com slash book you'll get Fifteen Percent off your or that's black\nRifle coffee dot\nCom slash book for Fifteen Percent off black rifle coffee dot com slash bar [noise]\nGuns goblin spend which\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports book ESPN was people live for and onto the show for only for Ninety nine to bring thousands of events\nIs going to be the very top level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a short memory could be a human source right we don't know\nBut if you're going to have proof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can you know say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely\nHow how you got it [noise] ah so I don't I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that\nThere is a very real possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one 'cause they're going to say that it's just\nSomething that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that and got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us ... they pump pay Oregon\nTitle for the Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that so that we do have some understanding of the facts surrounding that which point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nSurrounding Mr it gets the first of all the number two we I Belong to a site teen thirty two long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partners\nTested in the two holy sites\nForeign changing\nAlliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount just fly off the handle and decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can make all of at our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear to journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have\nNo basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team unless one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish ditch\nTurkish sovereignty here I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the consulate so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be\nAn investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who\nWe think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this\nI Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get it but if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kind of riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play a clip ten oh I can assure you though\nThere will be consequences the vice president says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences\nWould be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want to major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in\nA lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes\nOn in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these things which I mean that was happening you beforehand but you know what I mean it was going to be a really\nBig step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power\nLet me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach in Saudi Arabia right now only do so with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then it starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not a prickly wealthier powerful one\nOf the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East Saudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there\nEgypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems a new look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping the place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war\nAnd you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government because it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say we want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh\nGetting shifted around a one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them plenty of people who are the loudest voices on this\nThe Saudis you know murdering somebody and their consulate in Turkey and so this is a very bad therefore for dissidents Democrats around the world\nYeah it's it's always transport you see there were no dissidents\nThat were being murder urge before Trump came into office there were no totalitarian regimes that all Trump created all these bad things these people are really crazy\nI mean they they are at you know sitting on the subway talking to a toothbrush and asking when they're going to have dinner together level now this is getting out of hand\nMore worked up over the Canadian milk and then he was ever could show you it's not\nIntelligent for the president to be worked up an angry Africa show gay and chilly at least give if you want to jump out right away as they suggest they want him to and say\nThat Saudi Arabia is responsible there's going to be huge consequences and I'm going to personally yell at you know Mohammed bin Salman\nIf you said you know the Saudis say see they won't even let us do the investigation they're lying there trying to pin this on us this isn't true you can't fly off the handle right away you need to look at what you guys need to look at the fact that it's not it's not like ... has been kidnapped and every passing hours you know he's gone\nHe's never coming back\nSo people that are trying to create this rush this rush of action from the United states in response to this that's that's not how we do things that's not how it should be done here\nBut others go even further than max and Max Boot of saying well but this trumpet so cozy with dictators all of the world a he is ... is basically responsible Steve Schmidt who I I think is\nYou know I've said before me and ... is one of the domestic political commentators on TV but Steve Schmidt maybe dumber and it's amazing having seen\nHaving seen how he's the hero in the HBO movie about Sarah Palin's an ill fated vice\nPresidential run and they see the real difference he was a\n... I still like with the judge and the Republicans and stuff and you know murder you irrational and stuff in\nHere Steve Schmidt Len led you here let let let you hear how close the impersonation really as fortunate\nIs the leader of a faction and he is dividing us and those divisions will take years and years and years to here we are one people\nWe are one people we're on the American people and when you say a president in the United states doing where he is doing to this country not to mention\nThe unraveling of the U.S led liberal global order that\nEmerged from the horror and the catastrophe and out of the death camps in the ruins of a war that killed eighty million people\nHis delegate to democracy is Neal is the deputy chief small L liberalism is not there and you see it with his complicity in aid is complicity in the murder of a Washington Post columnist by a Middle Eastern thug\nComplicit in how complicit you ... how is he complicit what the heck does this have to do with Trump\nThat was on MSNBC they should be embarrassed that they would air that kind of stupidity complicit by everything he said was wrong everything's oh he doesn't believe in a box of really Trump gates shot down by judges\nIn the Ninth Circuit left and right over ... it's ridiculous but you know he gets okay well see one court\nHow was how was Trump destroying democracy how she'll do any of those\nSmall liberalism you mean like cutting regulations and cutting taxes that's that sounds like small L liberalism just the\nEverything he says it's not true is an\nIdiot [noise]\nDon't want to say mean things you just dumb\nDoesn't know any international relations either like I should stick to like\nTalking on TV about that [noise]\n\nYeah that was you know because when it comes to the place we saw him was tough [noise]\n\nThose are saying you got time for it when you say the Miller is appropriate and independent but you can't answer Congress question about something you said in a meeting with the deputy head of the of the FBI at a time when he was frankly acting head of the FBI could listen tell me had been fired by the\nFact that Rod Rosenstein was a no show last week it is something that is just not right he's obligated\nAs a guy who can from when the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asked you to come to Congress in ... he were obligated to do that and you're supposed to do with under oath and he was a no cell yeah he's got signed this ought to the press about the Mueller investigation of voice\nRosenstein thinks that he's kind of a law unto themselves folks deputy attorney general guy overseeing the Russia investigation really has no problem acting like he is part of his own branch of government and really he's running his own branch of government that branch of government is the F. B. a\nSeal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or\nTo get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash\nTag resistance and Trump does is to just not worth getting rid of them the ... resistance would come politically and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a ... a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care you got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how roads and saw once talked about wearing a wire drew record President Trump you know I really do believe that what if when I was a little\nA little a little nobody CIA analyst if I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by secured by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're only booked two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or\nHas he look he's an Obama administration hold over\nAnd he's clearly very tight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough here's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a region ... testified for the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nTreasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence

eighty plus percent of our job creation as services\nSo when you're a service economy the way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy good as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to have a thing that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying into the government and the terror it's just another tax\nBefore we are close out here's one as a real quick here to get from the grade on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents is pretty good regulations are down and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing as subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and themselves who saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Walmart and\nI was gonna say Sears R. I. P. Sears R. I. P. but these are very different views\nOf what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul I'm well let me let me deal with Ron Paul suffers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to [noise] for Congressman Paul [noise] ah [noise]\nHe's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is a\nVery clear history of currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity is very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly\nNow that said Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't just say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have right telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happens and fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I just put his I\nPut his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that we're we're heading into\nWe're heading to a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look\nThis is I go home and I'm like you know what\nI I really wish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or you know deciding to just eat half a wheel of brie that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections in the economy\nDoes that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I also like American cheese on America Jews on my burger yesterday was delicious [noise] ah [noise]\nNobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that has to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate\nNeeds answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know ah that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action it just means we need to be aware that the action is not going to come quickly and we should\nBalance out what are what what what risks are accepted what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China\nI I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given them a lot of credit on the turf issue and um\nI've been willing to say that I ... I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists and I know that the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed the tariffs\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can that said ah I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to the economy it's been a ... a few weeks and people have ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy\nAnd that's that's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession we're they turn all this raise they've created on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction of socialist\nThat's what they're going to do that is what is coming\nUh so\n...

him the right people hate Ted Cruz and so you know based on his enemies that he's over the target and he's a\nConcern to them so I I always try to remind myself of that because you know Ted is not the most swath of of of individuals' he's not somebody that you would necessarily want to invite to you know hang out for a few beers you said that himself\nBut the left has this habit of taking people who\nAre just not that impressive and lose\nAnd then we have to hear about how will they lost but they changed American politics forever ... one of them this guy was spent thirty eight million dollars to lose a Senate seat in Texas wow you mean a bunch of rich people on the east and west coast who don't like Beto O'Rourke a or start don't like Ted Cruz\nMight have made this a national news story this is not exciting and all member Wendy Davis\nWendy Davis the woman who did that whole filibuster if I recall over abortion or she wore sneakers during it she had to stand up and she was so cool the whole thing you know she was she was considered absolutely amazing I'm trying to think it was one other person who\nThe left or just embraced was Wendy Davis and someone else who\n... who just got clobbered in the actual election but but they they'll say oh well that that person was just they were amazing anyway\nAlways trying to find a way here to just make it all seemed better but I just thought that was so funny ... campaign has transcended has transcended politics yeah right [noise] that's such a borrow from Mark Hemingway or ... or ...\nCaffeine that's a very grandiose way to say losing\nHat tip tomorrow for that one because it is absolutely true it is a grandiose way to say to say losing a buddy you know part of it as well do they have to create this narrative now\nSo that there's an inability later when he inevitably loses he will lose\nTo make it seem like this wasn't just the media fabricating this whole story I shouldn't say fabricating manufacturing right they manufacture they constructed it it's not that there was nothing there but they made it\nMuch more potent than it would have otherwise been because they believed in this guy because they love him because you know he's telegenic and you know as I said I mean he shouldn't have to worry about debates with\nTed Cruz 'cause you could always just flee the scene\nYou know that one oh DUI\nDewey so these call them why pig a little bit of that going on\nA that was back in the day so it's it's just another it's another classic example of this it's another instance of oh here's a candidate that the media just fell in love with and we're going to have to hear about this person for a very very long time even though they lost\nCause I assure you that this person is not going to win [noise] um it's it's just going to be one of those things and they'll say oh Jon Ossoff that's the vacuum Jon Ossoff that guy who\nKind of looked like pajama boy from the Obama ads and he ran in what was it uh in Atlanta and oh gosh she's supposed to be yeah no Jon Ossoff is not a ... not somebody that we needed to hear quite so much about well you know it wasn't wasn't even really that close\nSo that's what they do they decide that a candidate is worthy and then they go all in and then when it's not and they've been telling us oh it's going to be a huge upset you know just like with the Ted Cruz situation you'll notice this doesn't happen in the other direction\nTaking us back for a moment you media malpractice year when was the last time you heard a tone about some great out of nowhere really conservative candidate that really appeals to conservative America who is going to take some Democrats sheet somewhere\nAnd then at the end just got crushed just got crushed\nI Can't remember I Can't think of one place where that has happened so they may be getting bored of us\nTalking about how the media is biased but I Would just prefer the media stopping by us and then we wouldn't have to talk about it we're not we're not making this stuff up\nHow I see here during nightly banned her daughter from wearing a from a watching rather Cinderella and the Little Mermaid [noise] Ah yes celebrities celebrities don't like fairy tales anymore [noise]\nThis is now a movement it's going to catch on but some of these very famous very rich idiots will get into this and among [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nLeft won't try to ruin is there anything that they can just all agree you know what we're going to let that thing just be a source of of joy and an amusement and fun for people\nWithout turning it into an opportunity for awareness raising or social justice stuff or you know is there anything that falls in that category\nI I don't know what the answer is that right now because it feels like the answer's no\nThere's nothing that they won't pollute with their hyper politicization sports not sacred anymore oh yeah a SBN is now MSNBC with sports\nSo we have to hear from all these athletes about what they're different political opinions are and then if we say you know that guy is not particularly well informed we're told that were being you know dismissive and rude and depending on the athletes ethnicity racist so oh so we now we have to listen and silence while these athletes who\nHave no particular knowledge or political skill or background or lecturing the rest of the country about an issue right so\nThere's nothing that seems that really escapes but fairy tales\nYou would hope might be in something of a special category and I I think it's acceptable for us to think that you know fairy tales would be a place that we're all just allowed to say oh that's pretty cool\nBut no that's not the case Christian Bale who is a a a very attractive but from what I gather not particularly bright or a wise actress\nIs concerns here according to parents dot com concern that Disney Princess is Cheech daughters bad lessons\nThis is the sub betting on the piece when it comes to stranger danger and conversations around consent frozen Anna has a lot of questions for Snow White um she says quote\nEvery time we close no way to look at my girls and ask don't you think it's weird it's no I didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple or where she got that apple I say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right\nWow a good good job with that one you must be really proud ah and then\nThe apple question is not the only one that bell at Disney Princess herself as the voice of Anna and frozen has after reading the tail quote don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission bell says she has asked her daughter's because you cannot kiss someone if they're sleeping\nOh my gosh you know you know what else you can't do a eat a poisoned apple and go into a coma for many years are you there what else you can't do hang out with like seven magical dwarves in a little hot in the woods like it's a fairy tale\nIt's a fairy tale you would think that they would just let this go\nBut no I I've heard other people talking about this to this is not just this is not just Christian Bale know now now even Disney cartoons are going to come under assault from these social justice warriors because\nBetter economic opportunities dog browse for assault so what do we do with them well ... what we have been doing with them a prior to the Trump administration's return some or out we we we either they're from Mexico they returned to Mexico there from Central America we fly back to Central America\nReally that's not actually what's been happening at all as you know you see because they come in here and they claim asylum even though they're not supposed to be eligible for asylum\nAnd what happens then\nAs soon as they cross the border and there are stopped by border patrol and they say oh I Want asylum you know what happens then\nWell I get into what I play a little bit more of this is important for you to hear because this is the thought process this is the danger in Washington when people
