then they talk about we want an FBI investigation you know why they do that to you\nSo you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those are real live criminal investigation now there's not\nThere's nothing to do with the criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested that two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that\nDr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not what it\nIs Ramirez does instead we get reporters we get get people giving their opinions we get this I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators\nLaying

better how come they didn't say\n'cause that that's why\nYou're here this now on Fox I'm short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK\nI'm used to this but it's an important point\nHe said because in a court of law there's the cabinet does that the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law that's a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt\nBut as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set\nIn her paper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum\nAnd everybody's gathered 'cause now the lines are going to kill the Christian just throw Kavanaugh in there from in their everybody's excited everybody cheering\nWhat do you mean

that you\nUse nibbling moron\nOr judge lego whoever the hell that in retrospect Kavanaugh using a girls' basketball\nTeam as a prop during his confirmation hearing doesn't seem like a coincidence

always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations\nWould not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland not one and I'll tell you something else\nOne of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation\nShe would lose even on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence\nIf he sued Mrs Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and his crime they would lose\nYou can accuse people are the most vital things with no evidence with no witnesses it no core operation\nIt's a slam dunk not might take a few years but they know he won't they know he can't given his interest in still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit\nThese accusers and their lawyers and the Democrats in Congress fear the legal system the the legal system in this case\nAnd they

what are you doing\nWhy do you want to be scared and I said honey it's it's part of feeling alive and she goes okay All right now rich or you said you're up in northern Jersey you're kind of in a mixed area there are some conservatives in that part of the state and there are some a whole bunch of blue people do you blame\nI'm In I'm In Sussex county okay\nLast conservative strongholds where just south of the border of New York Cuomo went in and and you know we're the minority in this state\nWell I hear Bob Menendez is in trouble I hear the senator from New Jersey who's up for reelection is having a tough time do you think there's a chance he could lose that seat\nI'm so I'm hoping he does I mean all the controversy with Jim and you know it's kind of obvious\nYou know with that or Medicare fraud with his buddies and you know we have enough a corruption like to see some some fair the scene people in office that aren't just about Greek\nWell I think the hardest thing about a politics today is any good person and scared off by what we've seen with\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and how they've taken a good man and ripped him apart over a Beijing is allegations from three and a half decades ago so why would anyone want even go through this is Lindsey Graham said doesn't make any sense show\nMe any teenager young guy college guys is very normal you know to be attracted to girls may be misconstrued the drinking playing around\nI mean that's more to more normal and say like you know rumors about lenders and people like that are going on private aircraft and you know with children and things like that whether it's true or not you know we'll probably never know\nWe will never know but let's just hope judge Kavanaugh gets a approved and then pass through to the Supreme Court thank you rich in New Jersey appreciate your quick check in Memphis, Tennessee with Randy Randy welcome to the bucks sects than show how are you\nHey good\nSo ah Randy you're a guy who says I got a scary movie is it scarier than neither the living dead\nI I've got an a or a water is just because I thought when I was probably four or five years old premature very I'll ride my land probably nobody's heard of that one\nWell rain will land for those that don't know it was one of the ... greatest actors in America\nAnd at the end of his career he made a lot of B movies including a one with Rosie Greer retired football player where rainbow lands head got transplanted onto Roosevelt careers body\nAnd it's one of the cheesiest horror films you'll ever see\nIf you if you haven't seen it\nYet I'll look a premature burial but you look up I think it's called the thing with two heads and its Roosevelt Greer and rainbow land and remote land also made a movie called the man with the X ray eyes which was another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it [laughter]\nYeah that was only on my list because I saw it as a child but I get a real one is I have some\nFantastic good one Seventy nine yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I I still go for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes\nUp a [laughter]\nWell good good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got to just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know it gets out and votes\nAre checking in I have time I guess to check in with John in Delaware has a thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware and when I'm listening to you like that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover ... northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I enjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived in\nDelaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservative so I'm up in the blue part of who say\nThat but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it ... ... but there's a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the hope at Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot at the shining it's currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind you\nGuys I I just now started the show believe it or not um on AM radio and and there's ... that show just started about ten minutes to go round that\nOh cool well in our our on you guys so I'm just now catching I thought they show just started ... and\nNow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining Islam ethic\nIt is well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that the Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic characters shift you have to like the guy first he was weird for\nMe to you did actually he came off a little bit scarier maybe a little bit psychologically stable and the stats and my correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but uh I'd ask John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer because I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nJust wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin Hood saw into wearing what he said today that the judge Barry said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying and is there any as the\nCandidate notice judge from Medicare a Chuck Schumer has got a big mouth and if we don't get our little boat and we know you know get out there for the mid term can make things right and keep\nThe way if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're going to have you here now for the next God only knows how long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are ...\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the head\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy a man and doubled his nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that I still didn't get to my network proclamation my my liberal network proclamation I Will get to it I promise\nPlus I Want to hear from you guys on your scariest
