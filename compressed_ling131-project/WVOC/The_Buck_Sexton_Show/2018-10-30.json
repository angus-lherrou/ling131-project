caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do for the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just a beat to let the American people more than\nThey make this about Trump\nThese people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective\nYou know last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy who had already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and that a a a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals\nBut they say that Trump is basically responds well did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself and not Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that\nCrazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was\nThe reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro markup paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America let's be clear that that means that natural is responsible no matter who engages in a hate crime against anyone else\nYou know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremists let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's from small because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because she as implicitly encourage them they'll say if a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there is violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness at it's at the root of it all ages crumbs fault they say this is delusional\nAnd\nIt's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time\nIn ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I'm I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live and breathe politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they what will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric while saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents let them beats you into submission bludgeon you into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to do with\nTheir calling President Trump an anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Crumpet is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law is Jewish humongous converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close\nBut they say this the media says they pat themselves into that oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know\nYou're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this it's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hate the president\nWho just five is his position for Jews decides\nBe violent engages in his in his replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did\nAnd that's in a guy trying to attach Trump to this though it's just so intellectually dishonest each show unfair and it just goes to show you that\nThere is there's no effort in good faith there's no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for it let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault by the press drives I I agree with Trump\nIn the press does drive a lot of this\nBecause the press is full of a bunch of preening\nSelf obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know is ... book you're in the media the I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nTerrorists sympathizer I mean given the way the he responded what happened in Charlottesville given how he responded to show the given the fact that he he puts what's happened today and through this week and the concept of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have leadership\nIn this country when it comes to domestic terrorism this president foment but uh as much as he is occasionally for speaking against it a\nTerrorist sympathizers you MSNBC politics editor calls the president of United States\nHow much more stupidity do we have to really be subjected to before we just said I I just don't want to hear from these from these idiots anymore I just I just can't I Can't handle I Can't even pretend to engage and here there are arguments I I feel this from friends of mine they say I'm just sick of it and I understand the feeling sometimes\nYou know and I spend a lot of time drawing a lot of left us and it is it is no easy task these days you know what this really comes down to and this is what they don't want to tell you\nThey know that they are not going to win the Senate and they know that the house is going to be tight and the left is aware\nSomewhere deep down that if Trump was anywhere near this monster this caricature that they've been saying for all this time\nThen Trump should get blown out\nHis party should get blown out in the midterms right it should be wipe out in favor the Democrats what does it say that almost two years into the Trump presidency who they say is a traitor and a fascist and a bigot and a rapist and all these horrible things what does it say that the party that has led by that guy\nIs going to gain Senate seats and almost even though it's an off year election hold on to\nThe house of representatives\nHow much more out of touch\nAnd diluted can the Democratic party be is actually the question they don't want to have to do it's\nJust so much easier for them so much more satisfying to say that it's just all about how Trump is a race just at a terrorist

Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there are no are there is no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him and Andrew supporters\nTo all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this evening\nHatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement date they despise the voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but\nI think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now\nSo they hate us because of all that and that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always on the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's\nAh never validated that uh what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he was explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump's condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that as America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for\nWill not stand for your ... [noise]\nThe greatest president in my lifetime with the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes well see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet\nUnion and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record\nTo compare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for you just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system\nOur principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all starts\nAnd so true\nAnti Semitism and true racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism because\nIf we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the nail in a bubble rights and if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth as human beings\nAnd as citizens of this great nation so when\nThe last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves on the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave\nAs elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to\nBeat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that has an obligation on all of us\nI'm the one that when they try to make\nThis case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's\nShow on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics\nBut it is useful for them a it is a shame that so many of the classes\nThat the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them\nThey really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that and\nYou and I said you knowing that that is a lie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with\nWith race and gender on these other differences among among human beings are when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear\nThat our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get show there I said triggered when it has brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers said if at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths\nAbout human beings what is always true about people what is always good for society\nTo promote and what does always\nNecessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at\nThe heart of conservatism and so it's just feces sees act opposite of\nA true conservative [noise] to believe that the first thing is less than because that's how it is a person is less than as a genuine less then because of religious [noise] that is not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that and I know that that I Do think\nThat it is worth sometimes taking a step back and just\n... exactly why that is the [noise]\nThere's a lot of faith and frauds out there and a lot of very easy and clever ways for people to try and falsify their records and who they are that's why if you're hiring or you're renting

in the media saying oh my gosh it's so crazy to suggest that there's any one organizing this and do they want us to think that this is spontaneous and oh by the way they're really gonna walk the whole way uh\nWhat can you tell us about the organization and also how we started you see folks hopping on buses and trains for at least part of the way because I think that's a pretty predictable move\nBuses and flatbed trucks we've seen now I'm pushing people through Mexico\nOr to get to to get to the U.S border even foster because apparently there's some elections coming up and and you know as much as these people really love foreign intervention and foreign collusion uh this is literally a you know up to ten thousand foreigners latest estimates around seven thousand\nUh but you know could be up to ten thousand foreigners who are being bussed a to the U.S border to to impact the election cycle so to make it that you will\nBut the groups in question here I mean media does sort of

P. R. C. down in Houston every night Mr Jesse Kelly ... have you on\n... to be your book either do it rather\nA show or you know I I'm always a little\nFrustrated 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always a suggestion of oh why do you bring up armed guards as though that some crazy idea or you know I've\nI've seen plenty of armed guards and or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed by the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist dismisses this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's where it gets dismissed for simple reason is because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target\nHas an armed guard at side of it ... that's\nCalled security that's the norm guts the real world\nBut even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place\nThat generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting that Sarah Oh it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms or you know I don't know or or another congregants I should say river arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think he just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement\nThe last thought that ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic Cuba because you were CIA you have comments that you you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of any kind or for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nI Know I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also\nWere a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there but you know you you look at at the the cultural differences\nIn the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts\nWhen they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it they've also been raised to think or they'd they'd been led to believe by their peers and those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the state are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who aren't part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nShe knows she's not supposed to let that out right now she knows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go there and not supposed to be you know it obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game\nBecause she comes from a damaged political brand\nUh but you can't help herself Hillary Clinton\nAs I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there was nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views yourself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive cause politically speaking\nYou know she stood beside bill she allowed so many people to uh bash are all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her\nIn her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done\nIs if she becomes president I'd states and I I've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record here what happens\nIs that the Democrats if they take the house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes the whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary presidents finally to break\nThat leg\nAnd finally put her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states I'm I'm not\nThe only one who's thinking this Hillary yourself you could tell it's like well\nI mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than I Am I mean this is this is the kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it that's where we are with us she she has not given up\nOne bit she still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story and her mind it's got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do with her ... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess that\nThat Trump created and oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much so in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next year or this coming Tuesday may now yeah next Tuesday that's next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nNext Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats I think about what you're going to have a huge field of candidates on the\nDemocratic side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have an ... he still thinks that or does instill thing that he's going to run I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really beat anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidates see I I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there Elizabeth Warren\nProbably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump all that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how\nHumiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupts\nClip Democrat Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be social is\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be\nOpen a Seventy percent tax rate kind of\nRedistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive government intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals\nAre that's going to be with the next elections all about\nA ... with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump or his or just getting crazier and crazier you know they they'd gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred and I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about it because he's such a weirdo and a show in significant\nIn terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only ... was to get us into wars that were or at least in one case very bad idea um but you know he he'll just slander Trump with stuff like the ten\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman there been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros is there a rich through and so when they talk about Soros they're talking about\nA rich Jew who's in control of everything or when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump southern Kobus rightwing extremist here germs physicist those\nDog whistling which has gone assaults and you're right it's not just profits a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks that Fox News they really everything that he ... by the\nWay everything people don't refer to anti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor that's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global list it's some kind of dog was a global is is a term that's been used in international relations\nAre for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter was a global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at him referred you historically that work for you then as global have nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism\nUm but booth realizes that if you're going to go to the other team but it's not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despised Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from the left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies\nI don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with a known now and am ideologically in line with and later just turn around because it was convenient for me and\nCall them all races [noise]\nWhat creature is Max Boot discussed [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had been real\nThis is the foot of taking out loans using books home as equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies today\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host titled the instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down they don't title may already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free title scared and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title locked dot com [noise]\nBring up traffic and weather report morning's news radio five six\nRios in\nPenalty possible blindly ...

that has you know I've been talking about for a long time here\nWhere we you know you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservatives stature shock\nNo one out but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite soft line they can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their their the cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different\nView of this uh in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be placed the Thirteen job\nYou can be radical outlined\nRadicalized online has already been supported by\nThat's that's we believe that after nine eleven when people had access\nTo ISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize Jeff isolated individual as we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all have agreed with that and have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context and in particular case of powers\nYeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what if a speech what is not hate speech and is that foreign policies on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them\nAny leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be\nA situation where conservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's\nEffort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and you know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets to pose in photos with rock Obama when he's running for the presidency remember that oh that's right journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there um but Farrah Khan is still treated\nAs somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets\nBut here's the kind of stuff that minister Farrah Khan says play fourteen and one to\nWhere you recognize say\nAnd one where you see the same panic zoo\nAnd the synagogue of Satan which has many races in it\nBecause they want to see the whole world\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd complete\nWhenever you read that God\nHas told the Jews to hear an old bay\nAnd they said I hear and I didn't know they\nOnly disobeying God\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the St panic Jew Farrah Khan says and he's still somebody that prominent Democrats\nCan hang out with an public Ken Ken speak with whether it's commentators were politicians\nUh you'll notice that you don't have Democrat presidential contenders asked the way that the way the Republicans were asked about David Duke a loser that nobody cares about nobody you know gives it you know what to hear from\nAll Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do do do do do do just about David ... why is it ever Democrats you disavow do you disavow Louis Farrakhan\nWhy wasn't Brock Obama asked you you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton nasty you disavow\nCirca\nOh that's right you mean the media is dishonest and there are activists and there are so sensitive about an hour because we now all are figuring out the truth\nYeah that's right that's what I saw\nYou know it's not smart just sort of post and stuff on the Web and you've got a

know can be legal and it depends on the circumstances are but why do we even have that federal agency but I think that's a better question why not just abolished the ATF\nI don't think it should exist because I think that when you create a federal law enforcement agency that has as its mission arresting people for firearms violations for example and and that that's a specific mission set that it has it's going to work really hard to try to find people to nab\nOn firearms offenses and there's a lot of\nComplicated firearms rules across the country you know I have had a fair number of people over the years federal lecture me on how oh buck it's on you as a legal gun owner to know the laws of the state your Internet\nOkay true but guess what there are some states where even the police don't really know what's legal and what's illegal because it's not clear based on how the laws are written\nHere's one for you in New York City if you have a hand gun permit futile legal premise permit for a handgun and you want to take it out of the city and in New York state does New York state of reciprocity depending on who you ask I've got a totally different answers about that\nI'm ... and then when you out and do it the practice that New York uh was engaged in for a while I mean I just know the gun laws are the best 'cause I Lived there for so long where people's flights were diverted people whose flights were diverted think about that you're you're flying from you\nKnow Chicago to a Miami let's say and all of this would be a pretty bad route you know ... you know you had bad weather on the way to Miami so they divert your flight from New York\nAnd now you're there and you have a hand gun that you checked legally which in Chicago to be hard enough as it as well let's just assume you checked it legally with the airline you unchecked because now you got to get another flight the next day when you go back to check in with your next flight they've arrested people for that\nFor not having a premise permit for New York city and having a firearm in in New York\nThey've arrested and they know that that's why that's why they had to go so I'm just saying that they they look to penalize people I mean there is a an aggressive attitude about gun owners that some law enforcement agencies and I think ATF has very high on that list that some law enforcement agencies or adopt in a way that is I think a puts them in tension\nWith the constitution and and it's really problematic but even with the hog and these others about the good it just gets so boring after a while\nThey they know that they're not really going to get this ban on farms the guy spoke today from ATF I remember his name doesn't really matter he wants his solution to the gun problem is to have all semi automatic rifles all semi automatic rifles because as you said a rifle that can\nKill a deer can kill human so that's what he said all semi automatic rifles need to be licensed at the same level that I fully automatic rifles right now that's his new solutions so you might be hearing that\nMore and more and I said oh do you really think that I could get a fully I I live in DC do you think that I could even get a fully automatic weapon here no matter what I tried to do no matter what my background is and he didn't know the answer and I said the answer is no dude\nI was just kind of shocked 'cause I work the eight year for twenty five years and seems like he doesn't know the gun laws that well which was surprising except for the fact that he's obviously an anti gun sell
