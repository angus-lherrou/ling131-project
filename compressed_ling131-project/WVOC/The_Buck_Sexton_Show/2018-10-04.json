Fox News new details in the shooting of police officers and sheriff's deputies in Florence county boxes the Rapaport has more line\nClear proof one way or the other factor it in\nWe heard so much what oh she beat a polygraph I shouldn't say well that was maybe forty and right there she was cleared by the polygraph maybe you could say polygraph said that she was not being deceptive she was being truthful what if she knows how to be to step up on a polygraph\nIf she knows how to do that by the way that would indicate that she lied under oath and if you lied under oath about the polygraph\nThe way I still don't believe that she took the polygraph not knowing she was going to come forward so I've always thought that was a lie but if you lie under oath about taking the polygraph than\nWe know that she's not delusional then she's actually a malicious actor here and given that we've been told including by sitting US Senator is that millions of lives are at stake\nMillions of women's lives are at stake if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court which is insane thing to say that it is pretty widespread among Democrats\nWhy is it so hard to believe that somebody would try and do something that they would view as a great act of heroism and that they will be heralded for on the left for generations to come for that act do you think that that's that show and think of all\nThat's so not credible really I find that hard to believe\nThose who today we're criticizing Trump for weighing in here seem to forget that just because there are allegations are now falling apart it doesn't mean that the rest of us have forgotten how disgusting how disgraceful how underhanded they have been all along and their efforts to try and derail this cabinet nomination\nThat has been their purpose and they had been willing to do anything and everything in order to get there\nThat they're now in a more defensive position than they have been\nYou know ... I saw how to another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties where there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties I mean at what point are we just putting highschool drinking socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ... there there is no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah I Know I I I'll swear elsewhere testimony out that I went to a party long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not going to get in trouble for perjury it also doesn't prove anything\nThey ... the left should keep I keep running into they should be ashamed about how they have no shame and they view this as an ends justifies the means to a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here this has never been this has never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom\nEnough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to this is where I'm the most concerned as to how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has\nTo get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around Trump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to\nA great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as ... came across to me it's very strange it a little disturbed\n\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my past or I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically am a ... completely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegation\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford\nSituation will notice the second or the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweating ec they barely even discussing that any more\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she said and as we found out with her near as and in the third case was sweating it it's an intelligence test watch that interview with Julie sweating it where she's talking about gang rape and being an\nIn community college and hanging out with high school kids all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful don't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if\nYou think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment and analysis are ah are lacking\nTo say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gap there is some whole there's women who were lying are we to believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is Oso honest\nI have a hard time believing that now we can speak

he's a judge she's a sitting\nCircuit court judge you supposed to be nonpartisan\nThat part of the race that's judicial thing you can do the show no judicial temperament but we know one thing he does not have the temperament\nHow can he credibly on the court and claim to be impartial with temperament like [noise]\nIn the late ... painting full of parties and ... on the table\nHe showed a lack of judicial temperament someone as biased and its uncontrolled in his range temperament it's just that city really made me question [noise]\nFilled with rancor and re animates and arrogant and I think that\nThe kind of temperament is reflective of those allegations as well just sat\nIn his anger is triggered and what we saw today is someone who you can see attacking a one ... it's very frightening\nI don't know if he needs all believe what they're saying or if they're just saying what they think is going to get them the most to claim on the left but how do they think that somebody should react to being called the gang rape is with no evidence\nTo having their their life ruined on national TV the reputation destroyed every well what are\nThey really think you sit there and saying yeah you know I'm Sorry I just disagree with your assessment\nRemember that he gave an interview and the week where he was very measured very calm you know ... ... even ... the whole time on Fox nursing ... you know a guilty person I mean er an innocent person reaction speaking to\nSo that he goes in there and he's like well the fix is definitely in um at least going down fighting and gave me an incredible performance and what it really is is they're they're just they're just now acting like a bunch of spoiled brats 'cause they didn't get their way\nThey thought they had and they thought that at that for testimony he was going to get his nomination was going to get yanked and he came out there and he stole from them what they thought they had just with all their all their little schemes and their coordination behind the scenes the left media the Democrats they all thought\nThey had it and then Kavanaugh's just said nope not yet\nNot yet\nHis his temperament is bad he's been a judge for how long now it's been a ... he's been on the D.C court of appeals which is the second most important the second most important cord the country after Supreme Court and its Bruce or

you have to school through so much stuff doesn't get credit for any of that though there are there no one sitting around saying oh yeah you know he was really it was really cool about all that you know I mean you know of course of course not\nThe thing about cabinet as you've seen how not just the narrative but the way that the media covers these things is always damned if you do damned if you do\nYou know Kavanaugh is to me and ... and a little too subtle what is your sponsors he's guilty Kavanaugh's too angry Jew Jew a fire eater sponsors he's guilty is because they're not assessing their not judging anything they just have to\nThey just wanted to not be on the Supreme Court and they know their audience in that case the media doesn't want to be on the Supreme Court so they'll say whatever they have to say they will pander shamelessly an orderly hander with all this\nAnd that's what you see happening here you senator or Portland for a corn and not carbon Cornyn is a\nPointing

putting maximum pressure\nOn voters Democrats\nRunning for the Senate\nIn states that Trump won\nYou know this makes a ton of sense assuming Collins and slate and Murkowski are playing ball you think they're planning bar\nI think that they are a rush why should they looked at the report and a flake in college I think are on record saying\n... this is a definitive report this is a good in depth
