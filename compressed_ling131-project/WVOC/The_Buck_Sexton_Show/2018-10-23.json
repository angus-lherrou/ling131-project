request from Donald Trump sites agency if they provided the pain or requests were you honored as governor\nWere you worried Donald Trump proceed with your time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when somebody is five and I'm probably older I've worked with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted that maybe they serve ten years\nWhen it comes time to come out there is it the pain or requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options Andrew will not answer the question that tell me let me would be willing to release center out and said\nHe won't answer the question that was Gillum and dissent is a dissent is was the one who's pushing them on that issue both candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to you know trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say there is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really\nUh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee another person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about about Gillum\nAnd you know it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer and he wants to raise taxes but he won't say that you're laughing ... papers a bunch of things and you know we'll find some ways but just that this was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained a request\nAnd noticed have Gillum would not answer because what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do notch\nAnd now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered you or do not own her eyes to ... what that means is when someone is already\nIn custody of law enforcement and immigrations and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody day Sunday detain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of\nDeportation they refuse century city jurisdictions refused to do that\nAnd what descent just knows and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes are violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these chain requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested\nUh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it how they would be stone wall we refused to help you as a matter of policy right\nOf Senate race that I don't think you get nearly enough attention you got the NATO obsessed

great to be here All right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that while the entire media felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz's is not like pulling away from paid off work\nThere's a race it's even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez when\nYou mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather modest by his colleague back earlier this year I'm after he had been found to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud down the government an all time\nI'm not only was expecting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat change the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Cuban Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving a favor\nHow'd you say there's a a deafening silence Kim from so many of the au Jared Kushner most time some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I I hear this people to meet all the time and I said okay well what is it and then there's there's nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump\nMeanwhile Menendez who I whether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not and what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping that Bush has gone on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi that are actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point about how they supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and all sorts of other issues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes to that in some cases actually are outright helping them you will the Democrat that's why I call the called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats just decided to re route three million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race on night or taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to unseat\nOn and places where Trump won um because of you so much trouble the ... in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I get there is all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can to return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving to one of them is on this\nUh as as on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but do you have so many Democrats you start thinking of all the Democrats that have gone to prison than the last oh four or five years for incredibly obvious and very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion\nAs I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone started telling me about the ... that tends to be what I hear about\nA but also on on the notion of mobs I I just say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have\nCivil society we have to pay it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nDeathly nothing written in any of that formal or informal rolls of our society they give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added hounding at a restaurant\nUm is it the fact precisely why we have a ballot box in elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there anyway and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think we all know that's not\nTrue I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street and it's not and that's the best it got and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make her production and who really knows but just in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic UC right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which you won't hear anyone to mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can say with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down to five feet one way or the other right on whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation game Kim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon ... back\nYeah I think he was spot on there with the it's going to be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time\nI'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who controls the house I think I'm by the time this show is is over\nUm I think it's going to ... well I guess the polls closed around ... there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue reports a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chases people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nAnybody that shows up at a Trump rally ... hat\nYou've got all kinds of nonsense going on about the post Kavanaugh raised from all the

C. and they really think that there's a national they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... of and Solomon where they could to cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on earth despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who was bowing literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the no I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him but the way they're talking about it but it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile it's anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean they in American conservative Lebanon attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this just the fact\nIt is just the if if it were someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered in but they're you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the cause Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam\nI was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth\nHe wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't deny this if you were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso uh that they dress the somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of and leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plant to disappear him and they are just really\nDumb about it let me give you a little bit of in jail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you know the regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are their primary concern is ripe regime and keeping the people in power in power and\nMuch I Love you too thank you well you know there's just so many [laughter]\nRock star amazing ... that's a reporter got the Mike and the whole thing you know star really\nThat's what you say to the the guy that this is your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter uh uh from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left\nOr or even in the main the quote mainstream media is down in the middle of journalists the big lie but they still couldn't do it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump from like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do is a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got ... ... says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all I don't I none of\nIt I'm like hey guys you know Kayla gay and you know sounds okay and as the old saying things strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess\nThere's a ... a myth a kind of\nMixing here and their minds of that\nRunning a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and coups charisma saying that Obama had so it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together\nUm and I think that is how they view which uh I think that's kind of the the the way that because they're obsessed with\nThis guy and I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true\nThey know he's going to lose going to lose by double digits off until he's a lose by by nine or ten points\nThat they think that a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red states\nAnd he can take on Trump\nAnd I'm here to tell you that Trump would [noise]\nCrush him so bad do you live

would not be sweet ... germs going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separates the Democrats and Republicans at the end of the day\nBut Trump is incredibly powerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well which is the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore\nThe legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is them while Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness\nAnd it really is it is moms or jobs and Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay is that they could be stronger honest\nBut on health care I'm furious with Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage and Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means what it does for them\nYou know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue on the Senate

actually more on 'em and and I know this is the thing that happens but I you know here's some guide and Wesley Lowery at the Washington Post he ... he wrote over the weekend after this Mitch McConnell saying\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to see journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLiked it fully brains clip everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is it is protected speech but that's relevant\nBecause they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment can say get out your trespassing is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of\nA of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump and I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right\nIf I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak and a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but in a restaurant no you don't have the right to go into a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he was the right to go to a restaurant and play your\nYou know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties poop [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I remember how cool you were high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want a big speakers then you were really cool\nI always thought little speakers were much more static we pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and one of the speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the we are we're not really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy who's to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird\nBuddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that's such an a to Z weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music you know that that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange um and I think that you know it's\nIt's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was late at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it um\nBut that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd Philly brains thing I wanted to say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any on his political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me I'm increasingly said over the last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was jar\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of Tron trumped arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian
