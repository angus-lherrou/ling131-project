campaign I'm not in any way taking credit for his victory please I'm not that presumptuous I'm simply suggesting to you that I Know the people who did it\nThey were not particularly active in politics they liked working with me they found politics to be somewhat enjoyable they wound up working for ... campaign Hogan wound up winning\nIn a huge upset in Maryland He's up for reelection this year\nYou

Fox News those comments from Supreme Court justice by cabin on the White House ceremony today boxes de France aboard has more lively\nAnd going into his second term after he beat Romney just thinking to myself what is it that so many of my fellow Americans do not understand that I had to wrestle with Adam grapple with it\nSo much of it was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands and he rose to this occasion so to Capitol I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLess ... has turned into a kind of mass panic a widespread delusion a collective nervous breakdown each\nNo longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey after bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they after harass people in the streets chased him out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened the docks their shoulder\n\nThere was word over the weekend of senators who had been a ... with threats against themselves against families against grandchildren\nOf senators\nA Fox anchor was talked into the subway we'll talk later on about that a writer for Stephen Colbert bears crappy late night program\nTweeted out that she was quote just glad we ruined his life about Brett Kavanaugh you had protesters clawing like crazed animals at the Supreme Court doors and yes you even had Taylor Swift come out\nIn favor of the Democratic party in Tennessee T swift how could you know this used very serious a vision is something quite different or the left has lost it\nUh they they no longer seek to meet us on a battlefield of ideas we're reason even plays a role nowadays emotion it'd slogans is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding deal blue to ration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades\nThey don't want you to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally with sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts\nAnd that triggering they think justifies violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital\nAnd notice there's really not any gloating there's not an endless victory parade going on television there is in the sense of\nNow that we've beat the other side in the war let's go round and bayonet all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on there are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had but also in the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation\nBetween who you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics and who you are in your day to day life I don't mean that you don't leave your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to only exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to focus on things like treating people with respect acting with honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to sneer at things that pop culture dominated by the left residuals\nBut you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the self\nTo show up and scream about how ... will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril because\nProcess is still respected in the Senate\nBecause the presumption of innocence is a principle that we have maintained\nUnderstand this is they have gotten away with this plan if the left and managed to sink Kavanaugh it was the beginning of the end of any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that\nOnce the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation is the verdict and because they were deprived of that secret weapon because the less isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown click with all of it\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThese people are on well\nIt's not just that I think they're wrong that their ideas are bad that they would be destructive to the country where there to be implemented that's given\nThere's something different now we're not arguing over what the top marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument has to do with whether the last ... defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is we're instinctive impulses\nLie the end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged\nIt's just not going to lead to good things for any one is not going to lead to happy places for this country and I do fear it's only going to get worse because instead of learning from their losses the excuse them with delusions\nInstead of recognizing that the American people are not in fact on their side\nThey take the position that they were treated you see it was Russia or it was that big mean meaning Mitch\nMcConnell or it was some other thing that they conjure up to explain it was the electoral college now they say the very same people who for about a year and a half\nOf Trump's presidency have been saying he's undermined institutions he's destroying our institutions he's undermining our democracy they say this it's seared into Vermont those same people now openly proclaim we need to tear their system down because Kavanaugh was on the Supreme Court\nWe no longer can accept what their system produces for politics this starts to sound less and less like the voice of opposition and more and more like the voice

she ... down we have a print sense and they entered sense in this country and when I look at the lack of fairly corroborating evidence including\nNo evidence from her very best friend who is president at the party I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her as say and what\nHe's trying to have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and completely question that story struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice on that if somebody who is\nPretending to be a feminist that that is fake feminism\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that is she Hillary Clinton or no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department thought she was I'm sure she's friends with Clinton too but notice how quickly\nThey will just attack attack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermines the power structure\nIt's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left the hatred that much more because you are more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think why did that person go\nSame is true with radical leftist feminists they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh maybe\nMaybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to\nMaybe there's something else here um and there were there were some people who came through not just Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others\nUh I I gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gambled\nWith the Kavanaugh nomination or by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it they would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's certainly seemed\nLike a a cowardly move at the time to me that said when push came to shove flake did the right thing here at the moment he had to do it\nSo I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either\nBut he deserves credit\nMansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real West Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical leftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their case\nAnd then that brings me to Murkowski\nNow I don't know about wait wait before I get the Murkowski\nHi can I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um you know North Dakota is should oust high camp at the ... possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now\nMurkowski is not somebody who's ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she'd she pulled the stunts and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure it out or take less eating out really Mitchell figure it out later\nI Hope the American people are accountable um I Hope that the people of Alaska K. E. N. I. up in the house you're listening to the show alive I Know you guys up there in Anchorage give you a high five\nI Hope that you do everything you can to mobilize and make sure that she is at the soon as possible moment no longer in the United states\nSenate for what she did here it's not just about the ... for for me to the notion of having a conservative on on the Supreme Court that's important sure I'm not going to pretend like\nThis is like you know the answer to if somebody asks you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to each somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant and harassed them because of their politics answer that has no it is on or quickly without question\nNo but\nShe won't say it because she knows where she to say that\nIt would offend the left it would offend the activists the Emily ... cows skis and Amy Schumer is and others who love to just pray and you know listen a lot of love the parade around and get arrested by the big mean police and the whole thing this is\nPart of their political culture now the shrill ... the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the the public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic on the left now\nRight to have really a a nervous breakdown in public that is what\nLeft ism has become and you notice it here and this is we've had all these different examples you know your real Rand Paul have as well rather Rand Paul's wife wrote a letter about how not only was he attacked and ... almost beaten to death\nBy a lunatic left wing or\nA who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know labor dispute is hater Rand Paul attacking from behind them was killed him he had pneumonia he was terrible pain and that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter tried to shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria a\nHodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter the name you should know the left likes to forget it very conveniently\nUm but you know his wife wrote about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats\nAnd prominent Democrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack on Rand Paul as though it somehow funny this is something cute that they should laugh about similar disgusting\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost\nIt can't be ... based because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problem is when you're fighting against the left is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have nothing to begin with but you know Brian kill me\nIs a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian I work in the before I I Know everybody in conservative media at least by reputation is not knowing them through work Muslim or personally I Know everybody by reputation\nAnd Brian is universally considered a by everyone I've ever spoken to a really nice decent guy\nYou know whether you like his uh his owner persona or his analysis you that's that's a relative he's a nice guys are supposed to be a really good I don't know ... only work them or the other people I could tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always been ... enjoyment or actually\nEven if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass\nWhich is not the let's just say he was he would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was Stockton harassed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know are there any other kind these days activists comedians here's some of the audio from it play eight\n... where's your accuses sexually harassing\nYesterday on everyone\nOn the news that the\nClosest person from the front right have you know what I mean do you want Donald Trump\nOr do failed this guy 'cause he's the only person in America that Donald Trump Clinton [noise]\nRight we are criminal creator go down\n\nAnd you think about what you're doing you're doing it\nNow I don't know those idiots are and when I can tell you when I say this and I say this knowing full well at some point I might have to come on air and explain to you that\nYou know I got into a a a scuffle and a lot of these media types you know they\nThey think that there are you know impervious to this kind of thing I think that there's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with\nSome a left wing hack following\nMe into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy each different in the halls of the center it's different in a public space a public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference you waiting for waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside their home\nThat's weird there are boundaries year but this goes even beyond that\nBecause not only was there the the ambush interview component of this dinner was the following him into the subway so that's really you know you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this just following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car\nPublicly trying to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard that Brian kill me there's a racist what if that person got I'm Brian space and want to pry and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if a Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt\nThat's not a hard thing to create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians or creating a combustible situation they are creating a scenario in which would not be difficult for there'll be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nThey don't mind that they're running that risk you start to think that maybe that's really what they're pushing for this is who the leftist become they won't deny it they won't shut this down they won't call it out there are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and

[noise] you know we don't all I see your eyes you lie and I think much hey maybe I'm an Indian\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the left\nWants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets\nAnd I'm hearing more and more from our swamp sources that their plan really is\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary me as much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be Warren for twenty twenty\nMaybe Warren and then a a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker but they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career we're not for racial fraud\nRacial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that you get into a whole lot of trouble\nYou lie about your race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at Harvard Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse the whole thing I mean it it should it seem it's embarrassing\nAnd there's an Elizabeth Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things but here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this\nShe has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with our racial spoil system\nI did dish knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this was ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough but technically I caught technically a qualified no instead she pulled this whole high cheekbones\nAnd then we're supposed to pretend that somebody who went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nAnd unless you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing\nYou know Trump is incredible at picking these areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up an energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winter for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL kneeling for example the left thought oh and these different players who obviously or kneeling uh but the media narrative around this was oh the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this thing up you know you guys better stand shoulder because Trump understands that at the end of the day\nA vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown flak more so than that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas he knows that the left\nIs going to jump into oh my gosh she's being a racist why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really like the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I beauty and the beach to a great movie\nThe original or will be like it's not a radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox so great it's a great cartoon if your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's\nA cartoon they're making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he calls Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised they jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just\nNormal people who are not emotionally destabilized left is what we hear is why are they why are they defending Elizabeth Warren being called ... where\nYou know she's not a Native American right we all understand so why do they act like this is some big slight against Native Americans the point is she's ... she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Polk honest is probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nAbout the era coordination and how it was a matriarchal society you know they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who there's some really interesting were vision is out there about a native peoples in America and how both technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not\nMastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of their political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the war in thing are we calling her Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on the show\nThe less deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they are taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snapped them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked and ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful tool it's very powerful a there's a reason why we still know the names of people like\nSamuel Clemens Mark Twain why we know the names like volts hair because of their ...\nIt was their security powers right in in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was with one must be going to point out

core Ocasio Cortez was a darling of the left now\nRefers to left is in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching when I pointed out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and try to mock them all that's fun to hash tag on the lips it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump ah\nBut I wasn't even the the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got it\nOh you I've always there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live\nYou know we'll do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they knew exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly we're talking about I mean that clip is\nIt's timeless truly great\nUh there's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa like such as that young woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in a in a way it was the Miss America pageant a thinker miss team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and an ... using the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing whatever uh but I Know I caught myself\nBut Ocasio Cortez had a moment\nThat reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play a clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider and among them watching people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that was what what's what's your plan [laughter] well I think\nA lot of them are choosing our strategy around with that now there's a lot of baseball and inside the beltway here that term thrown around but there are very ... organizers little Congress and I hope that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy\nAnd what it is really about organize all [laughter] Oregon I think on some level of strategic in our late ... brings together a cult status pressure on the shoulders\nOf any kind of only focus on a pastor and puts it was really interesting thoughts [laughter]\nJohn that's really interesting I Love your job is going to be a a thriller type style laugh I'm running [laughter] what do you rather that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook but I quit because she was like\nThank you very much ms Tennessee likes you leaned in and do this like deep voice announcer man big after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she starts talking about organizing can you do that because I I don't want your whole thing again I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organized side the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair I mean that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation public education in pursuit of\nPersonal political uh goals\nRight it's not just whipping people up into an ... style mob there's something more to it than that but then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchies the patriarchy and ... and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton do this resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang\nOcasio Cortez had us uh R. E. S. P. I. C. T. we should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nThat was one of my favorites uh anyway ... record says this is the the great\nThe great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for\n... openly advocating for socialism catchy defined socialism now but like she has an economics degree or because you define Marxism\nNo cause she tell you much about marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the rights group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of difference and that's what you see happening here uh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way and advance and you're like ... come on counties great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's causing Trump because of the Republicans that are in charge now and it's I think it's gonna keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock the socialist and these leftist in the Democratic party because\nThey sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind or they will reason through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention to knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people or people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling\nThey just want to talk about how they're\nYou know ... Marxist and redistributing the wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences\nMy concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of corporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate debt structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations\nRising interest rates any massive\nUh well we have a trillion dollar student loan debt which is a problem I don't think it's catastrophic problem but any of our troops ... trillion dollars of debt and you have rising interest rates and I just see that at some point you're going to have a cyclical reset\nAnd that's when all of a sudden when people really get ahead and unemployment picks up even if it's cleaning out the system in a sense even if it's just a necessary part of the economic life cycle that's\nWhen people will be open to the idea of socialism in America not you not me but there'll be a much bigger swath of America wants to hear about free health care free college free this free that the rich will pay the ritual pay\nA and I think that day is coming\nI think that historically if you just look back I think there's a a a historical cycle that we will we will enter into here I don't know if it's gonna be the next two years but it will occur in my opinion during the Trump presidency because Trump's and the president for eight years\nThat we have to be on guard for and that's why the educating of the public\nOn these issues of the economy and government interference in the economy has to happen now and we have to stay vigilant we can't just mock we have to also tackled the arguments on the left about socialism because when the time is right they will make a real play for\nGlobal verification networks is the answer to all your background investigation and vetting company needs this is a veteran owned and operated institution my friends when you are hiring people for your business however large or small your business maybe whatever field you're in you need background investigations done\nAnd you want somebody that you can trust that does it quickly efficiently and does not outsource or offshore the ...\nYou clearly said we want quality not quantity\nOf ... I'll go oh\nWell like my mother taught me at first you don't succeed cut your losses and run by God don't find your perfect local employee at Columbia help wanted dotcom local jobs at work Columbia help on a dotcom present so world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't huge there's no jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date [noise]\nThey didn't know where we're getting applications from jugglers in tightrope Walker\nSoldiers posted on a national jobs aren't there this job can be a balancing act and you have to juggle many tasks\nBut the job is for head of accounting some of the applicants include a lion tamer ... have you met the guys in accounting their animals\nDon't be able to find your perfect global employee at Columbia help wanted dot com local job work\nMiracles talking on the news one month before the midterm election what\nDo you think of President Trump here's an embarrassment worldwide you have\nTo admit kind of a lot of things in this country didn't know there has to do\nI'm not a big [noise]\nI'll go out in a row\nGive them any money but I think he's doing it they don't like him at all I Can't believe each president for\nSecuring their borders lowering taxes increasing our military he's the whole gamut God Bless him\nThink he's been fulfilling a lot of his agreement or\nI'm finding is that he made you want a\nKind of pushed the ultra conservative values [noise] and ah\nThe the broad population isn't really going to go for that we'll see what happens in mid term\nI think I think they can take the house [noise] and I think the Senate America's\nTalking do bomb Institute of CPAs and the ad council\n... ... ... ... that we can laugh and countries ...\nPass apple valley [noise] got so much for ... yeah on a ship for high ... high as\n... like I said that ... and [noise]\nShe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nI almost forgot to say everybody [noise] half indigenous people's day yesterday\n... All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus Day right okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because who really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know\nNot really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus\nDay off work today off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry borough I mean I\nUsed to the John ... you're you're the rock of Gibraltar of team hot man you were always always there for us\nYeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just not a not a serious holiday you know it's not up there with the ... so I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio\nWhere lots of fun things happened I'm sure they are not celebrating Columbus Day so they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus Day there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think\nTo be consistent or John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town\nRight they got to rename\nThis is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names and then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole ... in DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nIt is like Chris ... you mean update on the committee chairs\nOkay so you were talking about what happens if the Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let them have how you know how to speak because uh the committee heads have\nSubpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slob Jerry ... taken over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nIt would be terrible I mean\nWhat I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if jury ... learn an see below sea and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of it even if we got a new Mueller out of the picture oh jeez\nThey would they would just keeps a painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be non stop investigations that when the house so we\n...
