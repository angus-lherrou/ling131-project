I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I was one declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch\nIt might have spiked it\nI don't know if any do saw or how many of you saw the Jewish wedding interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony she was the second woman didn't testify just gave sworn statement but the Ramirez allegation\nBut hold that thought for a moment\nSweat Nick is the one who says the Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweat it also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be mistaken I think she's a very troubled woman I think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us that she's got her she she just happened to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think she was issues completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said\nAnd as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people go into prison I with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is to be paid and and might be making a mistake that's\nDestroying someone's life here's just a part of the kind of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate well it's a third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady stories that you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all these leftist females who are coming forward\nAt a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons or we're we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation it's a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity\nHand in the balance hang in the balance and day a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nHannah [noise] well I tell what happened what will happen to me I didn't put ten and gather said boy far outside and we're congregated together sort of like a ... [noise]\nAnd I think what is that correct valley for al ... a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or anything or wind definitely huddled by Dorie Gunn over for what it could possibly do ...\nAnyone to get their way here watching that were\nBorn in our whole room for outside the door\nOne thing that I say when they have [noise] I Would say [noise]\nI I it's just too cold battle\nSo I think we had something ... we we got we have crossed wires there for a second but ... sweat next talking let's now look at what she says I don't have time to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because she's just a liar I I can tell you what she's lying about\nShe's saying that she thinks that there were gang rapes are she's making the allegation that there were a gang or it's going to these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party or teenagers or you know having drinks Avon fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere's nothing about what she says it makes it as a game of she claims that she was raped and I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks rape or\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but is it wise you bring in his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then 'cause he happened to be at this party I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know this\nIs a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense\nShe went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes to punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of what that means but that means everybody's getting really drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little added a little boost to it to make it a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't roof the the big bowl of punch because that means you'd be roofing himself and all these are guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you drink from that too it's a bad idea ... story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication that that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too\nComplicated it's you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they don't\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she\nAdded that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kind of she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of cabinet she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was\nCollege not long ago that would be considered strange and she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls were being roof each and raped gang raped\nThe call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right or a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be much stronger position to take action or would futile much stronger position socially when they're part of you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying in an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster\nAnyone's still believes this really turned into an intelligence test because you you can't J. O. know emotionally aren't really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say\nTwo thoughts on this and then when we got we got so much more to the Senate Democrats are they're scrambling to keep this whole thing a lot because they know they know now that mortgage older credibility all their decency they acted like total ... to try to stop cab and all they know that\nI Wonder if they do manage to stop him and they look like even bigger clowns in the process\nNow they've exposed themselves but still early we've got a few days left who knows what they've got up their sleeves when you have no dignity or under protect you got a lot of options that's what the Democrats outlawed option\nSomething I Want to note on this they\nFor yourself to all the best player with a gas station all in one habit rocked up every ... doctors bought family radio original vision my only experience\n\nSpecial people make the middle is a special place to live there the CEOs who make our businesses thrive find out who they are as we showcase CEOs you should know every Tuesday and Saturday morning between\nSeven and eight and I heard radio\nGary Davis recall space better because you know that up is sixty percent of the indoor air you breathe comes from that crawl space\nOh it's a health issue and it's a money issue to ignored foundation and structural issues will only get worse to become major expenses robbing you of the equity of your home healthy\nHome starts from the ground up call call space better now for your free poll point written crawl space inspections coal eight six six eighty eight ... or log on to ... dot com you tell them I sent you you'll get ten percent off the coast ... eight six six eighty eight call\nThis is how it's called for health a major step forward for people who can't take steps forward using an electrical implant research has enabled people whose legs are paralyzed to walk\nThe researchers at the Mayo Clinic worked with people with spinal cord injuries\nThey provided electrical stimulation and three test subjects were able to take steps they were unable to walk without using a Walker or holding onto someone but they were able to control their movements deciding when to move their legs and when to stop when the switch was turned off the three could not walk and the technique could not work with all test subjects\nBut as researchers tinker with the procedure they hope that\nFor some patients limited walking will be possible and the electrical stimulation may help patients rewire their brains in spinal cords to basically learn how to walk again\nFor more Health News go to Fox News health dot com has called for health I'm ...

might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some room mate or doesn't like look you could find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they'd probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever the trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college is they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're a conservative\nEverybody loves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think Collins realizes that she's done and the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression and that's my analysis I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more\nTransactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concern and then you also have this is continuing narrative and its ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch for flake you see they can't get\nKevin on the rape they can't convince any normal reasonable person the cabinet was above the gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no evidence\n\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from\nHawaii there is the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to criticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about the developments we found out overnight even leave the dollars with the ... and ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for someone is in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations and for its really are about how it is\nSo that is very relevant and trail of himself as actively choir boy\nI'm very much contradicted by his late for example in college and some people who knew him and I go why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from line for like ... ...\n... what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that\nShe can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being harsh on her\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but this\nStory about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and you know it was a ... bravo and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our two\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into the incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious near times doing a peace right now on how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day and in New York Times doing that base whoa\nOh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had\nEmily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he\nPoses to civil rights and women's rights I'm sure to\nOf course that's that's that's a given you could assume that\nBook by creating the storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other that's all about\nGetting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree by the flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing all that\nFlake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's going to end up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing\nKnowing that yeah I still receive a lot of viciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger is not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from people but he's playing the long game of I Want to get a book or a book deal\nSimon and Schuster or whomever you know big big big publishing house that's that's what flakes game is year\nSo that's why I I'm concerned I I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence in the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to redo from it\nBecause it is salacious that you could definitely say it as it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dot CA but it did\nI I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man are there things in there essentially telling you the sweat Nick is a very\nDisturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's\nThat's the bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard\nThis line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nThis is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're eight eight collective\nVersion of justice or a collective is to approach the justice that's at the heart of all I Want to address that when we come back and they don't talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our going into the economy and\nYou were looking for politicized injustice\nOn the next episode of their thrive global pod cast with Arianna Huffington vice president of ...

on twenty sixteen the geo pie in the\nEra of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election I don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up and be mad mad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on\nThey're likely or to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well\nWhat are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\n\nHave to stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that it\nCould go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah no no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate and this is where everyone starts saying the same thing it's an eternity in\nPolitics Bob well Jill it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundits is not telling the same thing as people keep asking me I I don't I don't know I certainly hope they're probably going to win but and you know what they're probably going to do it it's not like I think the world's going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nA way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for\nAll of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem with the Democrats left they get show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me\nOr you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the geo peas in a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job ... not not\nBeyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening and that that's one point I wanted to make your in terms of\nWhat we've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact I it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said\nAnd that means preventing Democrats and taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight\nThat's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they are going to agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital's a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nAre the women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it have Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find sign they were never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ...

person is doing is the more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what the easiest thing for them to do because that's what they're gonna do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just a vote\nFor a cap and I want to get him out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that wasn't gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTapper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThe Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of Kurds that is called cowardice but notice how this is framed\nThey're trying to you and this is very all top are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who are going to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's seductive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life to be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nIt's like didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in for men this hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process\nWho when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen or East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that\nMade sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a ... so what did flake do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw ... funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interest in power in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been climbed\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently that's what Jake Tapper\nDoes know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to be able to go and get a contributor shape at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nUh what did the process here of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage bags want to note tappers got an entirely wrong that's not surprising you know top are always on the on the cold there show always so hip and cool\nThe whole thing over and it's a fraud and staffers

tremendous amount of change with regard to trade and how industry a is done and what people are buying what the consumer markets are\nIt's time for this deal to get updated that's what's really happened here the president managed to pull it off any one else will be ... there should be considered a victory but it's Trump\nIs Trump and so the response is always oh well it's not you know it's it's not good enough oh he he didn't he didn't really manage something that's as good as\nYou're being told that is of course told that his by people like me in a a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming number of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you that Trump is a bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's\nDoing this is what they'll tell you I'm this doesn't square with the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference which stands for research some of you know them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands or is it it's a great group\nI learned a lot about investing in finance from them I really enjoy working with them but they bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto currency and investing and all kinds of things are just a whole slew of its three days of a world class experts in speakers I brought my\nBuddy Sean Parnell out this year yeah\nJohn did a great job if you ever get a chance to er here Shawn tell the first major enemy contact the ad in Afghanistan maybe you'll have him come on and tell us that story as kind of fun I'll I'll sit back\nWith all you and just relax kick up my feet on the desk to be like oh Sean Scott story time for us\nBut I'm speaking of all these different people who are\nVery involved in the markets economy and they have to be right now that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV are out on a ... style of a conflict of members oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical at Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking to\nYou will just capital Trump or saying you can't disregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing\nBut you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that's just that's being unreasonable\nThat's not looking at the evidence and making decisions based on what's well\nMaking coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here or there and there's some other stuff and I know has been said about Trump in the last day or so you had to a union leader or union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks place Thirteen\nThanks to Mr ... tax rate farms and then on general\nConfidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and grow our company in the last year were investing more in\nIn play wages and ... says we're spending billions on Clinton and I said and and\nCentral Asia thing a huge increase in and work coming out because utilities are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure\nSo thank you very and I made a huge impact\nLooking to grow about ah twenty to thirty percent more and places and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and then we'll make I think a big difference and really it is and ... that are good for businesses are really important for our employees also the community is working and we've\nReally been thankful and had the ...
