the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz so it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron does scientists for governor for years after endorsing Democrat alright\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently is a Democrat but it is a serving out of the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote\nThe men and women of law enforcement want to tell for audience that Iran does say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the border police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police had been scrutinized for doing their job and kick to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted

being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I notice that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly theories that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist\nWho has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor endorsing round is saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen five\nHundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and for about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes it is a specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started this theory that I did a couple years ago\nAnd

important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the public and party is a party of a bunch of old white guys\nWere you at three women featured you couldn't see I'm Joni\nErnst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and

Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the ... not all of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman delivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that\nThe um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart roe v Wade years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait so you have brilliantly stage brilliantly written\nDelivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time\nSo after all of the theater\nThis week after all the circus like atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an\nEpic finish so bravo to you GOP bravo to you and to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for ah\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I talked to\nGuys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar\nAnd I don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a book or\nWe call a cocaine was\nReferred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called a stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what's far to all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating\nMr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened\nChris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nA Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this all of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats\nIt said when you go out and develop all of\nYour missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth\nThis year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays this time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks for that wants to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't that Chris Matthews\nIf you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about\nHillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts\nWhich was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great in grades\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a a good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity it's an absolute\nEternity so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interest of those of us who are conservatives who want to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election\nIt turns history tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that we share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you\nI Know the other day I asked\nA question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum\nAnger at the worst jangle ever and I know\nYou've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing or you can ... you can say however you want\nBut when I hear one age seven seven cars for kids I Want to stab my radio one age\nSeven having cards for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today\nAnd then there was a massive round of applause for very long round of applause in the Senate\nIt was a very emotional day and I'm sure it was very emotional for people\nOn the other side and you know it's an interesting immediately following the announcement of Susan Collins we had Joe mansion running running to hand the press\nHis statement that he is in fact going to also [laughter]\nI it's almost too funny and then you hear this morning mansion called the White House early in the morning\nAnd said that while if a if Susan Collins votes I'm going to vote for him to some you know that that's a good thing right Mr President you won't come and do any more rallies in West Virginia against me because he's trying to retain his seat in a state that Donald Trump won handily in twenty sixteen\nA very very red state that if a Joe mansion did not support this nomination he would probably have a tough time so I'm sure there were some political horse trading they're kind of like the or\nThe brass got the corn husk or compromise that rock Obama used to get Obamacare across the finish line there's so much more to get to I Will give you a couple of other seminal moments from today and also\nThe protesters aren't done yet\nThe protesters who are funded by some pretty big people yeah I'm going to throw the Soros name out there are because one of the women who yelled\nAt Jeff Flake last week a woman who got into the elevator and was screaming at Jeff Flake get too she works for yeah she works for a nonprofit social justice organization that has been funded to the tune of millions of dollars by one George Soros\nAnd CNN gave her I think in uninterrupted five minutes of their time today\nTo spell her guts and sell her story I'm Sorry we have to take the mask of these people and point out that

to justice Kavanaugh\nOnly one out of forty nine that's not a good thing\nThat really is not a good thing but there is good news on a new poll out of Fox that says are the things that are most important to people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention to date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to President Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent

John in Pennsylvania also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how are you doing I'm All right yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I see one of the reasons why there's British research into a cheerful is because it goes to the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so popular people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians to here say they want they're doing something else never followed up all sounds good come up to election but when somebody actually scripture and our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare event\nAnd I think she tapped into that raised by you know ... some of the consistency usually people look\nAt the television and they're just like you know why or why would suddenly there why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people will be drugged her rage stuff that anybody would an ounce of common sense\nThis has to say you know this is an out of one thing I could say the media is so complex and I hope these people never get a little power I looked everybody goes that votes coaches voted out these people vote at the media it'll it'll drive him crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] it's a great point any jingle you want to share with us a bad jingle that haunts you\nKnow yeah when you just said that that other guy I was sick and one after the by hand

Sexton shows or\nMike what at night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShoot a great job should rich have look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and\nWas telling her I feel your article beer and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nCan't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the raiders were very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party and not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one in the guy had we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fait accompli is not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized there's still hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the stain\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who are you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family I think those folks need to find a way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm cheerful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case\nEvery battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut yeah I Am nervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\n[noise] yeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election and\nI understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm going but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country to look at the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kind of felt this is a moment where if my party just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox News you know they give a big huge hug and I've\nBeen a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never Trump worse and it's come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promised\nTo support a constitutional is\nA Supreme Court justice or then we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and conservatives most of that coalition or or conservative I think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt at a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also all over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you want to told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland\nWas attacked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together and that's why we're where we are\nYou're a hundred percent correct he just out of credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that is ... you\nKnow not done yet a tomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee tickets shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rough just wait to get the next with because an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so was the tactics\nI I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up ... millers autobiography\nAnd read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds and different opinions and I think that's kind of the mole that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nThan

George or a hundred percent correct\nAnd part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves but Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nDana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it\nWe don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution now and uh I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws or reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the point in a more judges that are getting confirmed at a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at Kavanaugh I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so that\nYou just do the judicial

independence thought and and do what you're saying now that was an isolated case no just few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters\nAnd I think these lost boys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nHow do you have an ... ... ... ...\nI Will be I Will be voting yes [noise] and see the final confirmation vote and I will ... signed out to vote later today and\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that epic address tonight\nWho just some magical day and again I go back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes\nThe salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe\nBut no that's exactly how this works\nThat Susan ... gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she gave a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas a steady decline for more than Thirty Years' long I can only hope\nThat the cabin on Mondays and it's where the press says has finally hit rock bottom against this backdrop that sets the age of vegetables senator to decide what the constitution said five\nSenate consent to ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and mad said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely\nMake everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in her argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something here for used of doing something in this country we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence\nThan it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nThat prints sense in it then it since since relevant to the fight consent function when any accusation step parents from a nominee otherwise think sense blurry wreck\nI worry that part in it but it's ... cents and could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with these huge damage\nTo the confirmation process\nMoving forward\nSome of the allegations against judge cabinet illustrate why ... percent in a sense is so important I Am thinking in particular not of the allegations phrase by professor for\nBut if the allegations\nThat when he was a teenager jets cabinet dragged to multiple girls and use their week at a state that sound like a gang rape\nIn almost most amazing here is that when you think about it the apple pluck the behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirm judge Kavanaugh and most importantly\nThe absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he the guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that were debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a Ninety may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice she talked about this this wild delegation\nOut last is\nAlec case what's put forth without any credit supporting evidence and simply Paris in ... states have bother\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you could add Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally totally without any credible evidence and certainly not even a preponderance of the evidence\nWhat a brilliant day if he got a
