idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton or the promise to tax cut the the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake in the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside from it if you asked the man on the street name me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be\nBuilding that well and protecting our border and Republicans understand why in some cases\nBut Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you is because the Democrats stood on the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons it doesn't matter they've had the majority\nAnd if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're

they're going to make a much bigger deal of this this just came out today they're gonna make a much bigger deal of this than ah than they should\nAnd it's because of all these political reasons quote federal prosecutors in the wall Street Journal today have charged a Russian national with conspiring to influence next month's midterm elections according to a criminal complaint unsealed friday the first known case involving the November race\nThe Justice Department described Elena Alex safe now\nWho's ... who's ... and over while it's not an easy one of St Petersburg Russia as the chief accounting of an effort funded by a Russian oligarch and two companies he controls including a Russian company that's been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller\nBefore the complaint was unsealed friday U.S intelligence agencies had expressed concern over election interference citing Russia and China in a Chinese and Iranian countries trying to interfere\nThey added that no evidence that voting or vote counts were affected state and local governments prevented the attempts okay what I'm saying all along is it now if you're a foreign government that really doesn't like us\nOh you have to do is metal a tiny little bit just a just a little bit of mentally and you get this greatly magnified effect because the media wants to excuse the Democrat Party once an excuse for why Hillary last thank God it with a whole Russian meddling nonsense but\nNow that they've convinced a lot of Americans that already won election was changed because of this this ... this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that difficult\nAnd you don't have to be successful right because they took all context out of the discussion there was no longer did they change votes did this actually shift the election and any particular state or or in any meaningful way or was this just\nThrowing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge\nHow much impact that shift had but it did something and something means that you can always say the election was tainted now Russia or China or Iran any country doesn't even have to be sophisticated\nThey have the ability to with a minimum of any financial outlay with a minimum of of anything from there and\nThey can affect\nThe outcome of an election right they they can change how much a trust we have an electoral process and if you're looking to undermine democracy the great irony here\nIs that because the last thing the Democrats hyper ventilated so much about the last Russian interference campaign everyone that comes after this is likely to be in greatly exaggerated in the minds of a lot of people and\nNow whenever and whenever one side of the political aisle loses there'll be at least some faction within it that can say she change election you know that's what this election was marred by outside efforts to try to change things\nSo and I would also note that the Russians and the Chinese maybe even the Iranians they're going to get more sophisticated doing this to\nTheir they're not going to just stop at these are relatively ... minor and knock us space but campaigns\nAh some of the other things that I've been going on they're going to get more advanced but back to this this federal complaint that just came out today or this is what it says in the

we've lost\nWe lost so much of the ability to contextualize this ... and understand what really matters what's really important and and what not um they're they're getting way editors use on this

that they're in their minds this will give them an opportunity to energize their base and create something that could give them the last push they need to at least take the house in the in the midterms\nBut think about what the long term incentives up this are if we take this caravan of this character has brought in United States would say it's four thousand people\nWhy don't the next four thousand people just say yeah we're going to show up to the next four thousand people yeah we're going to show up to\nAt one point you realize you no longer have a legal immigration system worthy of

borders and end up in the United states for good\nSo much dishonesty and this issue from the left it really drives me absolutely insane ... they're never forced to answer the question who shouldn't be allowed to stay\nIf you show up and you look like you're sad and tired and an hungry at needy from a country that's in bad shape and I'm not saying no that's all that's all very valid but if you show up one of those countries do you just automatically get to stay because then we've got a few hundred million people that I think really deserve to be in America right away\nAnd Democrats won't admit this but they're unwilling to tell all those people you do not get to stay in this country um but there's been a confrontation\nOn the on the border this is from USA Today caravan of us bound migrants broke down a border crossing friday and streamed onto a bridge on Mexico's southern border with Guatemala in the face of a heavy presence of Mexican Guatemalan law enforcement officers\nAre according to media reports the travelers up to four thousand people mostly from Honduras were stopped on the river crossing\nBy the U.S space Spanish language network Telemundo\nSome members of the caravan became so desperate they jumped from the bridge trying to grab onto the makeshift rafts other migrants were using to cross the river into Mexico\nA unbelievable site on the Mexican border tear gas rocks being thrown care of and wants to enter not able to right now we did Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz Balart\nUh the network which has trout reporters traveling with the caravan showed Mexican police line up along the fence holding up against the waves of migrant trying to push past I mean this this is\nWhat this is a mob I mean it is a mob but we can call it whatever they're people that are needy that are hungry that\nYou know want to be in America I get that but this is a massive people and they're trying to overwhelm the border that's what they say is we can't process the mall we cannot deal with them all they know this and so they show up and this is really using our humanitarian impulses in this country against us\nAnd that's um you know you either believing sovereignty believe in law and order or you don't and I know it's so easy to say just taken everybody but just remember that as you look at what's going on and a lot of communities that have had\nTremendous financial strain put on them by the resettlement of illegal immigrants by are refugees that's just gonna keep getting to be greater and greater it's a function of mathematics books\nYou cannot have open borders in a

question we never get\nTo post that we never get to hear the answer is what we hear a lot of flowery rhetoric a lot of you know what we need is what we need a comprehensive immigration reform right what we need is an immigration system that works the immigration system is broken they say all that stuff what does that mean\nWhat does it mean\nHow do you fix it other than amnesty\nDo they want the border to continue being as it is okay let's not even get into it as\nSomething vis uh open ended and and widespread let let's take it at the very straightforward level of what the Democrats want when it comes to this caravan of people what is their plan\nShould the United states government say oh okay four thousand people who are just going to show up in a mass at the border shouldn't be allowed to stay in the country we should just bring them in\n... I I think that is what they say oh that the process or something they're all from Honduras from what we know they're going to say you know where to hundreds is very violent we don't want to go back we just want to be in America\nOkay and you say All right ... well you know we've got room for four thousand more people yes of course right we've got room for when you say room but what does that really mean\nYeah we've got the space is late we've got a lot of open space this country but people need resources and they have you know they want they want political representation they it's it's not just to be in a place it's also to be supported in that place\nTo say okay but we got obviously were very wealthy country got enough for four thousand people okay fine\nWhat about the next ten thousand you know that that that's not no I Would want to ask democratic members of Congress asked Democrats senators what do we do in the next gang that shows up is I don't mean gangs and like gang members but you know what I mean the next ah\nA group that X mass if they call it a caravan right this is the tournaments as they try to use a what do we do in the next caravan shows up of of ten thousand people\nOkay we're going to let we let them in\n... and the next ten caravans of ten thousand people each after that\nWhy would anybody why would anybody way years and years paid thousands of dollars and deal with all kinds of annoying headaches and I know they're not it's not fun and a lot of times it's not fair why do that if all you have to do is show up in Mexico\nWalk to the border and say I'm fleeing a very dangerous situation in my home country well what were your papers while I'm undocumented\nI Can't prove that well you can speak Spanish no no I don't know how do I know you're from Honduras or you don't but why don't we figured out the immigration courts let me into America oh I get my court date in four years great I'll be sure to show up for that one see then\nWhy would anyone waste their time right that this is the way to do it just\nGo to Mexico show up at the border but show up in a big group because of the optics of it which is what they're playing off of your are oh we can't turn away this big group that looks really mean now we're going to have a well we don't want to look mean immigration policy every other country in the world has a we don't want to look mean immigration policy\nOr other they're willing to have a we will look mean immigration policy that don't tell people you get come in every other\nCountries there's no sorry you know just get to come and stay here and they say well you know America is different alright there's there are other wealthy country should there are plenty of places people could go\nPlenty of countries they could go to um people in Honduras and wonderfully Honduras they could very easily head south and go to Columbia they could go to other countries that are not a nearly as violent right now I mean obviously there's a lot of violence in Venezuela but not nearly as violent is what's going on and Honduras\nCorps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of stuff all the hiding honey to head\nGames and then\nI think that's been around here by the outcome in Illinois\nAnd Alexander for the will Rogers Institute\nThinks they know about us\nPeople in our country suffer from the disease\nOr that it causes more hospitals lost work days as cool I suppose as than\nTightness in your chest and the ...\n[noise]\n\nKind of plan that Donald has put forth wouldn't be trickle down economics all over again I call it trumped up trickle down because that's exactly what it would be that is not how we grow the economy you can put\nOf Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorable that raises taxes\nHomophobic fall back as one of the ball back\nYou name it definitely advantage you condition then idol talk only to white people\nWay you want me to tell you what my husband my husband and I never said I Am\nYou know I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like anyone in honor what he's been through and what we've been through together and you know if that's not enough of people don't vote for him\nTo carry with you and I thought my bags\nAre concerned about my anything personally now I understand and as I said\nI'm not making excuses I've said it was a mistake and I regret it\nBy the way you may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat accounts ally that those messages disappear all by themselves is your wife is\nLike with a cloth or something I don't know well you know did you I don't know how it works this way at all\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now\nThe fact is we had four dead Americans what kind of a protest or is it because of guys out for a walk one night I decided they'd go kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make how much\nDo you miss hurts you you know we wanted to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you've probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show diluted and\nSo self involved in so self important and ... that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio he can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year\nRegularly that Hillary Clinton may run again and I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy\nI Know everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what I got my first time that I can think of at least in twenty Eighteen you have a top\nA Clinton aide Philippe Reines who is a veteran spokesmen and console year they\nAre saying that yes it's a it's possible here's resented political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or informal formal polling as eight twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before\nThis would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support she had sixty five million people vote for her it was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the death\nWhen asked about the likelihood of running rains responded is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they asked to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary wonder if I'm In telling all along\nThere's an entire apparatus of people around her who believed that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by\nThe Russians right they believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative is I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes she will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for who Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary\nBut this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that the case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational\nThen the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it they just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it\nAnd there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may have to do it again\nAnd they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance to Hillary Clinton runs right now if you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of\nTwenty five percent I'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious shot that she decides to run\nAnd mad wouldn't that just while\nWe can replay twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over\nAgain [noise] I mean I'm I'm a I'm not sure if people would do it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza and the good news is bugs\nI'm very confident that if that were to happen and guess what\nTrump would get [noise]\nI ... I Love doing this show every day because I get to share my thoughts when\nAll of you all across the country and in some cases all over the world\nIt's incredible but I also want you to be able to share your thoughts with me and with each other and not have to worry about left wing biased or\nAny of these social media moderators that decide that you're going to get Shadow Bear or you're just not going to see things in your feet anymore that are conservative you know you can't talk about guns 'cause that that\nOne of the second amendment oh that must be bad too\nNippy dot com is the place you should go to me that ... is a new social media platform\nThat gives you all the functionality that you're used to a posting reading to each other putting up videos putting up photos but it doesn't have any of that left wing biased nonsense they'd be dot com is totally free to join totally free to set up to post everything about it as\nAn I. P. P. Y. dot com again as an I. P. P. Y. dot com and also check out the ... [noise]\nAs summer taken a toll on your lawn\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports buff ESPN by force and onto the show for only for Ninety nine to bring thousands of a vet\nWith the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nJust some clarity some article of Ian\nWhy news radio five sixty jumbled you\n\nDennis and Fox News Saudi Arabia tonight confirming Washington Post contributing journalist ... show he was killed inside their embassy in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month\nShe doesn't sound very well adjusted to me is putting that out there\nWhat why why why someone who lives about his drinking and he didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his\nDrinking he said he drank sometimes sometimes too much\nWhen you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much is like way way too much so it's a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe is that would that qualify as perjury\nOr but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live at a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that you would drink too much sometimes ... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop cap and it was pathetic\nWhich goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from\nYou know just going all in all this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said to them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nYou would never occur to me and I know never heard of any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they stand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me\nNow I'm not saying to talk to somebody doing gate somebody and if you was an elected representatives go to but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation that this is not meant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted\nCruz they're mob and Ted Cruz this is what they do they like to foreign mobs and also reminded\nMe when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that\nI don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there but you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assaulted\nAnd that's\nIf if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves you know support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because something\nBad happened to me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced\nBy that that's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a\nUh I I was on trial for a stealing right I was in ... for fraud and people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was a\nWidespread talking point the whole capital thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not this is really elementary stuff\nAnd that this was a something that people are losing sight of a lot of people are losing sight of juice I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that\nThe king ah logically about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal Deborah due to the world and they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect\nThat other people will listen to them other people here are their thoughts and because especially on the left are so much claiming a victim\nStatus now when everyone's saying oh I'm a victim so you have to listen to me ah their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification and becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because\nI suffered some terrible tragedy it was very troubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality and to bring this\nTrump is saying here you know do you want people who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know this isn't a lot of endorsing of it but it's been not nearly\nA enough and I find that a fund that\nDisquieting to say the least so there you have it but you know doctors quieting\nStupid celebrities are all over the place you know there's all kinds of dumped celebrities everywhere or you're a Christian or Christian or whatever bell saying that Snow White is a cartoon character that gives or or is this story fairy tale\nThat a troubleshooter now because of the lack of consent because of the gets kiss while she's asleep in a coma from the magic spell I didn't think people are trying to dig any of this uh literally\nUm but it turns out it turns out I may be wrong on that when it turns out that ah that there are people who take fairy tales literally um but if we're going to talking about celebrities who\nI I don't know how it is that they are treated with as much respect when it comes to politics that they are um but you know we've got to get into a Rosie Rosie O'Donnell coming up here in in just\nA moment Rosie O'Donnell who has some thoughts to share with you that I'm not sure you want to hear but uh you'll hear I'm All right\nOh it you know we're talking about a feminism\nAnd and how toxic it is later on the show but I just thought this is a funny clinics this is just a quick quick throwaway see what I did there quick throwaway Kleenex is re branding its man sized tissues as extra large after complaints of sex is a veteran broke today\nOh and also you want to talk about corrupting mine's Cory Booker who thinks he's going to run for president in this country likes to talk about how great things are in Canada right now\nThat's not a surprise played up that\nIs why you're [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter]\nI don't know why\nNo one will yeah\nExplain why they're doing all those things Cory Booker because they're not\nMaybe you should stick to the silly speeches like I Am Spartacus and leave the the rising about investment and gross and industry and research and development to people watch you know what the heck they're talking about\nUh you know there there's a reason why people from all over the world by the way I Want to come to university here we're not Americans are like yes some of the university somewhere else\nThat's not how it goes everybody wants to come here so I Do think college is too expensive there there is a a component of this where it's what the market will bear folks ah and then he talks with recent development out American and us\nWhat does that even meet in in what way it's just these are the things that democratic politicians say because it sounds smart to not very smart people I don't know that can be kind of harsh but it's true\nIt's true the Trump approach is just to say very straightforward basic things to people that they know to be true to talk to them like normal people and they get it they're on board and then to take action based upon those commonsense things\nI I much prefer that to the kind of poll tested you know out America getting America or whatever oh my gosh Cory Booker only slightly better chances are running\nThe residency and twenty twenty that Hillary Clinton I say um\nOr or dental is with Warren lives weren't not Hillary

I think that's what the kids say wracked at is I I smell I smelled burned toast so they say when I play basketball when somebody would go by you in school I smell burnt toast um or broken ankle I heard that ankle break you know but\n... another version of that Nikki Haley there at the Al Smith dinner and talking about the Elizabeth Warren\nJust I don't know I mean the Elizabeth Warren maneuver earlier this week I Know we've talked about a lot about going to get much more into it now but that was the equivalent the political equivalent of being the incredibly Sean burned\nPudgy kid who in front of everybody up like the summer pool\nJust decides to go into the deep end get up on the high dive\nAnd first first time just goes for without telling mom and dad and just as one of those belly flop memory sunburn you know the belly flop when you hear in St Pete and just go oh I like it it hurts you to watch it and it makes that black sound that only the really bad embarrassing\nBelly flop can make the ... that's politically what Elizabeth Warren duty or you're just like oh my gosh what is wrong with you\nAnd she got caught up in a too but you should have gone back and seeing the the coverage they had on new day somebody's idea I Know I Would argue with the CNN exec on Twitter and they got turned into a few new stories of the few places because\nBook don't play it you know wants to try to try to bring the rockets they better they better come correct as they say because I Am not I'm not going to surround who do\nYou sure you're going to ... syndrome journals employees\nI Know what goes on over there have been over there um but but you know you look at a you look at what happened with war this week and she and I and when they started their coverage of it was just you know you had Alison camera like\nJune results of drop that sure\nOh yeah the results show that lives with word can do math or isn't very smart or both\nOr is just I think I think delusional if that's probably the most likely outcome there but Nikki Haley of did a good job at the Al Smith dinner and it was she had some\nGreat opportunities there and she took them with with some good jokes and I do think that her move all long hair has been she's good with cheese in good with the Trump people she's going to help Donald Trump won a second term she is a perfect candidate to run\nA once Trump has had a second term I don't people are saying pants I don't know about that I don't see parents at the at that level but and I've I've been wrong before us as everybody who tries to make these kinds of productions [noise] I was reading a British as I did say\nAnd when you say this to people who don't care what a person's raises don't judge them by their skin color and\nA lot a lot of women in their lives and treat women with dignity all the time and are completely respect for the women they just started tuned out all the rest of it because it's cheap\nIt's dishonest at this as a line of attack against Trump and against everybody around him is just going for the lowest common denominator and its mudslinging and place of ideas mudslinging and in place of policy I I had I had to laugh at that one I don't even know was with comedy is like\nThey're kicking monks full of let's say liberal tears drinking but I'll just like like my parents right now are real like it's like why are they doing this to me\nI Wish that they would also get a little bit more of a sense of humor a sense of humor that didn't revolve around mocking and ridiculing are Christians and a white males all the time I mean white males we can take it I mean the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberals don't have a sense of humor anymore and this is why you see these polls about political correctness and how anybody who's paying attention now is a political correctness is a cancer in our society\nIt is destructive it doesn't add anything to society doesn't make us better as as people it just creates a incentives to make politics all about personal destruction and also allows some of the most\nAnnoying stone faced on happy miserable petty people in our society to get to write and then rewrite rules on all the rest of us have to live all the time\nI've said it before it's really important Trump got a lot of support in the early days because he just said political correctness is garbage he just said it's garbage she didn't say oh you know we shouldn't be so politically correct but I understand why people are coming from it no no no it's garbage and it is\nSo destructive to society so destructive to uh our ability to talk to each other as normal people have normal conversation\nI get frustrated I sit here and do the show there's so many times where I think that's a joke that I could make it'll it'll run through my mind as I can make that joke and Ninety nine percent of\nThe people listening a view the wonderful people listen to this show who do really mean so much to me every day Ninety nine percent of you will be like oh that's really funny or maybe maybe even you know Ninety percent of you would think it was funny nine percent of you would think man wasn't that great\nAnd then one percent though of the lives listening or one percent of the people that includes media matters and some of the other maniacs that listen to this show or they would have a problem with it and they would take it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just\nNot worth the risk and\nIt's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to\n... because comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push founded you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there and I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics and I do but it's I just know that you know you you run up against this\nAh this third rail that's a mobile third rail either they it's not like it stays in one place you don't know how close you are getting to it because they'll change the rules and they'll change what's going on around you based upon their ability to get you when they want when they want to get you it's just that so inspiring going back to the\nThe way that they're using these calls of racism and massaging these allegations as really a primary a primary means to get people to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can do\nYou know I I they're they're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist in terms of ... and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't forgotten\nThat\nBill Clinton hey ladies haven't seen a little while as wants to come over who wants to take a selfie with me\nJust watch word out of hand goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respecting Democrats circles in fact Hillary went out and said recently there was no power imbalance but the president of United States she sent us an interview\nWhat was it a week ago\nThere was no no no power imbalance between the ... the United states and ... injured in the White House that he was having a\nRelations relations with um she still she still will say stuff like that and of course she thinks she's still running for president which is\nAs you give us all a nightmare as how long but it really should be the stuff of of bad dreams but I think it it could become our reality before before too long\nThis is the thing that there's a there's a joy ... at the heart of of the Democrat\nPolitical ideology these days it's all about\nMaking sure that no one you know there used to be this all I forget who it is a who said it I Want to say it's men can but it might not be Jamaican but you know a appearance in is somebody who lives with a constant fear that someone somewhere might be having a good time\nAnd you find that increasingly tree of Democrats you know a a Democrat is somebody who's constantly and fear of someone somewhere saying anything interesting radical new different you know breaking down old paradigms\nAnd enjoying themselves while they do it you know enjoying themselves while they try to challenge the dominant political orthodoxy Democrats get terrified by that they show\nDesire conformity and discussions all the time in fact they desire telling you what word you can use in the discussion and and who can who can use what kinds of words\nSo many constraints put on this all always I mean I just it would be easy for me to switch you know in in my head if I wanted to and and become a Democrat just call everybody every conserve everyone the other side is racist all the time everything is sexism everything is intersection analogy\nIt's just exhausting though isn't it to think that way\nYou you think about what it really must be like to be some of these\nAre just joyous radical feminist that I've seen recently and had to talk to a few times\nIn the last few months because the whole cabinet situation who really do think of women as this terribly oppressed and marginalized minority in society you know they're actually in mind the majority by population\nBut they really think of themselves this way and there's a constant\nChip on the shoulder attitude for all their interactions with men always it's just not a good way to go through life it's just not a a\nHealthy way to be an increasingly I think for Democrats you know it's a it's like a sugar\nHigh politically you know oh you got to do all the virtues signaling and he's got to feel like you're so brave and tall on issues where you're taking what is the most convenient issue for you politically socially and professionally\nAs a Democrat um but at the end of days isn't it just doesn't feel\nKind of hallowed and never have to really engage the other side and just call them racist and\nMassage this I don't know I Hope people think about this as they go in and they vote or they think about whether they're going to vote or not [noise] definitely worth spending some time [noise]\nGot some of my hand right now [noise] ... life all coffee\nLike having a warm cup of freedom that keeps you energize and ready to fight

about a very high a very hot Senate race is very telling that's another way of saying yeah like isn't it crazy that like here we are having to be covering this thing that we've made the decision to cover so that tells you that like it clearly has to be covered\nRight exactly\nThey are manufacturing this whole story it's it's not I'm not saying there's nothing there but it's not nearly as interesting or as close to ... or anything else to their protest seven seven point deficit in the Senate race oh and it's only trying to protect grooves\nI've been saying that you know when my ten

have no idea none whatsoever or I shouldn't say they have no idea that's not true see\nThey want to tell people what they want to tell them\nAnd they've been pushing this this storyline ... all along a singer ... syndrome story about an hour or so they've been pushing this and now they're realizing that it's not actually going to be anything like what they had pretend that wasn't the same thing as I said with Jon Ossoff and with Wendy Davis and these other\nMedia darling candidate to get all this member media coverage is money folks this is one thing that you that we never really get to talk
