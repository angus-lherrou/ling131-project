punish to the fullest extent of the law or the breaking the case apparently was related to fingerprint\nEverything that we've been talking about this week is with the\nAh ways that DNA can be useful and and how the intact devices would provide a treasure trove of information for from a forensics perspective all that was accurate there's also some early reporting that the\nUsage of cell phones and cell phones ... might have been part of this as well especially once you figure it out where the drops were for this mail you could probably pull cell phones within a certain radius\nAnd this guy had his phone on him um then they have a way of narrow things down and he also is a\nCertainly not a criminal mastermind buddy career criminal with a wrap sheet of all I mean so much stuff that I Can't even think of it all on my head I mean it's got all kinds of\nA criminal activities background including a previous previous bomb threat um previous bomb threat I think for two thousand and two as\nWell as drugs stuff and stealing and he's he's got he's got a long long wrap sheet\nSo the threat based on everything we know it was completely gone there is nothing there's nothing to suggest that this guy had any one assisting him there's any cell or cluster hear anyone else that his operation on his behalf this was a lone crazy in a van\nThe van which you may very well have seen already\nA van is\nCovered in pro Trump and pro pens paraphernalia and CNN sucks and other anti a mainstream media stuff he clearly was very attuned to the rhetoric\nOf the right and particularly of Donald Trump himself\nIn a way that is being seized on\n'em now look what we we left open the possibility all week\nThat there would be a few different ways that this could go right that there would be a few different possibilities for motive here\nOr we discussed that it could be a crazy we discussed that it could be a yes it could have been a false flag operation but there was no evidence to support anything other than bombs are being sent it was a very dangerous situation than it needed to be\nA fixed dealt with as soon as possible what's also just take them home and just say the law enforcement did an incredible job here and they should be commended for working under tremendous pressure and doing show uh with the entire country watching in a\nVery much paying attention to every move here if I were a little more from attorney general sessions he actually read out the charges place well\nHe's been charged today with five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive ... you\nDon't need to hear sessions intersections read it out again a lot of charges he's facing life in prison is facing life in prison so uh that's this is really over with now there's not all that much to say nobody was even injured in this so thank God\nUm but this is now an entirely political discussion that's where this goes there's not a security and law enforcement\nWas on the ball got this guy tracked him down everything that we thought would happen with this happened this is really textbook from the investigative standpoint\nNow this is the food fight that we've all known was already happening but now it's going to get even worse about how this is Trump's all they want to say that this is Trump's fault doesn't matter that\nWe didn't blame the last we didn't blame Bernie Sanders himself for the James Hodgkinson shooting them at baseball diamond doesn't matter that\nEach a fallacy to assume that somebody who says something\nThat has not calling for inspiring

forced to take responsibility for actions that other people do not based on what we tell them to do but based on the fact that they have their own demons their own problems and they are crazy but be prepared\nFor an avalanche fear of media coverage and commentary particularly commentary\nAbout how Trump needs to change his town Trump has to stop calling the media fake news yet to stop he has to stop doing everything that that they don't like\nThis now is the secret weapon that they have to get Trump to shut up and I'm here to tell you that would be a huge mistake this is not Trump's fault it's just not your fault that is not my fault we take no responsibility for this\nBecause we bear no responsibility for this we\nShare ideas we fight for the truth and we will\nNot\nBe forced into a

know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this is why\nI I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we\nKnow that this guy is a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with his complete you know look he's he's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to do there need to be serious consequences for this well you're in a minute this guy is also I mean is it there's something sad about someone who\nShow show deranged empathetic and an evil and\nJust the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters were this guy is representative of a broader sense but on the right meanwhile you know\nWe have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his\nA wave uses his politics\nUm but now that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties I think it's like Nineteen Ninety three you'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that's\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show on rising morning with junk we're now we're going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always have to point out well the big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it ah that's\nFirst and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this\nWhat is the determining factor whether something is counter to terrorism because\nWith some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know a neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority they'll say it's terrorists now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nA little bit less obvious less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism uh and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nOr an from the statistics forwarded attacks in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks then you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat that we\nYou know you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them tell them I mean these are attacks would it kill hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most of the right when jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals'\nBy a neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous evil or\nCrimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not

our\nFellow says are uh say rock whatsoever keep forgetting is how to save his last name I mean everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying ah everyone saying that you know he's obviously so pro Trump Betty such a bad guy said or say ... say opposites Iraq say or\nWhat is a we know what is\nIt is not I mean is American but what what's his his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any news his first name it saves artist kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this is not going away anytime soon it's ah unfortunately going to be used against us and\nI don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it doesn't I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but ... you're going to see floods ... zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid week and change\nBecause they want this to be first and foremost on the\nMinds of as many voters as possible and and\nThey're going to be they're going to be really pushing this they really want people to think that this is\nThis is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when\nThere's going to be crazy people of all kinds from all places but\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count and more importantly\nThey've done something that makes it much harder to join they've stifle gross to a point where it is obvious to all a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship now it is a blimp total bias\nThat's from the leader of the free world my friends who has an enormous Twitter falling but he knows if something's up if you don't trust these social media giants to do right by you any more there are other places to go ... dot com is a new social media site\nThat has none of the biased none of the left leaning agenda nonsense that's going to be shadow banning people

one news radio five sixty telling you the\n\nOnly sound like Sarah Fox news or the FBI examining a van converting anti Democrat and pro Trump stickers belonging to mail bomb ... saves are than he was arrested this morning for the series and attempted bombing targeting high profile Democrats and other\nHe just has a certain you know a charismatic presentation and or a compelling personal story and all of a say a fancy degrees and other things but ultimately Obama thinks that society is broken up between those who have stuff\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have other in or outside of government in order to make sure that they keep the stuff that they have stuff and that other people don't ah that sounds very that has a Marxist twang right that sounds like it's\nVery much about the redistribution of wealth and\nI think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself\nHe's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful\nThat's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats and v envy push that pushed that notion it's which powerful politics and accused the other side of being cynical ... what is it that Republicans Republicans want to give a little less of their own money\nTo the government there being greedy ... this is a\nA at a central talking point on the left\nYou'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires okay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pace I think thirty percent of all federal income taxes so there we already have a very\nProgressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about you know ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to wherever it is wherever it is every speech he gave same basic theme there are the other guys\nDon't want the government to have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff\nHe creates this perception that prosperity and security and all these things that people strive for and society that that zero some\nOne side had at the other side doesn't mean what what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is you know why why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list and these are people that have amassed incredible fortunes\nAll Democrats ... why are they all Democrats you know what\nWhat I find to be the case that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle\nTo make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative people that when the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people\nOr people who get really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being like the tenth guy in the door and now there are options are worth a billion dollars and\nThey tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it\nIf you had to sweat it out rich many night's sleep a you know doing your own taxes take out your own trash\nA cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nAre concerns I just\nThat's the only way I can explain the difference in the economic philosophy here uh but Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful in the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen\nCrisis in our life [noise] and\n\nOh why did it start with Obama\nHow how about we've had even we had an even bigger\nFinancial pulled back with the great depression and we recovered from that and went and entered period of huge economic growth and boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years into the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow about ... reminder by the way Obama never achieved a three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never only president in history for whom that's the case\nSo when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous that what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government was the problem with what happened and the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this\nYou know when he says degree banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was that liberals said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories\nThen banks to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a long and you do that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street\nAnd Wall Street does what it does that's what really happened I mean you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy what exactly does does he think\nGot and it was a ... girl they caught him to go go go gotta going how what what exactly did he do\nAnd I think the truth is it's very clear he he has absolutely no answer that I mean the stimulus was was atrocious Simmons was a huge waste of money and that was money that was put on the tab for future generations to pay so what\nYou do ... what did Obama bring to the table when it came to get an economy of running answers he doesn't even have an answer he's just out there it's just all demagoguery it's all so shallow but really that's a good summary of what we had for eight years of Obama to all the

the purpose of that mission so that's I Know it's a broader philosophical point but I Do think we should keep that about but the new story that I mean the one that got me thinking about this because we don't talk that much of a radical Islam these days is that the European Court of human rights\nWhich look I Know this isn't about us this doesn't affect us but the European Court of human rights has said now\nThat free speech does not include ... the prophet of Islam that's right free speech is no longer inclusive of saying stuff about\nThe prophet Mohammed and others so have you get mad at me when I said the prophet Mohammed I'm not saying he's my profit but we need some way to designate who this guy is because\nYou may be a very aware of his back a lot of Mohammed running around\nI don't think it's up to just say Mohammed you know maybe you could figure it out of context but people say the prophet Mohammed because you know then we all know we're talking about but it's now a knock considered free speech to say anything mean about the prophet Mohammed and you know you can say oh buck but that Europe\nWhy does that really matter keep in mind that one of the big arguments that we constantly hear now in this country is that what they're\nDoing in Europe we should replicate here when it comes to economics when it comes specifically to health care oh it works in Europe we should do it here Canada has also gone down this path\nCanada's no longer a country where you can a reliably speak on issues that deal with Islam and radical Islam ... radicalism and they also have a ... never mind also the gender male female issue\nWhich is we're really large professor Peterson's career by the way that he was one who said I like I'm not going to play this game of calling people need as a function of law that just strikes me as\nAs as bizarre and and he was right it was bizarre but here you have\nThe European Court of human rights by the way this is the\nUm this is the case that got this um uh\nSome attention quote the European Court of human rights rule Austrian courts had carefully balance or or the writer freedom of an Austrian woman who called Mohammadi pedophile due to his marriage to a six year old girl\nOr the woman in her late forties and identified only as E S claim during two public Santa more seminars in two thousand other moments marriage to a young girl was quote I can do pedophilia according to Islamic tradition the marriage between Mohammed and a six year old girl was\nConstantly when she was nine and he was about fifty\nShow here we have a faith tradition that his practice by one point seven billion people and the founder of this face a profit who\nFor believers and I'm not one so I Do not believe this obviously but for believers are was dictated by the angel Gabriel a a a a new holy book that really is meant to overtake all the previous holy books um but it's also accepted\nThat he had a a a relationship a sexual relationship ... when he was fifty when he was a middle aged man with a child\nThat that's just I mean that's just the state of the facts and this woman was convicted for saying this she was convicted of disparaging\nReligious doctrines had to pay five hundred and forty seven dollar fine so this has now been upheld or the European Court of human rights says that this is the serves the legitimate aim of quote preserving religious\nPiece let me have a few words to say about this um okay if we see this ground\nThat we are no longer allowed to say things that are offensive to people especially offensive to people who are special protected class because of their religion their skin color of their ethnicity their nationality if we see that ground or we will increasingly find that that is just

back when you know because when it comes to the fight for self taught never saw [noise]\nI got to\nSay I thought this was a fantastic story\nIn that it lets me do one of my favorite things which is\nBeat up on millennials which ever in the media does including people like me who are technically millennials are you know this is where you make the pack need avocado toast joke a this is where you get to talk about safe spaces and pajama boy at all that stuff\nOr this was in a this was in the daily\nWire was earlier this\nWeek that there is is it is a study from San Francisco State University that claims at twenty five percent\nAnd ... are suffering from get ready for it\nKeep GST now\nPie DSD is incredibly serious obviously the DSD is something that if you have for real reasons as a deserving of the most serious treatment and and assistance and helping and sympathy\nBut they've got beat DSD because of the election that's right they are so psychologically traumatized because Trump won the twenty sixteen election that they are now considering themselves to be\nOfficially a officially suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome to a clinically significant level\nA clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say goes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up and maybe we'll have to do a book or a project on this about how the left\nReally has lost its mind I don't mean that as in oh I'm I'm trying to be funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual thing that people do on radio or uh in in political media which is you know you exaggerate to get attention nor do I I mean that\nThere are a lot of people on the left who have had a real clinically I'm a possible to evaluate nervous breakdown that they have lost it I mean they have lost it in a profound way a and\nThis is this is telling us that that's exactly what happened you know I always try to tell folks ...\n... you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my liberal friends is when I when they asked me they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all all bummed out about all this stuff really just\nYou know Trump is destroying America they they cry about it and they get really upset or or they don't well hope you don't actually cry but they they want about it I Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to you as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions it's not going to affect your job is not gonna affect your home it doesn't affect\nAnything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that there is a a big part of the general population that likes the anxiety of catastrophe that they like to cling to this notion\nThat oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying there aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have you know first and foremost among them is you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about 'em you know we we are probably going to explode our currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always leading to financial disaster there was no it has never been avoided the currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent\nA track record of this so you know that's a real concern a disease that is in ... because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria and uh you know a mass infection or ... mass\nViral plague things like that that's real concern and day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing at work but the concerns that liberals obsess over or\nDelusions or this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean that quite literally the entire planet will die unless we start making insignificant modifications do our day to day lives\nWith regard to seal to admissions that's crazy that it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about that's not a normal thing to think that just bonkers\nAnd when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that uh they they are worried about things that for the sake of worrying in many cases but the problem is they believe that they don't know that they're doing that always speaking of a of of uh\nYou know very real pie TST ah I saw you know in in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an excellent show 'em and they really make use of the backdrop of the first World War\nThese you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least and for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up realizing that you don't really want to eat\nCandy all the time you know you don't really want to be in a position where you're just\nConstantly ... on races pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces you will find yourself at some point to have eaten all the ... you know and then as the most the most popular candy in the world\nThat's where I Am an ... number one\nIt was a random aside I almost\nA started working when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a I forget which I don't remember what it's called out but if some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy and I'm pretty sure was the Mars account which is a ... so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take I mean thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you need all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reached this level where you're like I've I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore and uh so you learn that as a kid in it but then as an adult as a guy you know you you get to\nBe a rather than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a um\nI dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one or whatever that's that's cool\nBut some college age and and ... and older young women tend to dress in more provocative fashion so Gonzaga is worried about this and also is a reminder for me that cultural appropriation\nWhich has gotten all this attention right now over the over the holiday season cultural appropriation is not a thing\nOr it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to anyone or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are done a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution and the only way that culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural odds most is\nLike that pulled out of fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my best and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume that you're either very embarrassed about her very proud of\nDon't be show I don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I oh I\nSee how it is I see how you're calling me out and see what's out there is producer Mike is he going is he talking to a naughty nurse right now or is she within earshot of the microphone\nI think he's talking to a naughty secretary over somewhere that that sounds that\nSounds about right or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike He is he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I can tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC I found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween\nParty and I I theater supply store and they let me rents because you want to get really high end costume and I've spent a lot of money got a rent it and I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of uniform replica\nOf general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe\nAnd the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way tend to lose be surprised how much attention to the ladies give to a guy walks around wearing\nWearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with the kind of a you know the\nSeventies style tennis outfit because I just basically shrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band than an hour wouldn't tennis rackets that worked out so I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who is is quite as up on on the costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend\nAppropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it this is America a but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpiked a candy corn pumpkin juice do ... candy corn roster cheat as your duty you know this type of thing like you know they might finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember I was never a huge Halloween guy\nHe loved it but I was an adult I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friend did a group thing and we did the ah Addams family and uh I was a go mess Adams\nI'm and that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individual people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and the but then when he got altogether it was like oh you guys are often so that was a sort of our writers today Halloween parties that ... I I Know I'm more\nFair enough you know and I will eat the candy and I will give out the candy but uh what is the best Halloween candy [noise] good question I mean I I'm a\nI have a huge sweet too so I don't ... pieces for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think Greece's pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular I'm considered\nI mean we actually got in this conversation the other day I'm ... I'd like to freeze some of my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nI I had enough over that I Do know that a ... chip for all those listening if you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave the you'd do maintain freshness\nBaked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah I didn't learn until like a couple of years ago is apparently they didn't\nDidn't teach us that the CIA school [laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer my concerns were to come back we've got a buddy\nBenny Johnston in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHam all kind of like a double dose of the Daily Caller was brought in the show\nAnd you know before I actually did a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the podcast today with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that I oh by the way it will be on ... and Bream show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth but while so [noise]\nAnd uh I'll be back and just [noise] the\nFBI calls home titles that's one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourself if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for what a feat steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\nPunch American homeowners because we have equity in our homes and the bad guys are stealing it they take you off your homes title an add an alias than they borrow hundreds of thousands using your homes equity and stick you with the payments you won't know until you get a late payment notice\nIdentity theft programs and insurance policies don't protect you\nHome title walk safeguards your homes title from cyber thieves and hackers by putting an online perimeter around your homes title\nThe instant they detect someone tampering with their own it to shut it down for pennies today home town of luck protects my most valuable asset my family's home you needed to register for a free now says you have your homes title has been compromise that's a hundred dollar value free visit home titled rock dot com\n[noise] don't miss your chance to win\nThe doubled you Leo seat and all states seamless gutters one hundred thousand dollar ball home make over one hundred grand to spend on your home however you want Internet outlet W.
