six [noise]\nAnd party divided I least till the camera Fox News at least on one issue as President Trump moved dwindle policy that grant citizenship to children born in the west whose parents are here illegally in an\nThis will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons\nThat's right not foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut\nIt is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and they were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there have been all stories on that so we're in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in a a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is\nThat the they're when they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to the mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be\nA commodity that people can just sort of snatch for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it\nThan that and we obviously can\nTell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut oh but it's a citizen right oh but this person's a citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws\nAnd then they benefit from that violation of law and they ... or a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure overrides\nAn actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nGovernment is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interest of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what\nAs I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist and then you keep working back from this and you'll find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat two Democrats really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment\nSays and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely that\nLater on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you were waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration ... chain migration to bring interest the family in the oil and it was at one kid in America I Know you're already at the front of the line\nWhen it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know that the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth one in five and twenty fourteen seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to an immigrant's whether legal or illegal\nAnd illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams believe that three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states but it's not just a three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now\nIt's a three hundred thousand plus then they'll likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here illegally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child\nYou know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families so forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\nBaby right it it just actually gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is a illegal right\nAcross the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe that but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigrations and Customs Enforcement later tries to deport the\nParents they're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not from a perspective of separation of powers the constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a\nWho's a citizen subject the jurisdiction there of and\nThere were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction\nUm but the courts have never really weighed in on this in a clear fashion so yes Trump's executive order on this show to get science should he do it will clearly be challenge right away by the never Trump judiciary\nAnd quite honestly it'd probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did this it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue\nBut it will get fast tracked I think to the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out if in fact the Supreme Court\nWants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through continued loopholes in the immigration system because it benefits Democrats that's we're\nGoing to find out and by the way at the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or rather if you're born in this country you are no longer going to be an automatic citizen what does that say about the scam the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time\nWhat does that say about what's been going on if ... if that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and out of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution so we really so the American people really would have been scammed all this time oh it when you look at this we are the outlier\nThere are roughly thirty countries in the world where if you're born in them you get citizenship automatically the only ones that are that are developed world or the\nYep yup yeah that just wait you know he's going to turn on us and we're going to go oh gosh now I think he's really just more said he's out of it now Mike what's what's the real deal year he's he's saying he's ... he's been used so clearly there's a little bit negative situation there already distancing himself from politics right that's right that's what he's saying\nSo it's not like I hate Donald Trump but you know remember this was a guy that's at George Bush hates black so you know he has had some inflammatory stuff in the past\nAnd get your opinion on what do you think he's a new operating by the Trump handbook of creating chaos to you know create a bigger name for himself and fell more ... gay apparel and your music\nOh after a dude absolutely and I know I Know you think that yes of course of course ... is all about marketing I mean it is music is is kind of\nIt's catchy but I don't think anyone sits around like wow Conyers changed you know change what it is to listen to like contemporary hip hop or anything\nUh I I think that he's very good at getting attention and marketing and in the current environment whether it's politics or you know mass media and entertainment that's like Ninety percent of the game you know you have to have a product that's okay but you can take a very mediocre product and sell the bejesus out of it\nUm by getting a lot of attention for it you know ... and and getting a lot of people to sit around and talk about it in and get free marketing I mean look ... visit to the White House Mike and we're trying to put a dollar figure on that what do we think that's worth than there was a marketing I mean clearly it's worth\nI Would argue it's worth tens of millions of dollars a free a free publicity absolutely like if if you were to pay a publicity for him to get you that level of attention in the national news media ... you're looking at at eight figure media by yeah I mean it would have to be enormous and all he had to do is be like yeah I like Trump and ... and all this yet but\nAnd actually you know he's in the oval office yeah next you know you know office right and you know I I think\nA lot of ... I mean look I Know I expected a lot of us did but the good news is I wasn't sitting around with\nConyers changing the conversation like no you're not changing the conversation I mean he's changing the conversations that it's about\n... but that's not something that I think we all need to sit around and celebrate I mean a good good for him\nA but I I never thought that he was a ... a reliable ally for conservatism so this is not this does not surprise me I I Do I look I if I went back and was the shows I Know that said I don't think everyone needs to bash the guy should be allowed to you know should be allowed to approach trumpet say these things I don't think he's that crazy and they did get some\nUh they did get some\nPeople out of prison and you know there there were some good stuff that was done here I can I can say that the conversation I think the conversation from pat with county it was interesting just won a spectacle but two there were some points made that were worthwhile\nBut you know look this is why conservatives and we we always seem to remember this we have her role with ideas and ideals we do not really have heroes [noise] [noise]\n... years ago making a murderer became less a TV show of\nForce of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of re budding Myrtle\nMounting a murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the up and have a\nHello this is Keith ... was shaping furniture shortly after Jennifer and I got married I was introduced to one of her family's annual traditions Thanksgiving at grandpa Nixon's house in the north Carolina mountains tell him about it ...\nWell ... all the cousins aunts and uncles I gather there and leave the advice or we lays mountains play into enjoy each other's company\nThe guy's ... pet outside and as we got a new around the table they got a highlight of the week in was hearing back this plant on that huge pay to start the meal\nThose are great memories what were your traditions look like this year maybe this is the year you finally get that dining table that everyone can sit around whether your family as big or small we've got great news for Saturday November third are dining furniture is on sale\nShape and financial dying fail and it's going on now take twenty six exit Ninety One in shape and and not for the big bag chair\nOften ... don't waste register online and only\nTime I got my cannon fodder for less than four five seven seven seven fat or protecting license\nAt nova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author Fulbright Scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] they'll teach adults don't you start up there for patients foil a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with an education [noise] bucks back then is that [noise]\nMore people see Democrats inaction\nBefore this uh mid term coming up in a week the better by the way you can you keep having these little moments that pop up or you go oh wow okay so that Democrat who is positioning himself or herself as you know somewhat of a moderate on some of these issues and a person who work with the other side may be you\nKnow very very I anti Trump obviously almost all the Democrats have to take this very anti Trump position but yeah there's some people that are at least making a you know going through the motions of\nBeing not completely insane leftist but then you see what ends up happening or you see what happens with the candidate you see what happens with the supporters uh you know ... Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who\nI I don't know how you can think he's a good idea of the state of Florida I mean I we've played it on this show and the Florida election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor\nBut Gillum is a guy who a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nAround this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up the the future or for the Democrat Party\nAnd you know there's going to give them though we've we've talked or we've talked about before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve\nHealth care but really when it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really ... they're gonna raise taxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised\nTaxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid health\nOutcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools you can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot more ... a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart you actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system\nWhich you see is that the money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers it's going to these bureaucrats administrators the teaching system what\nDo you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean do image to a bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of it's kind of a nasty guy um\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say that was like oh they ... they'll they'll they'll be paying taxes to really\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more in government benefits and they pay in taxes but even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off as a country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided\nOkay how is it supposed to make us less divided to bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay who do not speak the language who do not share our culture and whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat is going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that are up to this point or most of us have been on aware of that that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping it up oh Schmidt by the way\nIs not is not done with the big fat joke stupid thing that each day very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway despicable early today goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious out of it no man\nThe propaganda industry that she commands with a vile president that she serves about it by mark ... van and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart\nNews pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight mess that they have made that have triggered and radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ...\nHe said do lead writer and a lot of guys aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign at any level tells you really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was doomed he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin as the VP was the great I'd a great idea writer who is part of that whole process\nSo but he but to the to the main point here\nClaiming that Breitbart and ... a rash and a little van and others have blood on their hands is just is just a a a smear\nEach just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after an anti after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue these complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after ...\nWow I mean it showed brazen\nThat there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical but he doesn't care\nAnd that MSNBC put this on the air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments either right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation after they got this\nGuy the guy got blood on time for the thing about the same to stage but with the now with the who\nWhat Martin woman doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know it's just it's just an outrage somebody would set of em are at war or about Russia or any of total outrage\nBy MSNBC is maybe that's why I don't spend as much time on it because MSNBC is almost in terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of left is it's really beneath contempt uh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe\nThat history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math is not an essential elements of good policy making ... ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC\nAnd that everybody should climate there were a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that that's a recipe for a healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers\nMind man it is it has been rough watching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just outrageous stuff and then turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things oh wait\nWait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV let's just throw in one one more one more out there who is a quote conservative\nOr you know who's coming the laughs favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly on the right Jennifer Rubin who ... you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things that I have a red in in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer and I I Wish we saw and heard more from Charles these days I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but I've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented\nA but Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes one year and then writes the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nIt's like this is a really good idea for Israel that's just terrible for Israel you know this is a really good thing for conservatives it's time for conservatives\nAre there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough sees an opening to trash Trump brand new Semitism she's taken to play Fifteen\nThat's not the way his press had long hair kind that's not ...\nIs that people respond to ... I think he got out there talking about his tax plan it's not out there talking about these great trade deal he got out on the cake else out\nThere and waiting the bloody shirt and that's what he does or\nIt's ... I I ... I don't want\nYou to get frustrated because she used to do it too stupid now we can't we're we're ... I'm shutting down for for now because it is too dumb to err on the show that's what I'm going to be an aunt that I've heard it on the show ... were were were banning I think Reuben is the outer limit producer Mike of what we could put all the air here\nI tried to ban most MSNBC stuff but you know you know but sometimes I Want to book slap it so you know and I know you do that right but I but I feel that this drug sometimes when you buck slap and you feel dirty afterwards because you're like oh I actually\nTouch it you know gross MSNBC gross\nA meal my um yeah sometimes it goes slap MSNBC around a little bit uh or we got we got a big second hour of the show come up so let let's get right to that and uh we will talk about the election in the mid term a few days away an oath so much more also represents record will be joining and buddy Johnson cigarettes\nEverything you do online is fresh there's tremendous amount of information that people can get from whatever it is you're doing on your computer or your tablet\nOr your smartphone and once the bad guys get their hands on that oh man you're in a world of hurt I Know about protecting your information and do it off and that's why I use express [noise]\n... a bushel private network but that means is that you just use it for the and I don't have to worry about people\nGetting all your private information and showing you the\nRest of the pie and protects you run he was in the background or by computer prone and tablet cost less than seven dollars a month to have you ever used public walk by and want to keep hackers\nInspires from senior ... expression solution projector online activity today and find out how you can get three months breed breast being dot com slash book that expressed VPN dot coms watch book\nFor three months breed of a one year [noise]\nRight now is your chance to make a difference you know people don't have\nThe opportunity for America and its kids\nAnd take an active state in the future of the country\nReturn on investment in mind when you get back is knowing you protected are potentially the one day and you can grow up to become the region and argued and they get in an ... she's a teacher ...\n... ... my name is Lisa and I'm David in\nBefore you get caught up in I think your ears into some clarity Marta ... one news radio five sixty jumbled you\n\n... Fox News President Trump against entering ending the policy where children born in the west to parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically us citizens Democrats slamming the plant\nDemocrats accused the president of manufacturing an issue in the final hours to deflect promote voters really care about health care\nWell you're not going to bring the temperature of the rhetoric down you're not going to lessen the outrage in our discourse by just being more angry more destructive and more hateful than ever that that that's pretty self evident\nMedia has figured that out they were on the one hand say Trump needs to stop being so political in his speech and then the other said Trump is Trump has blood on his hands and these are media organizations you don't even pundits relieves their whole whole new up and they'll say Trump has blood on his hands because of this or that terrible thing\nBut it gets even worse um I I saw this yesterday and I rarely do I have to do I have a wild moment watching CNN or MSNBC these is rarely made it happens but I'm sure we used to them\nSmearing the president so used to just ... everything gets raises everything is white nationalist average you know this is ... and ...\nAt a certain level it's also just so boring and repetitive\nYou know they're not even creative anymore and the way that they hate the president and it's just\nThey're all repeating each other and then they're all just trying to outdo each other with the the worst and nasty stuff they can think of to say and this has become a this to become its own little industry who can think of the most outrageously anti Trump thing to say on national TV\nBut I think ... I think we've got a winner\nIn Julie or your ... or ...\nWho I did not know this uh had been fired from Politico for a tweet suggesting that the president commits incest and she's very coarse language not just as the thoughts disgusting but the president commits incest with his own daughter\nThat's that's true political ad on staff yeah\nShe got fired because I guess even for the live media there are some limits to how protest they can be and still be quote unquote journalists\nBut Jake Tapper owes so famous fake tapper oh show serious tapper who just can't stop chin wagging about how he's the most uh you know down the middle you know Ernest\nGums shoe journalist ever known oh and oh by the way you know how much you love charity and the troops let them tell you a hundred times a day it would just you know enough Jake we we get it\nOr you know this is a guy though who is ... Ito will get very gets very aggressive with conservatives on a regular basis gets very aggressive with people around the president calls amount called them for being liars and all this he has ... on a show and does not stop her\nOr challenged her at all when she says the following yesterday play quip one\nYou know that's pack and at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on it talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and\nThis president has radicalized sell many more people than I separate dad I mean the way he talks the way the way that is that's just it it it's a hot at the way the way I see a allows the way he was ... ...\nYeah that's right presidents radicalized more people than ISIS now now I I Know that there's there's some people who might say hold on a second book you know if you're if you think that being a conservative as radical and they tried to rationalize this in some way but none of what she just did there\nWas to compare the president and therefore his supporters who she says have been radicalized because\nSo far there's only been one radical that we know of who's actually been violent who's a Trump supporter one out of sixty three million that voted for Trump never mind those who didn't vote for him I think he's great it was a lot of those do\nYou got one that we know of we don't have people run around in the streets like we do with it\nIn the fall in large numbers causing mayhem and the name of Trump you know that's all on the left we don't have anybody who's actually\nHarmed and come very close to assassinated in a a a member of the opposing party as we do with these deep Scully shooter and the Don lemon treated out today that he can't even imagine a Democrat being violence\nThese college retreated that just with these eyes looking up at the sky like are you kidding me Don Lemon multimillionaire newsman image also the Trump is right he's just not on let me just not very smart and he's very insecure about that because he's just not it's not very smart\nBut\nYou know you look at the way that this conversation happens and and and the way that the left tries to frame it\nAnd you know you off a decides that ... whatever she decided that the way to get attention here and she succeeded in that regard it should just go even crazier than everybody else\nThe Islamic state ran a totalitarian caliphate for a few years that enslaved millions of people that engaged in massive kidnapping torture and rape operations as a function of of war and policy like they did that systematically\nA murder or at least\nTens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people if you were to really kind of a mass graves horrific televised torture executions\nAnd she thinks that she thinks that it's in any way rational and reasonable to compare Trump and his radicalized supporters to the Islamic state in in any context\nNow the only defense that I can come up with for free yeah your coffee here and she's indefensible but I mean the only way that you could really try to explain this as well there are so many people on the left that casually compared Trump to Hitler at this point casually compare Trump to you know the third Reich\nAnd uh and and and say that there's all this this rise of white nationalism and not season that's occurred under Trump none of it you know I remember when Brock Obama was president and there were all these all these stories from the uh you know the Southern Poverty Law Center in these other groups all there's this terrible rise of white nationalist groups because of Obama\nAnd nothing happened for eight years in the white nationalist there's like fifty losers no one pays attention to really or just pathetic and want it and want attention you know the white nationalist are really the equivalent of like the Westboro Baptist church but the media makes it out to be oh\nThis scourge they're coming for us that are going to take over everything and they're just delusional ... well it's not even that the delusional they're they're really cynical because this serves their interest their interest is to make the white nationalist seeing what they are much bigger than they are much more\nYou know the Nineteen sixties the Nineteen seventies when there were only a handful of channels in the broadcast news networks were the only news and whatever they decided was was what people thought reality was\nUm but this idea that that Silicon Valley or it has has these people who remember Google's model used to be don't be evil which is I've always thought\nI always thought that was very telling because if that has to be your motto there's something there's something going on but when I when I look at this this current trend and obviously we have a a great sponsor on the show that started a new\nSocial media platform that that explicitly says we are not engaging the left wing censorship people understand that you know if you can get together with you know fifty a hundred thousand you know other conservatives in one place and share ideas is that may be much\nMore fruitful place to go and share ideas than to be in this massive multi billion person ecosystem where you don't really know what you're getting and where it's coming from and who's in charge of determining what you see which may be dot\nCom by the ways that site that's the that's the uh the platform that sponsor here on the show and they're they're a new social media network but the need for this is very ... and ... vt age when he says that we shouldn't in trust\nSilicon Valley with this stuff ah he's completely right I mean there's ... there's just no way this ends in anything other than conservatives that massive disadvantage as well or you know Trump's twenty twenty campaign manager\nA heat earlier today Brad par scholar who looks\nLike a a a Brooklyn barber slash arches cocktail maker or you know he talked about the Palo Alto mafia and the censorship of conservatives you're talking to this on on CBS this morning these are real things that are happening and\nIt ... it reminds me of how at a place like CBS or NBC back in the day they didn't think they were biased and that was the really the the main underlined pointed Bernie Goldberg would work at CBS for a long time then became more of a Fox News stable and a conservative\nBut you know ... ... the part of this the liberals didn't understand was that they thought that they were being objective they were so biased as to be in capable of understanding and accepting the degree of biased in their journalism which is a whole level right it's it's one it's all level beyond\nIt's one thing just say I know that I'm actively pushing for one side or the other and I'm making a conscious decision\nAge even more pernicious\nWhen you push for one side and the debate over the other and you don't even realize you're doing it\nAgain you know I'm just I'm just just the facts you know this is this is Apple's not bananas there was a bananas not apples whatever it is over it and CNN so I I I Do think this is a\nThe finally this is the time when we understand that we're going to have to find workarounds or at least have a greater understanding of what's going on at these places and greater transparency because think about it this way if\nIf a small I ate really infinitesimal amount of money spent on Facebook ads by ... by some Russian\nA troll farmers if that can be thought to sway an election what do you think Google and Facebook can do and by the way do entirely legally that's much better than in many ways in in time contribution to one side of the other\nThe answer is they can sway an election [noise]\nThis is all I should Kaufman Clinton and it is my favorite

not doing\nAs right it's not brag and he's just telling it like it is ... all over the place how's it looking for the midterms is the Trump effect is going to carry the day is the cabinet wave still assessing\nAnswering these questions and more we have with us now Betty Johnson reporter at the Daily Caller Mr Johnson good to have you back\nPay but thank you so much for having me out\nSo do you think that they're going to be a lot of lives eating Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream are on election night in order to to do all the hurt and and deal with all the tears or they go in the house or how we look in right now\nYes Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream actually comes with a warning label on the back that says it does taste better if you're crying liberal tears enjoy it\nAnd you mix it up and the extra salty any extra sweet it goes together beautifully that's good and I think they're going to be a lot of that election night but there are trending polls awkward\nFor Republicans nationwide you have a lot of races\nAre particularly after the calving off the Kavanaugh fact you mentioned earlier\nA lot of races that work toss up\nWinning right a lot of races that worse steady down it's going to cost up a lot of races that Republicans seem to get married and Democrats seem to be able to cling onto his seat that have now ... um massively\nIn that direction of the pie as we were a lecture babies to pour tightening you extra races like Tennessee races I'm like a history but it really is trending upward for the ...\nDo you think that a Ted Cruz is gonna from an electoral perspective kicked a skateboard out from under ... and tell them the Sylvie heavy stuff is loud\n[laughter]\nThey're actually viral clip from Ted Cruz yesterday the republic on the Daily Caller a where he where he colder where he told a a a reporter who asked him about Texas getting their first Latino senator ah what is there a shortage is there a shortage of Irish men and the U.S Senate\nBecause of courses are actually Robert Francis over ... years very very Irish and Ted Cruz's with\nQueen ... and married to a billionaire by the way how does that not really ever get reported until now I've been reading about this guy for months I just found out that he's married to a billionaire family and tends to what his own financial interests are at stake side with the plutocrats over the people but he was shocked about ... Cho\nBark what a shock I mean what else are you going to say oh you're very come up and it's just terrible how could but the millionaires and billionaires on his campaign ... return to\nI didn't know if you count like count Dracula thing there that was burning at first I'm Glad we figured out it was it was burning but I Do feel like\nI Do feel like Bernie or rather ... ah got got kind of a pass for being incredibly wealthy\nAnd so every time I see this guy he's got the rolled up sleeves and he's been described as Kennedy asking I'm like oh so he's a silver spoon her who's running around with a nickname for a culture that is not his own okay that's interesting\n[noise] yeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them\nAnd then he could still we've seen on a skateboard my friend don't think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but in the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to ... always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWhere where you're expecting Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for you here ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who if you get W by their names are going to say it's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta and what that is is just\nPosition recorded twenty that was the candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the beta walk but he actually won ... shout out to the journal is right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas\nOr this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is monster campaigner and there's really actually\nMoving the needle her a lot of close races the president's going to do a ten day I attend a campaign stop ... or the next seven days up to election day uh he's throwing these trying something I I kind of on the campaign trail with his tail gates are so many people showed up for the Texas rally\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and and this is waiting to violence threats\nI got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience daily say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pay for rent or buy a climate that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite racist things obviously demagogue condos anytime 'cause I'm a stokes of national it said this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and\nWhat they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to\nChange any of our tactics do not try to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to want to get this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know state paid for health care and state paid for college which means you pay for worst question of how much it who\nAnd then let the may ... of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but did you you're not even hearing the make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating\nEither a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election war they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans and they're so terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case because there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many from listening to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically an editor already occurred on election day right so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter what no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really\nA function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away from finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years and it's not the most important election of our lifetime that that's not true okay that'd be ... and it's not what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet\nSo twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this mid term shakes out and and that's why I just think it's so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues yes like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow was Joe mansion even a Democrat because he likes unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist than they will vote to centrally fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that's the more common tactic that's much more likely to be or what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about\nHow protecting a protecting\nPreexisting conditions in Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from a left his trumpet Trump is a racist he's terrible and you know they're just they're never going to stop so that's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump's and you'll like him\nThis is nonsense this away from every time I mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime or I like what Trump is to say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that\nSo far I like 'em all\nI don't see anybody not and should they shut down and\nI like to I'd be very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody\nRight now that Trump looks at across the island things\nOh wow I don't know if I can hand I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThis is nobody there's nobody that's even close\nI the only one who you think maybe it's enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the west they're going to like him so that's a pretty big vulnerability\nThat you know yeah if you ... do you talk to me the ... but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of

Fox News President Trump considering doing away with birthright which automatically get citizenship to children born in the west even if the parents came here illegally white\nHouse is zeroing in on the five words subject to the jurisdiction thereof\n... it it's really that these are\nSimilar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained\nIllegally and being made illegally\nSo ... is is that an accurate reader or what's going on here I mean is it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people on the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer as if from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a dental\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with but with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction rates\nStarted skyrocketing but what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own 'til their own pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\nThey said look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an annex it looks like his antics that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real ... it's not a real Percocet it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking those for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it and two lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure buck you you hear about this all the time but that in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose in die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example\nIn April this year in Nebraska on state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds is that in all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people\nWhen we showcased are ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcased in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcase that they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now\nAnd they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction\nThis is about saving our children's lives realizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids we have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen before we lose a generation of our kids\nAnd we have to face it and we have to be honest about it\nServed this this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people would have been affected by this in any respect it's very it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in an all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing those right away so we can save lives\nAnd as people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriated the right way so that when the federal government puts money\nAside for this epidemic that\nThere's accountability for it that this one\nIsn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bat array of our\nOf our money pet but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that at this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane\nB. E. I. N. now I didn't gain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and do their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's game and we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua's Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way\nWhether that putting up the wall building the wall\nOr enforcing laws on international live and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you about how many parents I Know\nThat have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that the pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing step\nThat the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions a that ... what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home\nBut it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nIs when there's something get treated as a joke versus when is it treated seriously and and when assuming given the benefit of the doubt\nBy the media you know the narrative the conversation that people have based on what they're reading what they're being told what they're hearing when's that benefited out given to somebody versus when are they to be made an example of which is the the obviously the opposite of the opposite effect of all that and the truth\nIs it's a it's still very much the case that lives pretty much across the board\nGet the benefit of the doubt and then some and conservatives just get crushed and I find that frustrating and this this reminds me of a Lindsey Graham is saying look the only way to get lifted\nChange is to\nDrive them from their villages and here the limitations of their women so to speak ah\nHere's what he here's what Lindsey says about this like looked at\nThe American people have had it with this I've\nHad it with it Kavanaugh the caravan blaming Trump for everything under the side if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're gonna changes for them to lose if you want cabin on the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh carrier assassinations uh then you need to reject what they did and hand them to the state\nThey deserved they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the all the way they'll get it as for the American thankful to send out loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their attack they blaming every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement it really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I noticed that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle manly it just got the left who say oh great we're winning screw the other guys Trump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect it's not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've got to win\nLindsey Graham is saying that too and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh is correct [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThree years ago making a murderer became led to the TV show of\nForce of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dance on it and I would know I'm ... and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now on the ...
