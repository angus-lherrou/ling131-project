Sorry oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you all good a\nWhile for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could it be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen\nAnd Tom Petty where they were pounding the wardrobe you recall that not really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at ya but they're the same they recover from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war a it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken I'm Serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities gonna play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show a from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about\nWhen a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right well the first thing is you got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population\nThat is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen made that kinda thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] game they

it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know are almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really ... you got some work to New Jersey oh let's

issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks what what message is he going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would show dramatically changed their minds that would\nAll of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing is going what are we really going to do\nIt's just not a U.S citizen this was not doing on us soil the Saudis let's write this

new\nWhy use this our problem I keep hearing about what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do\nWhat could he do and why is it on him\nShouldn't as we don't we have a United Nations for exactly this purpose don't we have this international\nCommunity that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted action you saw a book but they won't do anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day\nBut when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it comes from from all nations United together well what about this issue well no that's not wait for the United community of nations to come together let let's have the u._s.\nDo what I have to say ... the the frenzy the frenzy to the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story\nOf the country and just skip over what's\nGoing on with us troops for example in Afghanistan of place we're still at which we are still in war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore or\nThey want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because\nThey do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them it's not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalists and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy tapper would say you know\nA damn ideas saying that that you are really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nA new tough talk tough talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined not a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first amendment though right not not much of that you hear that about Trump all the time because he\nTweets because he tweets this\nUh this journalist Chris Yogi what happened to them we still don't really know\nAnd we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts or this case they're still trying to figure it out but everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states leader the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that\nWhat they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or disgrace none other than\nShe's national security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes change this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fall play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is sending is that there is no consequences and what you have to realize that there's nobody else who can play the role of the United states to hold people like this to a ...\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not ... if we're not standing up for this there's not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are journalists everywhere are less safe and and let's face it we have a friend and I think there's a there are also they may say so for a values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nThat's a line that I think it's getting much worse\nThat is a giant pile of crap a giant pile of crap from Obama's chief national security propagandist a guy who laughed about creating an echo chamber of idiot\nAlmost entirely Democrat journalist during the Obama years to sell the Iran deal lasted they're ignorance in their stupidity at least on that he was right they do have a lot of idiot journalist that these media outlets especially the young ones were right out of college who have just bought into this left this nonsense hook\nLine and sinker but notice how far this goes in and this is trumped arrangements syndrome on the world stage\nAte a Saudi hit team kills a Saudi journalist in a consulate in Turkey and it's\nOn it's on Trump to make this right it's on us to make this right let me tell you something as someone who has spent more time than he ever thought he would\nIn war zones alongside men and women who were wearing the uniform to defend his country and you essentially rebuild other people's countries for them I don't think we have to make everyone else's problems are problems all the time\nYou know Saudi Arabia is a terrible tyrannical kingdom that we have to deal with because of the realities of the world we live in it's a terrible place by the way in large part because of the prevailing ideology which is fundamentalist Islam that's why it's so bad and repressive and intolerant\nOn human right worldwide well that began with Charlotte I remember vividly at ... up on the ballot when I talked to a group for an hour is on the international grip to protect journalists who told me it was within months of Trump taking office that they

eight Eighteen twenty six years for almost Thirty years how many people have been killed in this country we're journalists\nAnd he wanted to guess three\nThree people have been killed for journalism in America in Thirty years and not by the state but just by people that didn't like that the journalists were doing stories on them and when you look at the numbers abroad I'm not saying there aren't bad states and there aren't a child during regimes but they've been bad\nAll along they've been battle my\nWife comparison we've had three journalists killed in twenty six years in this country you

out I could say that I I he just misspoke a you know he he didn't mean he just met her Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians I've had many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nAh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole the Asperger a running joke anyway I Love the other stuff you say though that I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey\nGraham is oh he he's very much a\nVery much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger\nBecause I I think that he really understands\nUh he he really understands that you've got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean Lindsey and this and it's kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to the show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they're willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we we've got to crush the ideas I don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as the kids say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nAh so what does your grandma I liked that he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also think that you know on on immigration and he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him I got to get them a little more hard line on this stuff folksy here's what he said play click bait\nThey're eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning the poor countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to ... based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together ... control who gets the job for legal immigration moved to ... based immigration\nYou can ignore the eleven may and they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think he gets around this when you have folks I think that Lindsey\nEasily ... is a little too squishy on this issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University math nerds for back me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is nine eleven it is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country from Mexico I mean the vast majority of them are from Mexico which also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically within ... with an enormous border\nAnd you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really does I Know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you\nThat when you have a population that has a that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that border we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over that border and then you have a population that maintains a tremendous\nAnd kitchen and tremendously powerful and continuing ties to the the what's considered soldier homeland or the mother country\nA ... you have a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically at a minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is\nA you know he needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is might look I give Lindsey a lot of credit for the whole cabinet thing but as much as\nI'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security well see what happens with this request for a wall and that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat and Lindsey talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half of the wall I mean it scares me five and the Senate has been a path\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that six hundred and Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he wins in court what do we do with these are young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor wall funding for DACA that ...\nThat I think I think you could sell that to the Republican ... if it was full wall funding you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still or it's not a\nA bit of a you know it can't be it can be citizenship and it can't be permanent it's just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the nine eleven but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years\nAnd if you ... by the way I understand that the political sway that\nThe Latino Democrat\nCommunity in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border a ... that will do the entire debate and discussion going forward and all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought everyday will they will be able to turn America into a one party state that's the game the Democrats\nAre flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with them the Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the Republican Party extinct

should know every Tuesday and Saturday morning between\nSeven and I heard radio\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American\nIs is ... laughable to any serious human bit laughable I mean you should laugh about it at the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kind of ... she is she still clings to it but then there's this point it will did she receive any benefit my friends there is so much circumstantial evidence that she received\nBenefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for her law school to then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens in last the hiring\nCommittees think that they can while they can but it's very important to them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their pick they can have anyone they want\nAnd that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nEnlisted gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to gain the system so it just defies belief [laughter] it's completely\nRidiculous I can tell you that I spoke to because I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill or I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I gotta say there are all they were all say it to this is\nJust there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved her case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more trade on this he rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total ... [laughter] [laughter] sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nHe has defeated really the progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great on forest political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting back absolutely\nBut what is this thing about what is this thing about uh oh horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about\nMe a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish and I have thought\nThat ah that that there's no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and ... they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nCabinet allegation and want it's nothing there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels or or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying it was all the campaign finance that's pathetic than no no shot no chance\nUm but I gotta say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jump to the conclusion that Trump actually had had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping inclusion I think that's obvious but why\nAre we so sure a lot of people I Know seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just ... I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of meaning\nShe's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty toward toward the president so\nI'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I thought that maybe he\nAnd I hadn't strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrat but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the president referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like\nA field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle maybe there's just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is\nA and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk are among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still be want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThis wave of a just a restoration of concern or the restoration of concern for our financial future for just so many um so many things that all of a sudden we're at the top of the list right and\nAnd also restoration of the American founding as as a topic of conversation I\nI'm just saying we're we're not we have not done anything about this yet and we've had a Republican House Republican Congress I'm Sorry what was the Senate and White House now for almost two years\nAnd we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is soon going to become one of these issues where\nAre we all talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this but at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about okay we can't tax more fine but\nThe truth is we got to spend less and that means we got to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare and Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel like they paid in and so it's not an entitlement at the government\nYeah making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security that's pretty much true we just use a change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age they're the ones and you're great grandkids are going to be paying the financial price\nFor the care that people are taken out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so yeah we're always told oh there's not enough\nThere's not enough ah it'll revenues there's not a rubber no which there's too much ... more than a rabbit or there's too much spending government has got to rein it in and in last were you know we're\nEither going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action\nWe're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth [noise] so I I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but I I won't harp on it too much talked to Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he certainly the big lever mess [noise]\nAnd we'll be right back [noise]\nBreaks from that is what we do we know drum rotors pads issues the

to mock anyone's family and I certainly would never mock\nA twelve year old girl or twelve year old boy twelve year old anybody\nUm that's not cool that's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old\nAs somebody with strong opinions and who goes home from school and cries about them that's that's not of any interest to me whatsoever would ism interest to me is that that was a clip of Maggie Gyllenhaal all the actress on the view\nAnd she seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an active asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child\nWould feel the need to come home and cry because that young girl met another girl who did not show described as a feminist is because of the parents are engaging\nIn a really relentless\nPropaganda campaign toward their own children now parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that I think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by really instilling in um\nA radical leftist belief and not letting them keep an open minded and develop their their own beliefs\nBut I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues that they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids\nCome to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult you should always be testing and retesting your assumptions and if you're someone who's going to be politically active it's essential to

[noise]\nWhat other issue and we want to thank the president for coming on the other issue that I spoke with rich Samantha and Richard ... a little bit about earlier and\nThat is the first lady who is a classy woman who's trying to do good things millennia cannot catch a break from anybody at any point in time right shouldn't the media traits are completely unfairly\nAnd so the last day or two after the president one is a federal court case against Michael Evan Eddie and the Stormy Daniels president use the term horse face to describes derby day and\nThen when he did that the media especially Brian seltzer and tapper and others and CNN went crazy melt down over the horse face common awful it was and this wasn't about a woman there so it was about women in general see what CNN artfully does is take the comments about one person\nAnd generically apply to everyone in the group because they believe in group rights group identity so in this case horse face ... describes Stormy Daniels according to the president and the media had a virtual meltdown for a day day and a half on ah\nThe president using the term horse face it describes Stormy Daniels\nThat it came out a couple of days ago that TI the rapper is doing an awful video\nWhich are two packs a ... a Trump is a stripper in the oval office\nAnd I saw about three seconds of it that was it for me and I'm not going to watch it\nHowever CNN spent little or no time on the issue that now important rappers or using Vilonia Trump in a strip her outfit engaged in sexual acts in the oval office as if she was working for Bill Clinton\nSo I'm waiting now for the first ladies that are still alive like Roslyn quarter or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama or Laura Bush the former ranks around ...
