talk with your loved one class today it's true\nThe next day to point that should concern us as the trajectory of the increase which is unfathomable\nWhile the overall numbers aren't higher than they were during Obama that is because the numbers dropped way once in a generation load during the first few months of Trump's presidency just based on the perception that he didn't force our sovereignty since illegals saw that nothing changed\nTheir numbers surge beyond belief and the president has been trying over and over again he's been telling us he wants to make changes but the Democrats in Congress are blocking it\nAnd so are some Republicans by the way\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these are ... nuclear families\nWere caught between the points of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months in total one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were apprehended this year

Brock Obama Bernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid\nThe positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took on a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\n\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal\nThen you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this on documented stuff he said now of course these reverse course because they're all about power politics not about country\n\nSo what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democrat Party of ten years ago\nIt's certainly not the Democratic party of Twenty years ago its position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical\nPolicies in attitudes and it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse if the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic\nParty has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\nAnd so now you have individuals who won out radical each other\nHow me who is a centrist and the

what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they call them you know that they're there Mike when there are a people coming from the Syria banned in all of these regions that are going to war\nAnd uh we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe that you which is people that are women cute but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm and I find very interesting I fight and I don't know if I can share on the\nWith you while let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\nOr to lock and monitor skew in Sydney and and others but also of course I rushed out on his real but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have words their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is\nTo look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these bears ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy manage nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual\nIs willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nAre viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me there's not the priority as much liberty for an individual but as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that has imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America\nThey don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent but\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken\nThe European left the progressive left both of which are ... of haggling marks and NGOs and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant the\nEmbrace of western civilization and those sorts of things that's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio

Jeff Zucker\nReleased this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this in ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of\nYou know there's no place for for political violence in American society not worth threats not that the president says here's how the president of CNN response\nQuote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter those far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is this is it's the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's\nWords that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing without even knowing who this is or what the real motivation\nChin is this is the this is a disgrace\nAnd there's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means of getting even with Trump now you know and they also\nView this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both said now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus\nAnd all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them are going to claim victims status over this all the way up until election day\nBefore we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done\nAnd you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of you know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I Do not remember any of them\nSaying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic\nActually shot Steve ... and he almost died and try to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their that they've been calling the president of the United states oh trader or Russians huge a crazy person or rapists or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member\nAnd they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions someone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there's a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are under threat and I and I I Am the ...

in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States\nAll the president's fault you see almost everything that goes wrong in this country according to the left is Trump's fall\nIf someone is a in a high profile sexual assault case Trump's fault if someone says something mean to someone somewhere it's Trump's fall if someone engages in a hate crime or says something racist somewhere it comes from all these people are nuts\nThey have really lost it ...\nYou know that there is this all the Jake Tapper Trump is demonizing them oh as if the media doesn't demonize the president and those around him by the way we CNN makes it very clear that they will not be happy until ... some of the top people in the White House or arrested\nHim and they want them to go to prison that that's clear from their coverage they want to see them in cells the left doesn't just want Trump to no longer be president they want him to be ruined and destroyed\nAn air concocting narratives to achieve that their rights are hoping for they're trying to make it happen I've talked to Carter Page I've talked to Papadopoulos talk these guys this whole thing is we're still is about Russia collusion it's insane and what does Russia\nCollusion really at its core what does it all about Trump is a traitor that's what they're telling Trump is guilty of treason that's what they're saying I'm not making this up\nI'm not exaggerating pressing United States he's a traitor according to meet your media is a traitor according Democratic Party with no evidence but what not\nAnd they want to talk about demonizing place\nRight now we don't often take that many calls here because I get so much of a city we have every single line late and I know there's a lot more people that are waiting to get in and I want to hear from you on this so uh let's get to it a first up Tim in Phoenix welcome to block section show\nOr a minus ... trend\nShe'll time and this group is this what was going well how are you\n[laughter] you buddy a woman I said when you stay with us five ... felt the just over the head of it is it's not all but but it sounds like\nThe last in the media and I'm not saying it's changed a millionaire or a cow Dan\nSemi add a little bit of a tough time a little bit of time here you're saying that this changes the narrative away from damaging things for the Democrats\nYou bet\n... that just as that is true it does do that so there's no question about that they'd much rather talk about this in Trump's rhetoric and how bad he is and then I mean the caravan was a loser for the laugh which they didn't figure out until too late\nAnd and they're still hoping that everybody forgets about what they didn't know Kavanaugh situation so absolutely no I'm waiting\nFor you yeah I actually called ... shields uh uh we've got Charlie in Maryland hey Charlie\n... thanks for taking my call buck I just got a question you dealt with the FBI and their

have this we didn't have this outpouring immunity from all these Democrats after the uh let's just be honest about it much more\nSerious in that somebody was almost killed that somebody was shot shooting at the baseball diamond Alexander I did not see all these Democrats say time to take the temperature down let's stop calling\nBut trader was stopped calling Trump supporters white nationalist and racist I didn't see any of that I I just don't remember it maybe maybe my memories faulty\nAlthough I doubt it that was not what was happening was it now we see that the capitalize on this they try to capitalize on this right away\nSome are more explicit than others here is the view host sunny hostage and we love it\n\nI was in ... thing with my former colleagues to CNN and and they're scared and one highly former colleagues said this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people have tried\nAnd I thought my gosh you know it's at the tone and coming from the top and now than it has become a target journalists that are simply trying to do that I still don't know anything yet about where this is coming from and what the motive as an end to the person or the people are behind it though I I can point to be careful because we don't know yet but\nI didn't get the by you know do they feel like they want to do and it hasn't gotten a bite yet\n\nIt's but it's Trump's fault you see I'm I'm not\nSaying that there's not a correlation here between or clear link between all these different you know these are these are powerful Democrats who have been targeted but that they've been targeted doesn't tell us why they were targeted as in the motivation the ultimate motivation of the perpetrator\nAnd connected to the president is just\nIt's just disingenuous\nA disingenuous a really doesn't have any evidence there's ... there's nothing to try this together than they think the Trump is mean to them sometimes well do they go to the German when Trump is not being mean to them\nDo they get to determine when Trump has finally been acceptable in his expression of criticism about the media one of the best and most powerful things that Trump has done is to challenge the media and to call them out for their biased otherwise\nI don't want him to stop and I refused to allow the left wing media\nTo use this incident to stop it [noise]\nIt's crazy world out

says does that change any of the ... or any of the junior here I'm from the media and there's no\nI actually saw someone said today or I forget the journals another blue jak you know Twitter journal person\nOr say that the Trump statement where he said there's no place for political violence in this country or threats in this country that that was the bare minimum that he said the bare minimum I'm like well does he have to give us an hour long speech on this er ... there's going to criticize the matter what he does\nWhether it's cause show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible noticed you know my objections to a bomb or that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level\nActually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I look at a bomb I sing you know that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to bed and I think\nAll that that that's come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump and now because some maniac\nSomewhere we don't even know why yet but some idiotic somewhere sent these bombs now we're supposed to believe what Trump is supposed to be muzzle maybe here's what they were saying about him earlier in the day it's liquid for\nHow sorry the president flat out lie saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election and gets caught the lie he changes his story again and says we're going to get food eventually\nThe president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid where officially in Paris and in fact ...\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with rights also\nIs not even trying to hide his life and the more he says putting all out there in spreading a lot of lives about non white people to fall white crowd to make a clown a lot of what the president saying sets\nNot true the president seemed to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and have oxygen sales why\n\nThis is a ... an article of faith now have you have to say this all the time\nWhenever asked them what what's the law what they're really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your health care plan you can keep it that President Trump is told one that was done with four thought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that lines up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says\nYou and I can recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do know he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always always jump right to the worst possible scenario\nAnd never get tired of it either oh my gosh you know in the left in the media they they find endless ways\nTo reach a limit on the outrage meter ten is not enough eleven the outrage me in regards his brother I Know I I just get frustrated with it too it's it's so tiresome and\nThey're all their calls for civility right there there are being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftist\nTheir calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they liked the old order\nWhere we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game they're not saying let's all be good to each other day defend the mobs and the restaurants we'll talk more about that later\nThey defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to this stuff\nAnd now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen\nMonths of propagandize to their base the president's a traitor or sexist or rapists or\nA you know a racist or everything\nCrazy\nGoing to start a war is a fascist state there's some things that about President Trump and it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close\nNow they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously is people are these people are really in need of reality check 'em really got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him don't really care to a\nBut this is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the cat when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to be cozy with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika a now because Trump has stumped with is not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants and first doing today is on Christ like I mean this is oh here's what's covers that play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic\nNot only the most basic American concepts are we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read\nIt sounded Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a side in the Bible\nIn fact they despise us so much that they refuse to believe is very important and you can't understand that Trump phenomenon without knowing that he's in that role for very specific reasons we've been trusted him to do certain things that by the way he has been doing\nUm and\nTo shake up the political establishment to take the fight to the left\nYou push for less regulation less taxation all of the things that Trump has been pushing for it and doing that's why he's there he's not there because we think that he never flies off the handle a little bit maybe a little too salty with his language you know as a little bit too much of a a\nMaybe an excessive libido in his past him and all of those things that those those are and it's not that we're not aware of those and it's not that I think those are good things are it's just that on balance I Want all the good stuff the Trump brings to the table and he's doing that but the Nicole walls of the world the world too stupid to make that kind of a calculation\nOr they want to hold us to the Romneys standard of put an ineffective Boy Scout up there so we can tear them apart and then we'll pass you on the head when we put another leftist in who destroys the economy and socialized medicine that's what they want to do\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen or not not on my watch if I could avoid it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very tree interview uh but I wanted to know something 'cause you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what a has a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice that talking about this play eight\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago\nIs still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime as an act as though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate\nSo the the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today yep\nI completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by dish a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the mole or pro which grinds along and with these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges itself is crazy\nIt's nonsense and\nThat affects voting that affects people's mindset about this president and really profound ways so you know the the left\nIs already stacked the deck there already cheating in a sense already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys remembered as I started a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I sent it on this show we got something else that's going to hit us and\nI Can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that\nWell certainly the surprise um\nWe've got to have a job Jones joined us on the mechanisms are those bombs that were going to talk with the caravan so much more show going to switch topics shortly set right there with me team you're up at\nColumbia help on the dot com first name so world's worst boss but one of those jobs on huge national jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just called him a\nCold coming on and on and on top ... American [laughter] on strategy and you clearly said we want quantity not calling ... ... oh\nWell like my mother taught me and at first you don't succeed cut your losses run by a don't even find your perfect global employee at Columbia help on the dot com local jobs that work Columbia help on the dot com first name so world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date\nThey didn't know why we're getting applications from jugglers in tightrope walkers\nI just posted on a national jobs aren't that this job can be a balancing act and you have to juggle many tasks\nBut the job is for head of accounting some of the applicants include lion tamer ... have you met the guys in accounting animals\nDon't real David find your perfect global employee I Columbia help on the dot com local jobs that were\nPossible by an organ donor after I got my new lows I started doing full that I never been able to do I never knew that breathing could feel is good steep climbs to honor his down there and you're made the land of the Oregon ... wouldn't\nWant him like that when you left this beautiful plant it you could save a life and your way out it's low credible gift\nImagine like you can make possible by leaving behind the gift of flying my boy and sign up acting like an ... to shut down their organ donors dot com not just from the U.S department of health and human Senate if our\nFamily you know because when it comes to the fight for so long never tough [noise] sort of a story\nThat folks is about um that have been sent to be in the mail in some cases maybe hand delivered I Want to bring somebody on who is a true bomb experts we have with us Johnny ... Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance\nDisposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an EEO detect\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built\nHow you tracked them and what they can do a job at great to have you oh man thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about these devices bunch of pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there of but what's notable to you about these bombs\n[laughter] well you know I can only go off really the the information from the beginning and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear 'em in so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it was doing it for both ... and the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bonded either once that time or hit a certain time in a pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take the same signal that same electrical signals\nAnd you re route that into a circuit that that name the bombs so that one normally the why would come on the bond at night so but normally the bell wondering when an arm clock\nThe bond that nature um the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it's so switches of breaking a circuit than an arming a and arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so circuits still open but once the army and gets closed in the next thing that causes the switch full set it off so\nWe know and and the use of timing device\nSays they're used for one of two things either to pre determined when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself as the bomb maker time to get away from it\nBefore it's armed and so if this bond as a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture but if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way\nThen we would call this a time device or out of their time to arm or trying to debt day\nAnd being that it was in a seal package\nThere seems to be no other true mechanism of ... of\nThe nation than we kinda have to believe from what we can see that picture that at the time to detonate device meeting they said you know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it would theoretically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey ... in this this is going to be a very\nUh ... I don't know how the sloppy way in and try to target an individual right Emmy assuming this was actually sent\nThrough the mail to just have a timing device on it and you have to be guessing when it would be you know it just sounds like it's more likely could blow up still risk to people could really could kill somebody but could blow up in the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or you know in any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it's it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much information to divulge than in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart any information on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd uh and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it could\nFunction as as as it appears to\nBe in a then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or or take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces that get\nMore easily points in the right direction when I Would say where do you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be ... hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or that someone just hand this time is this someone outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars to take the only thing we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking of the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI will utilize some tools and techniques we have this safely disassembled this bomb\nWell on the ... aunts and uncles I gather there and leave the advice for really getting out and play into enjoy each other's company\nThe guidelines ... outside and as we gathered around the table to gather highlighted the week in here and that this plan on that huge ...\nThose are great memories what will your traditions look like this year maybe this is the year you finally get that dining table that everyone can sit around whether your family as big or small we've got great news for Saturday November third are dining furniture is on sale\nShape in financial dying fail and it's going on now take twenty thick accent Ninety One in shape and and not quite that big bad chess\nIs I mean I I must have ten people have been yelled at until they had to leave restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you I don't know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen and Mitch McConnell yes\nMitch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton distraught and I walk up or what they do but I\nIt's not clear that there was Hillary she leans Seventy something being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll take your protesting something or disagreeing fighter decorated children from their parents and I went to dinner and a Mexican restaurant I Would realize I endorsed third Harlem\nSo there you have the big separation okay ah especially in a day like today where we're going to be\nA lecture by the left about ... about civility all of a sudden even mind that that exchange that was him talking across in show not tonight but last night uh that exchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains and of course talker\nWho people will say looks like book\nSo it's bucking took a or people said that I look like Tucker but they do do it they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but they're having to change and you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know\nThe harassment and stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like\nThat is acceptable they don't\nSay oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us\nThey actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between\nIf are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or or even just the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken\nOn either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little show of one person who just cross it easily they're already screaming her face they're already yelling at you in a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you and trying to intimidate\nYou\nYou really think it's that hard for one of them all of a sudden you know get a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that but what's so important is that the left or you know as soon as those\nIdiots when after Nancy Pelosi I said at every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left or does it below sea wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat oh by the way they talk specifically about that it rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves the restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I've never okay I think what happened that she felt she was fine\nThe other day she was ... and ... she was with her and it you don't see any of our water up and said they had said ... until you leave the palm because you have a ... a policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think in the first one to ... and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not lost during the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like soccer have the kind of platform may do or they can push back on this nonsense you know conservative we had a political\nCulture and in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to\nA you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I don't I don't think this is certainly dangerous to the people right at the Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that you\nKnow ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder what Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment and and uh on Capitol Hill or in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate and and they can they\nFollow you can they fall ever you go\nYou know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a
