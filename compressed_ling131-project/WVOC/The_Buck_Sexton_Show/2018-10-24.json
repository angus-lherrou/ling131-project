Fox News President Trump again talking about sending the military to the southern border to stop the thousands of people from central and South America now in Mexico from entering the U.S the president saying dangerous people are in the group tried to enter\nExisting playing what ever plan you have on Medicare employer plan it doesn't matter what outlaw existing private health insurance number one all of it that includes all employer\nProvided plans individually purchased insurance every single union plan it also means an end to the increasingly popular private Medicare Advantage insurance plans\nAll gone these private insurance plans seniors have been flocking to specifically to avoid enrolling in existing Medicare plan if you like your plan you're guaranteed not\nBe able to keep it they will all be outlawed that's what they mean\nI Know you didn't hear this on CNN and MSNBC\nI Know you didn't hear it on good morning America or the today show you hearing it from me\nThrough the excellent writing investors business daily\nSecond Medicare for all will have the government pay all medical costs\nThere'd be no co pays or deductibles on anything from doctor visits surgery and drugs to long term care dental and vision the only thing not covered would be cosmetic surgery keep in mind no other country on the planet does this\n\nEven in socialist countries like Sweden Denmark people by fourteen to Fifteen Percent of health costs out of pocket\nCandidate doesn't cover prescription drugs and private insurance picks up Thirteen percent of the country's health care bills even in China people buy private\nInsurance to cover co pays and deductibles and the Chinese pay almost a third of health care costs out of their pockets so Democrats listen are rushing to endorse a plan that is more socialistic then communist China's plans\n\nNow Medicare for all they would also nearly double\nThe size of the federal government double the size of the federal government a recent analysis of Bernie Sanders current Medicare for all plan which is supported by Gillum and people like him\nFind said it would cost the federal government thirty two point six trillion dollars over the first ten years and we know these analyses are always wrong they're always low thirty two point six trillion dollars plus free college for every body\nRight free health care\nThe trustees Medicare say Medicare's going broke and eight years eight years so the Democrats have a plan massively expanding and destroyed\n\nIncredible and that's vast\nUnderstatement of its true costs since the analysis assumes drank Kony in payment cuts to providers an unrealistic savings on the ministry of and prescription drug costs but also ignores the enormous cost the delays and rationing that invariably result from government run health care in other words\nAll the people who will die all the people who will suffer when the government takes over a system like this\n\nDemocrats pushing Medicare for all say that those costs are irrelevant\nBecause people will no longer have to pay premiums are spend any money out of pocket but they don't say is that everyone would face huge tax increases to finance this government takeover of healthcare Bernie Sanders plan starts with an eight point four percent hike in payroll taxes\nSharply higher income tax rates and more none of which would fully cover the exorbitant costs\n\nHow many more failed countries ladies in general must we copy this is Venezuela this is the prescription of Venezuela\n\nPhony support for Medicare for all Democrats\nAlso point just surveys showing strong support choose me for Medicaid for Medicare for all a Reuters yeah so's poll found Seventy percent backing it including a majority of Republicans but that's because people have no idea what Medicare for all actually means\nRun Reuters substitutes the term single payer or government run health care support collapses those little is forty percent down from Seventy percent\nAnd that's exactly why the Democrats camouflage their true intentions lie and deceive the American people [noise] but even that's probably too high forty percent\nA separate Kaiser Family foundation survey found almost half of Americans wrongly believe they could actually keep their existing health plans under a single payer system incredibly Democrats are the most ill informed the poll found fifty two percent of Democrats think they'll be able to keep their health care plans\nI mean that's absurd right\nIf they're going to nationalized healthcare a single payer system destroy Medicare destroy all private insurance including your employer insurance by going to keep your plan\nStill lack of public support didn't stop Democrats from opposing Obama Care of the nation eight years ago won't stop them from opposing quote unquote Medicare for all they ever get the chance the only way to prevent such a disaster is they keep Democrats had a power at least until their socialist fevers breaks\nThis is another reason you need to go to the polls ladies and gentleman\n\nThese rogue leftists are so thoroughly and completely irresponsible they want to impose their ideology on you and these have real life consequences it matters to your family it managed to the health of your family\nIt matters to people who have private insurance it matters that people who are on Medicare\nIt's incredible what they'd been proposing Cory Booker and opportunity account as high as fifty thousand dollars for a kid there is no end to what they want to do how they want to manipulate us control us take from us from us\nIt's why I say all the time that progressive ism is an American it's absolutely\nOn America there's absolutely\nNo constitutional support or basis for progressive as a nun which is why they're truly hostile to the constitution as you saw in the last judicial confirmation proceedings I'll be right back [noise] month\nAmerica now with me ... tonight
