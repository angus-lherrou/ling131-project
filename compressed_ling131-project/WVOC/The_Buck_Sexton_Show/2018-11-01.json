side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights stack fires and Nazis energy to hear that opening montage\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know it it you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs the success or the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it\nOr that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see we have suffered the consequences of Donald

it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of\nSome of the most celebrated names in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power in ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\n\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite they they hate Trump more because he is

this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up by right we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we\nTry to take a rational approach to it and and even a somewhat just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case I Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that has the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone\nNow we now we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it\nBut the calls for civility from Democrats for the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHave been in bad faith what they want is for conservatives had for Trump and for the right to engage in self doubt and just stop fighting\nAnd there'll be no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle window right decides to stop pushing for its beliefs and what it thinks is correct\nAnd what is best for the country all you will have is the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw for the eight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces in it at every opportunity right to\nThe left under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outposts number bay and adding all the survivors\nAid was rough\nThere was no good faith there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow where you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country in the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition\nSome would say our

just a I guess it's kind of a U.S kind of a preview\nOf the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held illegal aliens or should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before\nAnd when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens means there is of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic ah their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this age children of slate\nWith the ... yeah the fourteenth amendment was well as for it was for yeah the the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but\nIt should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's wing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country ah yeah they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and\nYeah he has every right to do that yeah\nI think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much for calling calling from Maryland Stephen in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Steven\nHey hey hey Mr ... all the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful and I really appreciate that you're very kind on the other thing that they don't want to mention and boy that the thing of ties in with Don Lemon\nDa da da da da da da ding ... class voters\nOn and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of the union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I was wondering and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare\nAll day because there's a crisis on the caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think the idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is left or right to pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically\nNew immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on\nWelfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you you cannot be a dependent on the state and that you know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor of the anchor baby issue once you have an as a child who is a is is given citizenship here to uh to illegal parents\nBenefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nA government benefits you have to give it to the parents\nEight seven seven six

Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is at nova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author Fulbright Scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] they'll teach adults to start up here for patients foil a cyber attack [noise]\nDon't think you're settling with an education\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking\nAbout here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he tweeted out to politifact today are are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass\nShooters who are white males that were if anything political leftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that they will uh they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of measures in this country um\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation or for all the different ethnic groups in this country but uh your ears would you find out they've never mass shootings but I'm an\nOverall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other\nConversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed um but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male\nSo as we remember we're being told white males or the bad guys we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat\nI'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy with some radio show I've never heard of says Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country the country's also\nSeventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but only fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nOf other groups that are non why their shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places think they're really making about this I mean one member I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and really pointless exercise uh but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOr ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity\nOr whether we agree with that or or not\nUm then you get to the terrorism side as an odd sort of make this brief ah that that the GED torch mafia a moron from Charlottesville\nIs talked about so much in the media just goes to show you that they can't find where where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist him saying how many are there really very very few\nAndrew referred to that as a rise of a real terrorism in the country and that's the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national counterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security

Fox News President Trump making the final push for Republicans with just six days to go until the midterms this evening in Florida or Senate candidate current governor Rick Scott ... sent\nIt's not hard for you to beat a dispassionate stop being a bunch of babies stop being a bunch of cry babies you know and it's up acting like\nBecause people at Trump rallies yell mean thanks to you every conservative I Know has been who's in media has been getting\nA horrible things censored them set about them death threats all kinds of and some of them actually get assaulted and attacked\nI can think of prominent conservatives being physically assaulted in the snow and cold there was one of the tax giving a speech once on camera you know people have actually been ...\nDoesn't happen to lives lives don't get the live lives when they're giving speeches don't get attacked it's just not the same and it's not the same mentality out there right now\nYou know the Trump people see this is really the difference that I Know they're gonna say oh ... what about the Trump supporter you're the guy was the media and their maniacs can support and you know anyone in anything\nAnd I mean you know we hear very little about the family Research Council shooter for example but he was all about you know the MSNBC talking points and and once you wanted to kill people who were\nPro life and and pro traditional family or you know how a lot of you're probably the buck would even talking about if you go and do a you know do a quick Google Search on that you'll be like wow\nThis guy was a left wing terrorist but no one ever refers to him that way he was that's what he was he was he left for any and he actually Sharpie\nSo it wasn't it wasn't just an attempted something or wasn't just sending in threats he actually took the kind of like the Bernie Sanders shooter who didn't try to show up at a baseball field but got caught on my way or something got there in shock people and almost killed them very nearly killed these beliefs so\nBut Stewart understands this this dynamic and now now look I Am a big\nCritic of the whole John Stewart clown nose on clown nose off thing it's like you know it's like ... I'm don't do it I'm all funny on ... and then oh well now let me lecture you well on the constitution and my Christiana I'm I'm poor impression voice it's like no\nIf you want to engage in political issues you have to be willing to when you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have\nI just have fake puppets going into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest\nAnd Stuart's done lots of that you know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them\nAnd if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just took what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there's reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this but the live idea always\nComes out on top and that's the last with those outlets\nDo to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is is winning but\nThat the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality this is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN's apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead they're liars they're liars tapper wire\nBlitzer wired I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper all or at all I mean Donald limited as like a whole other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about that as George right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliance ear yeah the narcissism is what\nNarcissism is what the Trump taps into of cars look he understands people with\nBig egos Trump is a very very big ego we I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very good testicle guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that because even if something else is\nKind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believes that happened so I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have\nA bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember and then you know\nBe humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a from Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just\nReally has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing that they can come up with as an answer because it's so once you get told the oh yeah that's right why is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta why is every a criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you're the Serbian all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this than a vast majority of people who are in the business I don't say that to be a modest and just being object I'm being honest with\nYou and very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that\nUm but that's not to say that I also don't ... I Am lucky I Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I Am lucky that this is my job this is my job this is my calling\nIn my career because of all of you who listen to the show you are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment\nOr needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this but I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American\nBooks such dinner else of course not right that's that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ties that that some of these big outlet they really think\nRob Lowe and everyone's saying is there a secret subpoena out there I I Can't help but feel like\nThis is a this is the media just\nJust trying to throw one little\nAnd I look at this theory I'm not telling you this I I don't have any sources on this I'm just analyzing what has been reported but I Can't help but feel like this narrative that just came out today or is there a secret subpoena pro Trump they're trying to make some people out there remember you know and I know that this was all garbage\nYou know when I Know that there was no Russia collusion that people think there was are delusional and you\nKnow and all the rest of it but there are people out there there are people who are still oh I'm On the fence\nAbout this I don't really know and if they hear that there was a secret subpoenaed for Trump they may say wow I guess maybe there is something to that you know I'm actually going to go for the Democrat last minute I think I'm going to cast my vote if it's a tight election I'm not really sure and you know I I\nBelieve the rhetoric about healthcare and pre existing conditions at all that stuff I Want to go the Democrat remember how upset they got the media about coal me saying that they were reopening Hillary's email investigation whatever that was a couple of weeks before the election remember how just oh my God it was a terrible so unfair\nI think that they would feel completely a\nJustified in what is essentially a bad face leak story like this meant to create the perception that there's more to the Russia collusion narrative than there is I I think that that ... you know that's something that\nCould very well of happened and you know I haven't spoken much about this uh this summer I think there's nothing that only journalist really care about but I'll just give you the quick in the quick and dirty on it so there was a a guy tied to the gateway pundits\nOh whose name is actually is keeping me right now but he ah what is this guy's name again I'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old for rights Internet personality who was written for the gateway pundit um he\nAllegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Mueller and sexually harassed her in the most\nHam fisted\nStupid ridiculous kinda transparently obvious thing imaginable basically was offering women money to live out more\nI was going to get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would kind of mess with right now if you know that's I don't care who you are fake sexual assault or fake sexual harassment allegations are despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any you know if somebody levels fake sexual harassment allegations against Hillary why\nI wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that right we can get a run on the other crimes she's committed but you don't ever\nPut fake stuff out there but this gateway pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pond that he uh looks like he tried to entice somebody to lie about Mueller and that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell you for all the nonsense about Russia collusion how it's going nowhere\nMowers of federal prosecutor special counsel a lot of power I Will not mess with\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that that is that\nTalk about how the media is not to be\nTrusted we often sometimes discussed voting the lives of got somebody you could say has expertise in both of these matters joining us now amber ... with a she is a a writer at the Daily Caller she's the media and breaking news editor ever or whatever on the show\nThank you so much for having me back\nAll right let's first talk 'cause I I Know you spoke at American University so you went into the campus gauntlet recently and had to deal with all all that craziness and there was even a little bit of backlash after you spoke about before we get to that just something a little bit about some of the the hateful rhetoric that's used against Trump in your piece\nDefinitely so I decided to take a look at it is because the media has of course\nThen blaming Trump's rhetoric for the re than on scores of hate crimes including the hype on such a democratic officials and then on the anti Semitic attack a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd I thought to myself I've been covering the media for about a year and a half now and I can let ten things off the top of my head that they've said about ... that are just hateful and in some cases even violence so on this list you'll find things like\nUh Nicole walls and MSNBC saying that she wants to ring White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is lack you how to CNN gas a jet yesterday\nSaying that she believes Trump has I'm radicalized more people than ISIS which is a literal terror group that has a hundred thousand numbers I and just the list goes on and on Rick Wilson threatened to got a panelist on CNN like a fish\nSo likely to the knee as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric friend fight that they need to take a look in the air and think about the things that you're saying as well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to have seen in the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a refrain of dealing when it comes to media that you know they basically just saying the conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right they they I don't want and I think it was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side on on Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd that ... people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country and the literal than Brett\nSo these people they talk about er speck in the other side and rationing down its course and being respectful but they're often the worst offenders\nNow tell me about your foray into a into a campus speech here in the swamp area recently it it got that quite a bit of bugs\nYeah it got pretty sloppy so I spoke at American University and I was talking about due process on specifically in the ... of course the Kavanaugh hearing that took place several weeks ago\nOr he accused of gang rape of all things and as soon as the event with announced probably within thirty minutes during our students started posting on social media about how they were going to try to shut down the beach they had a plan fate space\nTo physically hide themselves from what I was going to stay on and then after the event that group that invited me on American soil every actually denounced might talk altogether and said that I was being inflammatory by defending the content of speech and talking about it on social media\nSo all around this is just another example of how college campuses nowadays\nUm have no interest in listening to opposing points on and when they do have to listen to opposing airplane say without an act like children and colleges just aren't a place anymore where dissent is a welcomed and where people like a ... now place where people have to be physically shale that for anything they disagree with and\nI got to say this is the first time I've heard of the the conservative group kind of back stabbing the conservative who's been invited on campus that that's a bit of a weird wrinkle\n[laughter] yeah I certainly was not expecting at is the first I've heard of it as well on and I was definitely disappointed because\nIf these people expect conservative ideas to win out on campus and they have to be willing to defend them and yet by nature at twenty to thirty students shelling out to protest that they immediately back down and through the under the\nVery weak sauce I got to say [laughter] yeah I suspect conservatives called yeah yeah I expected jurors that are going back to ... especially on campus about this stuff because a vote and I guess they wanted to get invited to the sigma stigma", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "01"}
