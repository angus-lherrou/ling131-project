that\nUh you know we we shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ... so friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations\nAre we allowed to embrace that he's\nSaying things that we like and pushing ideas that we like now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whenever it was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate same now that's not a standard that we hold anyone's you've never mind to a celebrity so you know there's a little bit of\nI don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there are some applause with caution here I think in order for all kinds of your situation and then there's also the everybody just needs to calm the hack down\nOur meeting was acting like Trump went and played ... holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to him and say oh he's profane the uh profane the office of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office\nLiterally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff\nThen have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example of what I'm Talking about John of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in ... at CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get\nA buck slapped if you will ... or ... ... you know what I mean ... bucks slapped um and\nIn turn I actually managed to turn the tables on her\nAnd she told me she interrupted the once and told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her oh she has to eat it out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response is competing members this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following an in response to this whole commenting today\nCounty west has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth could've met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but lets me Kanye on election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats she's totally free to do that\nBut just say that ... has chat back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community set us back a hundred and fifty five years\nWell this one does the math on that it seems a bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say\nHere you have a world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world\nThis is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's a leader of the free world among other things being a deity a but there's no ... there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and say yeah that's degrading\nFor any group of people never mind for black Americans but this is just the oval office and I think that the way they get to this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they've they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions in the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... an interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne\nIf you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect\nThat one would give a present he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself and so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage or not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but to any normal person that's just crazy it's just crazy\nThat is the most accurate way to describe it and there were some meltdowns today there were some meltdowns that were incredible I mean ethic meltdowns where is that John do we have an

around us but I just thought that bell she enroll\nFreak out was pretty incredible yeah okay so ... just hanging out with Trump said some pretty\nPretty outlandish things who cares it ... it doesn't mean anything it's interesting and here's a guy who you know and not another part of this that I Will say I find I Do find distressing\nIs that you've had a lot of media people saying that well we can't take ... seriously because because he's mentally ill\nI think that's really disgusting thing to do just because ... had sought mental health treatment at one point it does not mean that he does not get to have a voice you'll be taken seriously the rest of the rest of his life in fact that's a terrible message descent and a lot of people you know I Know people\nWho are incredibly successful who have had real mental health struggles and we want people to always go they'd be like saying oh you've got a terrible infection and your legs don't go see a doctor right\nThat's that would be crazy same thing for a bit of a mental health problem so to stigmatize in that way and say ... because you sought treatment for I think it was bipolar disorder but I don't remember\n'em then we can't take

that\nThere is a concern right now I mean what I heard that not sound like someone [noise]\nComing clearly to talk to the president's about issues that are\nThat are in the black community when it comes to issues of Kanye West bringing black people to a President Trump that is that's a misnomer a kind of a west has made a large portion of the African American community upset about his comments about race or about his comments about slavery so at this point Kanye West um\nHe's exposing himself more and more and the highest office in the land this is not just a moment on TMZ this is not just a moment and uh on me without being the car dashes or whatever that show is this for the world to see the world saw Kanye West and the raw reality TV show we were watching I mean\nWe can you can use John do I mean give me a favor just play the beginning of that when we're just just the first couple of us wanna make sure everyone here is actually starts us off\nThe air is a concern right now I mean what I heard not sound like someone [noise]\nComing clearly to talk to the president's about issues that are that are in the black community when it comes to\nOkay so ... clearly you know she's she's also when there's a very serious in her analysis of all this but you do have\nThese these groups these uh these different panels on TV who go on there and they will discuss specifically the county well a Kanye West was\n... you know in ... in a place where you had to go seek mental health treatment\nYou know they'll say that oh he's crazy essentially for a prominent what they're saying this is what they're saying for a plumber prominent black celebrity in America to embrace Trump and ... and believe in this movement is evidence of being crazy\nOr is only possible if you are crazy that's what they're saying\nAnd I don't think that they know who the crazy one really is but that's what they are telling you I Can't help but notice that one of the uh favorite tactics of the Soviet Union that continued on even into the poop narrow\nFor dealing with the most hated posts\nCritics of the regime you don't just want to lock up a political credit card you don't want to lock up dissidents and they become heroes they become martyrs if you kill them\nBut what if you can get them committed to a psychiatric facility what if somebody who criticizes the government can be declared insane by the state and committed to be with other crazy truly crazy people in sub par you know horrific conditions in\nThe interior of Russia or in Siberia that's what they used to do they still do it there are allegations they still do it at least in Russia\nIf you are too much of a thorn in the administration side I guess in the regime side or they will have you committed they've done it before they ... they tried to do to journalists by the way as well they have not yet to my knowledge kidnapped\nChopped up and uh and kill the journalist in a conflict of a foreign country but we'll talk about that we'll talk about the show the issue in ... I'm going to spend some real time on that went through because it's a big deal\nIt's a big deal raised some very interesting questions for us and we're talking Saudi Arabia you're talking about something that does have an effect on the economy and and is not it's not possible to just\nCoordinate off and pretend like it's not there but back to what they're saying oh you're here here's the better and so you got a variety there she obviously he's very opposed to Conyers saying this stuff and he's not addressing the concerns of the black community I also just think it's such a it's always taken for granted that the\nBlack community views politics from this perspective from this completely United and singular perspective and know group of people are are\nThe black communities rough it's about eleven or twelve percent of the country I think right now if you're talking about let's call thirty to forty million Americans\nAre black thirty forty million Americans are black I'm sure as you know ... it's it's the size of a it's a good sized country just on its own the black humid in this country there are so many ideas and so many different approaches to politics within that community but\nThey they they pretend like there aren't a you know the the Democrats pretend like there's only one view that's allowed only one view that's acceptable\nSo you know April Ryan she's and she's a

and put this on their air and I got to tell you\nI'm not I'm not aware of their your producer Mike has there been an apology or attraction or anything about this now I have not seen anything so a prominent black American a famous wealthy self made black American gets to hang out with the president on incredibly friendly terms a lot of press for it\nI'd I don't listen I'm but I Know some of the

I don't know I Can't imagine waking up every day and being such a a hysterical Pearl clutching lip I really can't it must be a very well I was gonna say a very sad way to go through life but maybe that explains why there's all these rage mobs running around the left\nThose mobs folks people have seen them and it's starting to show up in the Senate polls that's right\n... getting an advantage of

it's it's really just a battle of rumors right it's just ... people say things there's no evidence there's no there's nothing to say we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create\nA parallel process to the legal process that the less can control now impeachment is in fact a parallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they are gearing\nUp for so whenever we tried to have the argument that Trump was not found guilty\nWhen it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office a which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of now they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the racism and massage\nAny and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments on policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle\nOf reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's you know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's massage us or not and just oh he's eighty don't vote for him he's ... which is really what they want to convince\nEverybody about Trump all along but there there's a development in his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify ... define ... what does that get pi him take away is pie defying\nA GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition the lawyer Joshua leddy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his\nRight not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of the constitution ah now I understand\nThat this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward who would take the fifth and we would say that it's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern\nIn general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information\nDoes not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public well when that's the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation amount of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things\nIt's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tier and smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just wouldn't know that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller\nKnows that you know to to put more kinda\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're going towards more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be until after the election and we get more information but the the Democrats are a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and ... the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to set a Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but I Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues at the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I'm I'm holding out hope that Trump declassify those Pfizer documents\nOn the investigation origin documents that that I think he should do before the election because in my opinion that could be a game changer\nYou've ever found yourself when sing at the weak sauce taste of coffee from one of those left leaning

take this\nAnd they won't say you know what it is we shouldn't do this they'll just say well you know people are angry this is what people are going to do is what they want to do so you know it it is what it is but that that really\nThat is the attitude that you get from them or ... you know where's the corollary so you don't have the corollary or the um the analogous position on the right when it comes politicians there is no right wing version of antifa there's no right wing version of the Democrats who are saying get up and people's faces and follow them home\nThere is no right wing version of lunatic protesters who show up wearing genitalia on top of their heads and and screaming and shrieking at Senate committee hearings you know there's there's none of that we don't do that\nAnd so I think it's important to take a moment for all of a say there isn't a both sides thing this mob mentality this shrieking and threatening and crazy behavior is is is\nA problem predominantly in overwhelmingly of the left\nAnd it's going to be a problem for them at the polls unless they can lie to enough Americans and act like this is a problem so we won't let that happen folks we won't let

they see the difference when they wake up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere [laughter] they're getting out at that time a lot of money that people\nI think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump as I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more\nNow that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they warned about oh oh Trump twenty two at the moment we should get rid of him but they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to

it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise

but it's something that's been on my mind for a while team so I'll share it with you\nAnd then you have these these never Trump or types\nWho have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well a switch gene or that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from\n... not exclusively government backgrounds but I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and their of their system in all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one\nHe isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because he he become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in

you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the ... the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June ... advisory wars were ... or ... or ... horse and buggy whip it offers and\nYou know you get these guys do the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government working and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better then somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector in the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that there's a real resentment of this and I and I'm really aware of but now that I'm In the swamp in DC they've really\nDon't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out\nAnd also it but this the insecurity of losers you know ...\nThat is very clarifying um and I don't mean people that aren't rich you know that has nothing to do with being a loser or being a winter I mean people who lack of self confidence people who lack the ... the true belief that\nAnd our state championship tradition\nWith their read your way to the gang contests students can qualify to win tickets to the Carolina Clemson gang one plant and one Carolina fan will win for tickets to the big game does it seem very dot org or ask your teacher for ... sponsored by the read ... and ...\nAnd Michael Olivas disruptive powerful\nIt was the fastest Sarah can anybody said it just for me it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy food is paying now following hurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water and\nAnd everything that people can live on the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric company is the survey and claimed right now they're being a for the most part\nThey're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity is already back on that sort of Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration\nIs showing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast\nA but one interesting ... first priority at first thought of everybody is getting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life and proven to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nOf but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement\nA gentleman's agreement among politicians that when something like this goes on you will\nYou will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks uh you had Ron descent as his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called them a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire it sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so\nI think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the ring attack ad in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were trying to other bad down the hatches or ... or or wait until they can return to their homes by word of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home over to feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it and I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with\nAll the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these Florida raises our people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race 'em and they're going to try to\nExtrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea here being that Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies and his prose and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be a but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American um and and that's\nWhat the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see the\nMinority representation and they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nOr identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff\nBut the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category for hurricane to take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so I think that gives you a sense of aware that all is\nAnd uh I I I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but it's going guys going to make is going to make a close very close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you and I just I've been waiting to have a night

I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured him and beat him to death\nOf rural murder and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's it's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast base paper claims they have a source telling them that the body parts of ...\nSo the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in the residents of the consul general of ah of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi\nOfficial may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks either this is if you write about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on that so that so outrageous not only is this\nNot if you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are by the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll get to some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have pretty good\nIntelligence and police forces and plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on the Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if he went to Saudi ... will be off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared\nAnd nobody would know so they did this in Turkey\nA well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states\nBut that the Saudis would do this is so brazen\nAnd now you have all these different politicians you'll Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay you know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey but people are saying is going to be held to pay\nA seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal\nBroad daylight you know ours assassination inside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil\nThis is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off you know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely order and at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top level Saudi Government processed by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen\nAnd people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be ... former Russian nationals\nThey've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in their former Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russia national and\nThey never do it in a diplomatic facility though and they certainly wouldn't send\nMultiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not so foolish as to do this but then you get to the ... the ... then you get to the buck then you get to the point where you have to ask ... hold on a second\nTo the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are set in the past that you know sometimes burning on village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sense a stronger message too\nBut you don't have to burn down everything\nYou can just make an example of one\nAnd here you have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia sitting in the Saudis or a mafia stayed with a religious veneer I mean but Saudi Arabia is a is a a ... you know the ruling family has enriched itself to the tune of\nWho knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades now Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive goes all the way back to the unholy\nAlthough they would have thought it was holy alliance between the fundamentalist preacher\nOn the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteen century\nLeave he was born in Seventy no too I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety two litter maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merge together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer Salafis and Salafis means the forefathers of the a Muslim face\n... itself as as fundamentalism such Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd a ... you know literally some textural ism although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if you've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of\n'em but they killed ... they they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic so you know I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this\nWhat looks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember stay with the\nSocial media sites are the future of conversation my friends we notice I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but we've seen so much\nOf the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises\nHave all kinds of left wing conversational how shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you Snoopy dot com maybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators\nSuppressing your freedom of expression totally free to join check it out for yourself\nAs an I.
