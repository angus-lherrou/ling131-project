should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on Mars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter]\nThe Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell so very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes that way to liberals camera phew what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence a opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper levels in their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it\nNow why am I bring that up now not to give you the go well what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe unleashed they just a torrent of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News on that in Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on [noise] remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump by the time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank that's in my book and lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reasons the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried to ... for bank and all that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there\nDon't shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here is the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberal Paris there's two ...

Fox News Saudi Arabia conducting its own investigation into the disappearance of journalist ... went missing three weeks ago at this hour and a consulate in Turkey\nMedia that's for a feverishly and fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming I it could be one way or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with that keeps happening today but she released the information from her her test today\nRight or she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and uh many would say the bong\nNative American heritage is now back\nIn the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe\nWhere the vast majority of orange family tree is European is it says that she has a date of American ancestry code in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so\nThis is a really a non scientific background ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth\nNative American and the Boston Globe and actually did the math wrong on that one\nUh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here and\nThis was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because\nThis was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will\nThis wasn't a some surprise that a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected to the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position\nThat this would bolster her claim I don't know which is worse here uh that Elizabeth Warren is show delusional\nShe thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it as to think that this will stop continue mockery of her for racial fraud\nI mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil is it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago\nAnd since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American\nCompared to the general white American population she is less than average in her connection to the Native American population meaning you and to me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have been white an American\nIs likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are here we are she she must have thought that this was going to uh give her some degree\nOf of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago there's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate\nAnd then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis and you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all\nKinda hazy and nonsense anyway\nQuote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of orange DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford\nA really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on an ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um fish folks\nIf Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country critic credibly claim to be Native American for professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even\nMatter if you call yourself [noise] Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by their standard\nDisease completely nuts this is completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed\nTo force this incredible uh on for stare on on her part\nIs just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top\nFour or five of early support from the Democrats for running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as\nBeing CNN poll out where I think she came in for third or fourth place um and and when you look\nAt this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is amazing to me\nThat anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter]\nI mean she's she's like one one thousand Native American may be and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border in the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes\nYet people in the media was saying sushi proved it Trump\nStrong Trump needs to pay up now\nWhat what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren\nHas completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has to go even further and they have to somehow pretend like yeah that's right she proved\nThat that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it\nBut well what else are they going to do I mean this is a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nEighties bonkers\nAnd all this notion even at that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from this pose a this analysis in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison\nThis is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases to make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis use samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia just stand in for Native American\nThat's because scientists believe that the groups Americans referred to as Native Americans came to this land via the bearing straight about twelve thousand years ago\nSo then what's now America but also market further south his report explained the use of reference populations genetic material has been sequenced for was designed for ... accuracy\n[laughter] that's right folks and that would be president of United States the Democrats\nSubmitted recipes to powwow chow and claim to be a Cherokee oh my gosh six word used offensive racially charged language to defend her claims of Native American heritage declaring that her family had quote high cheekbones like quote all the Indians do\nSeven word has now claimed that she may have one one hundred one thousand and twenty fourth Indian DNA this is equally problematic since DNA science proves the average white American has point one point up point one eight percent Indian DNA far more than warrants\nOh my gosh and then I'll skip whether you're going to nine weren't DNA did not report did not measure actual Native American DNA and ten it is very difficult to argue the war did not commit racial fraud or that that was all courtesy of Ben Johnson but my favorite is the\nPower wow ouch [laughter] to our show oh man\nAnd and I see from my friend David French over National Review that she ah from what we were apparently from from what I see you're from David she plagiarize that recipe from a French chef\nSo that's right folks white as white can be Elizabeth Warren pretended to be Native American submitted a recipe to a Native American cookbook as a Cherokee and she stole that recipe from a French chef [noise]\nOh my gosh you can't make this stuff up\nYou really can't it it's just it's hard to hard to come up with a way that this whole story\nCan gets crazier it it really is it's hard to come up with the way that this could be even even more absurd and more bizarre I'm ... sure enough the lips if they can find a way they will if there's anything that they can point to hear\nThat will distract or you know she says six to ten generations ago\nShe has a Native American ancestor she'd doubled down on this I mean she thinks this is vindication\nI Know you could say book how does this how does this really matter what one keep in mind that this week\nThere is a very serious a lawsuit that's not even lost a trial I should say that's underway where Harvard University's has to defend itself against claims of racial bias against Asian Americans and if there's any justice Harvard will lose\nSo the do racial entitlement state is very real\nAnd the left is supportive of it and they have

is what it is right that is going on there\nUm but and you got these people with with his antifa groups that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I I forget exactly even what the what the group was called um let me do a quick refresher on that one but you know you sure enough you had\nYou had this uh this violent incident where your protesters and counter protesters here we go bears spray\nAnd bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march in Portland\nYou have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention\nBecause there's a lot of a political hedging that goes on there is a lot of usage I kind of weasel words and what they believe in what they take out of these descriptions for example\nJust because the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer group I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and has a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I've no idea there are too many of these little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry ... Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist any any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive\nFundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases in any group that has\nTo pay a multimillion dollar settlement too much it was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to check with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations and and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that's that's one part of it but then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle they want to fight people and the fact that they showed up at their spray and these other things tells you all that you need to know\nUh but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not cover this this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you'd think they'd want to tell you have a almost entirely white by the way\nAntifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot\nPrayer group over there they're called the law and order a group or rather they weren't a march for law and order\nA I've got an I've got to wonder is is that just say is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened\nFor example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of procedures just showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems well maybe it's because they showed up in the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nYou get any game and they gauge it you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and from being a Nazi and they wanna they wanna hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals and you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization\nIs that to date anti has put a limit on the degree of their violence where they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something\nLethal action against Syria but they have engaged in violent action and keep in mind that that violent action\nIf you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly\nAnd all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past\nWhen it comes with violence may maybe in a position where\nThey feel like that is open to them and in fact that's the path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists to remind me a lot of antifa or the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the the the sort of what I mean real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they were the ones who are assassinating presidents tried to blow up a stock exchange\nThat's right it was anarchist not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there is another incident on a friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight\nA there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys and I've never really understood ...\nWho they are or what what they are I I I've heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McGinnis and ask him and the metropolitan Republican club invited the proud\nBoys and which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who are just there to have a discussion\nI I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and you show up at one of their events are are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation\nOr you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys I mean this is\nThis or that question what are they really doing that [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security reasons as hard not to worry about

the reputation I've sort of a million times is general general all that still is true\nAh and maybe maybe Trump was just being offhand maybe it was just kind of messing around I have no idea I've no idea I Will say this in my experience and I mean some of my personal experience the generals who are well or really well thought of by the media\nTends to be\nPeople who won cultivate a certain persona with the media and to also or as a little more\nShall we say willing to take a a point of view that would be well received by academia and the media on a\nWhole bunch of things you know I I've noticed is before generals starting to get very political and generals like we love is this true amount of I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general betray us\nI was not surprised by it all 'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying\nFor his own purposes to to create this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military mind a generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low\nBy the extramarital affair and the woman and the classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are a hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but\nHis strategy or was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work I Would note that the strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work\nWas not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case\nSo while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all those credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation Afghanistan I understand that he's not that portrays was not this uh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond reproach period but also when it came to the strategy\nSo that's much more of saying I Need to do a little more I Need you a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long\nMaybe he just rather present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat I also they've kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat\nIs kind of a a little sly a you know ... you know that\nTrump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to\nWe need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to\nHear a lot about a so then I take a step back and I say hold on a minute given what we know about all the different leagues and all the people\nThat are in the White House including Republicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump but all we know that there's somebody right now who wrote if you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we are working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out who this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody as White House of course the ... to do that and that's also I give him more leeway than I Would in other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if you're a Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you talk about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nTo the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and I love when they do\nThe you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me things really are some of them you know that something you know to me it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the\nFacade of you know I'm really going to use them access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better\nYou know they're like off the record I volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so I guess\nSo ah and then you know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here\nWith Leslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position or since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that they stole the dissent than they always do well it's your policy\nAnd up in the middle of the night on my bathroom breaks to check Twitter that check social media to have that ... with an ex boyfriend to save my last piece through an email to ... to a colleague at work and I I was my body was suffering mine mine was suffering and I decided you know what\nI Want to change that's ever want to figure out why this is happening why are we so addicted and be I Want to take\nSome steps to make that easier and I want to show people this does not have to be something that gets fixed through\nGovernment regulation or government involvement or oh we're going to step in and we're going to make a whole bunch of rules and laws this is something that needs to get fixed through people making a decision to change the way they use the technology that life it'd be south empowered to um [noise]\nYou know make these changes that I felt that it kind of like a personal responsibility manifesto for twenty Eighteen\nWow well what what happened when you started actually taken back responsibility away from the machines\n[noise] so what I did was I started small you know everybody said\nOh you know how you're going to do this I started small and I turned off the notifications on my phone which was amazing you have to ... you can still go into those states that you can decide hey I Want to be active on Twitter or Instagram or face but but if you don't have that constant strain of notifications beckoning you to those sites\nYou have a lot more peace of mind you feel much more in control of those cases I\nTook the phone out of the bedroom and I said you know what when I go it's my bedroom I usually go in and got an hour before that I hang out and now I watch either you know old\nFriends episodes or I I read a book or I just kinda chill out that was a time I didn't want to be staring at the phone and what research shows actually that's really interesting is that even if you're not on the phone if the phone is by you even if it off and there's no notifications coming through nothing you are\nPerturbed you are distracted because you are compelled to want to touch that phone to want to look at that divide so I just remove it from my face I also did something really simple when I was with friends I said you know what\nI'm going to try something for these three hours I'm just going to put the phone in my bag and I'm not going to worry about it I'm going to take an actual break I'm not going to run on my bathroom break you know while we're waiting for dinner to calm and check every possible feature on the phone I'm just going to get my mind a chance to Iraq and when I started\nTo see the impact that I really said wow there's something here that\nAre on the next episode of ... thrived global pod cast with Arianna Huffington she discusses our beliefs are influenced

have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment\nWhat happens you journalist Jim all showed\nThe entire world seems absolutely sat on trying to get an answer to that question what what what happened to this Matt how how was it that\nHe was able to uh disappear from the Turkish consulate in in in ... there were other for me it constantly Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd now we have this very real looming international relations crisis on our hands or how did we how did we get to this point how do we find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with this you know the the president has raised the possibility of rogue killers\n'cause the president's I'm sure he said that he spoke to a king Solomon behind the scenes keep in mind the king of Saudi Arabia is a\nPretty uh\nWhat's the word in for old men at this point it's really a NBS Mohammed bin Salman ... who is the thirty three year old crown prince he's the guy who runs stuff and he's the one who has done this whole charm offensive in this country in big business and big media and big government all being buddy buddy with M.\nB. S. so that's why this is such a shockwave through the elite communities the the Davos set is little oh my gosh we do know we can if we can have the Saudis funding trips for us anymore uh and and there's there's the reality of what the soldiers of Saudi Arabia which is interesting and I don't get to that\nI'm ... and there's also the pending probably will be the case at some point when you watch the ... when you listen I'll watch when you listen to this show I Will have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like they are planning to say that this was a rogue elements within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a it may be the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line\nUm but the Saudis can hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on it so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep dissemble ing on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a gym here I'm as they should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies\nBut here's what you see the ... the pivot that's going to happen it's already started to happen because you have this issue of a repressive ...\nMuslim how often you hear about that a Muslim majority nation not just the Muslim majority nation entirely Muslim nation the most Muslim country by percentage I Believe in the world maybe Somalia I mean there are a couple of other countries that are right up there but the Saudis do not allow non Muslims\nTo be you know citizens of the peninsula I mean the Saudis are do they do not allow Christian worship or ceremonies were houses of worship to be a Jew can be built on on Saturday So this is a a hyper Islamist\nGovernment which you don't ever hear hyper Islam his regime\nThat I talked to a little bit about that holy but unholy alliance between the ... hobbies uh the Salafis fundamentalist Islam and this Bedouin tribe a house of Saud that as the Saudi regime Saudi royal family\nShows you know there's all this complexity on the issue but but here's what what's happening right now this is going to quickly become a crisis that ... that is much more about what Trump does for our media than what it really means I'm already hearing you know\nBecause Trump ... up with dictators that's why this happens this is the line you're there's all the time Trump is show is coddled dictators here's what I Want to say that anybody in response to that cause you'll hear this all over the place to meet in the next few days I don't think it's possible to call dictators\nMore than Obama did I I think it would be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians is strongly for one is his word didn't mean anything\nWow I'm In the S.

abuser of women who was credibly accused of sexual assaults by women on the record with full facts and the stories ready to go\nMedia didn't want to cover that you see this is where I I I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure we all are on the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here she the narrative of the moments\nIn the left is that oh what Bill Clinton did then he would never be able to do now you see it's different\nBecause of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's ah what will be called the ... what what is left like to call them his his personal failings very common way of saying Bill Clinton being a predator\n... also when I was just you know I'm In on Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all too much much worse stuff in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace or it's something\nThat the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC\nNews anchor that has to be ... who decides to pay that much money it's it's a it's a stunning thing really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they putting these roles is going to get a certain amount of viewership\nBut he seems to get ... they excused from being a part of the country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I wanted me to Hillary just was finally told you don't get out of security clearance anymore for cereal and flagrant violations of national\nSecurity protocols for anybody who has a clearance she was just told that now she still hasn't raised show has been achieved even a a modicum of honesty you could say the bar from Obama not a smidgen smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar\nAnd she knows that she well she's still think that she has a a political future and it would\nBe a problem for her the left has gone so all in on this whole\nMe too movement they've made this such a a prominent part of what the left and for now it's the ... movement of the moment right we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different a political\n... revolutionary leftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it\nBut in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring\nBack on them like they don't want to score and their own goals here with me too movement and that DNA blurs and I've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like Harvey Weinstein ... the people men and women around someone like\nA Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole process of ... they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did she stand by her man of course as we know for the most\nObvious and a self interested political reasons imaginable\nBushy went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed I was wondering respond well to the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did did the women that were completely attack\nVerbally and the media down to their very character they\nWere all considered to be fighters for the cause at the time\nAnd there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was\nEssential in her husband's not just denials but continued flagrant violations of the public trust in ... I mean Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks rape not just you know ... and I really don't like and this happens you know this usage of\nThe term sexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual assault and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton on the other\nNo Clarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of saying some inappropriate stuff in the office\nI mean a worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know not that offered this going to be professional consequences that if he did it I Would think he did it Bill Clinton could have spent decades in prison for what he did the allegations against Bill Clinton were of of rape by force and that's\nThat's going to send you to prison for very long time in your life is essentially over\nAnd he went on to be the president I states for eight years so yes you mean Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any of this she lies now with such fluidity and so shameless like I Would tell you all if you if you want to have a a quick and fun read go back and read Christopher Hitchens\nNo one left to lie to [noise] Hitchens was one of these he was a leftist in the nineties and was still a really is a socialist kind of a reform socialist all the way till the very end is clearly an atheist [noise] but he was somebody who just couldn't stomach the lives of the Clintons and the big lives I mean the very obvious\nIn your face self interested lying up the Clintons and he wrote a book called no one left ally do and he just goes through how the Clintons would you lie about stuff [noise]\nMaybe\nDot com friends remember that name visiting new social media site where you\nCan toast you can write you can follow me you can follow me ...\nExchange information do whatever you can do on your run of the mill social media site they said they'd be dot com does not have any of the left wing conversational how nonsense going on okay there's no bias\nThere is no effort to try and steer the conversation one direction if you are sick of shadow banning if you're sick of things not popping off\nIn your feet on Facebook or wherever you want to try sniffy dot com it's also flies by the way we're conservatives can have a real voice and grow their movement and not have to worry about getting\nBy the left wing administrators Snoopy dot com that's S.

October twelfth the correction posted October fourteen here's the NBC News correction and earlier tweet missed identified the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio\nIt was general Ulysses Grant not Robert elite and attached video clip lack the full context for Trump's remark years the full clip\nNow this is where you have to start playing the game probability\nIs it likely\nThat all of these major media corrections could be due to good faith error in covering the president\nOr is it more likely that what we see happening here is a trumped arrangements syndrome as it plays out in the media in front of all of us all the time which of those things is the more likely scenario I mean I I think you really do have to ask the question and the answer is obvious\nThe press is dare I say on a jihad\nAgainst the president United States\nThey will take any opportunity to try to tear him down\nAnd try to add one more data point into the narrative that he is racist that he's evil that he's a bad guy and this is also compounded by the incentive structure that we have in in the media in general right now\nWhere the initial lie get twenty thousand retreats or you know a hundred thousand retreats and then the correction gets two hundred\nAnd so you get the benefit of of all that traffic of all that attention because now in the digital Arab media you really are measuring it down very precisely how many people read this how many people are going to your site how many people saw this you get all the upside and your audience gets what they want\nAnd then if you have to correct it OK well turns out you know that was amiss fire but your audience is never mad at you for bashing from when the correct I mean this audience would be but\nIf you're NBC if you're MSNBC or CNN if you're any of those networks audience doesn't turn on you for that they understand what you're trying to do they know that you have bigger things\nIn mind they know that you have a you know\nOther things that you're trying to do trying to take down the price of the United states that's going to be a difficult thing difficult things to do and you're going to you're going to have some Mrs if you're doing that right so\nThat's that's just it's just the more the media malpractice that we keep seeing and that's why when the president calls them fake news when he says things like you know they they are fake news and they get so upset if they want him to stop calling them fake news maybe they should stop being fake news\nYou know if they would like to present United States to no longer a push back on them for the obvious partisan smears in their partners and campaigns well then my recommendation to them would be that ah you know he shouldn't\nThey shouldn't act in this way ... you know do you think any of them will will apologize when Beto O'Rourke loses by ten or eleven points which is going to do you think any of the pollsters in any of the people that a month ago are saying it's going to be a really close race with Pedro and Ted Cruz they're going to come out and say may call but I don't think so\n'cause they're they're activists once\nYou understand that their activists then you realize that there's none of this is even a little bit surprising anymore none of this is is a shock and and then you know then you could at least anticipate their next move ... I\nMean the Leslie stall interview uh was was great because first of all I I find her whole\nHer whole demeanor she's just so serious and so much ... toss missed precedent I'm doing this very professional interviewer I mean in a certain point you things yourself can you ask a question like a normal person\nDo you have to do this very affected sixteen minutes\nI'm so in depth here oh I'm just going show in depth on the issue\nI mean I loved it when he said Leslie it's okay in the meantime on the president and you're not they're not used to this\nMost presidents are certainly all Republican presidents stretching back for my whole lifetime\nUh we're in a position where they felt they had to suck up the media maybe you only exception was Reagan but the rest of them felt like they had to suck up to the media or else they're presidency would really suffer because the media had so much power and so much ability to sway public opinion instead Trump is like you know what you think you're going to push me around is going to push back\nAnd he did he did a fantastic job and that Lesley Stahl interview but they still can't leg loving 'em and this media is coming out with everything they've got they lie about him they do publish fake news they say fake news they do all kinds of things\nYeah and the day the president's just got it's got too many skills they can't handle it\nIf you've ever found yourself when sing at that week taste of coffee from one of those ... corporate brands you probably thought\nI Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased training

this Elizabeth Warren DNA fiasco this\nThis self inflicted wound that are that Elizabeth Warren now has and and it reminds me though that that's the last\nReally is increasingly a just just\nLosing his mind I mean there's nothing that you can really\nSay any more of that is an extension of their previous beliefs there's there's nothing that you can really say and think well there's no way they'd ever make that you know ... ... if I'm trying to make a point about the extremes of what they believe in what they think\nThey wouldn't go that far well it it turns out that we're running out of areas where that is still true it it turns out that there are very few things that we can point to\nAnd say oh they would never they would never allow that thing to happen anymore because those examples that we used to use\nAre increasingly now the reality on the left\nRight so this is that this is the perfect example you have the daily call here with a piece that a biological male\nWho identifies or they transgender woman won a woman's world championships cycling event on Sunday\nYou know Rachel McKinnon a professor the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine of age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who is the first transgender woman world champion ever and we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate this\nThis is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory\nA victory for whom I bet you for transgender rights certainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand this but the reason we have sex segregated sports\nIs because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster than women as a function of hormones and genetics\nThat's just that's the truth I mean I I used to occasionally\nWith some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in college and then I could tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights in transgender raise them as something that must be celebrated remember I told you the the way that the progressive\nApproach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant and then it's you know be inclusive and then it's\nCelebrate it and then it's you know\nExcept except this or else which is basically a version celebrated but they they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing and and then you have\nTo you know later you off from it and then it'll be told the celebrated that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their\nBefore but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago that we would see pieces about how men could compete in female sporting events because they say they're transgender and that would be considered fair somehow on the left you'd say buck that's just crazy and I would say well yes it's crazy but now it's true\nNow it's happening a this that's why these here you have this is the ... this was the women's world championships women's world championships and uh you have your men competing in these events now\nThen the whole notion that we have to say biological mail I\nWould note is a misnomer because\nMale is a function of biology as his female we can pretend to these things are separate we can pretend that they're distinct but we're just only fooling ourselves\nAnd and it can't be a shock to anybody that are on a day or it it
