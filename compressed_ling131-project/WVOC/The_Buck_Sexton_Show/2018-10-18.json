[noise]\nReally counting on the great American I Want to share with you some of the headlines from the mainstream media by Elizabeth Warren good friend a rich Samantha's Elizabeth Warren\nABC News said this on Monday and Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry how 'bout that headline about the peace supposedly objective independent the AP quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage\nAbout CNN you'll love this one this is as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests was strong evidence of Native American ancestry BBC\nElizabeth Warren DNA tests fine strong evidence of Native American blood\nThat strong evidence amounts to something less than point one percent in reality she is less Native American blood then the typical so called white American has Native American blood it's unbelievable and uh about\nThe Daily Beast on Monday quote breaking news Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test yes she is Native American\nHow 'bout that Boston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing that this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as a minority to make money\nAnd so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the progressive tribe if you're part of the group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter We're not paying you if you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admit in the presidency\nUsing drugs committing felonies it's no big story at all but if you're outside the group and your name is Brett Kavanaugh and when you were Fifteen Years old you drink beer\nOr had some posting in your your book my God that's a big story\nSo Clinton in office as president drugs no problem Brett Kavanaugh drink beer you're ... when he was Fifteen major major problems\nAnd so I look at the ... of what's happening now in Turkey with a ... major\nStory trying to find the Trump connection using a club against that good men constantly\nBut for heroes dying been ... with Clinton in charge her personal friend Ambassador Stevens Obama's running for reelection no big deal Americans murdered ... ... no big deal Assad is killed in Turkey Trump and the White House huge deal\nWhich continue with your

plans based upon when he's on the air to make sure I can listen and that's more Colombian\nGod Bless you me too [laughter] hey that Trump interview the president President Trump and you it came across over the phone that he respects you quite a bit it was a great interview\nIn regard to this or a Saudi journalist from the ... post I hear constantly on the media is portrayed as a journalist\nOr from Washington Post inferring that he's in the Merck American citizen and this is just trying to prove that Trump doesn't care about journalists and uh he he kisses up to the Saudis it's these are people\nThat I've been helping us fight terrorists for years under Obama he had written lines and ISIS was a a JV team took a Trump a one year to get rid of ISIS you don't hear about that in the news anymore\nBecause you know I don't know because it doesn't fit how long did Obama deal with ISIS eight years now and Trump got rid of them in one year how big of a story was that\nA just a blip on the

six or red state dot com is pretty good I check I Do seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except what I refer to is that mainstream media where people don't have the ... and ... they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the facts they don't want for conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen ... money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're going to have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings skyrocketing said CBS News if\nGonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively\nModerate to the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars\nBecause you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off in what they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream can't can't say these radio shows and needs TV 'cause they're picking to the choir we need to change minds like kind of starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go there\nYes and and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio but but he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took was Lee stall apart on Sunday I thought it\nWas fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing in his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence\nYou know it's like ... it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show it's like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah\nIt's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics\nI wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I wanted to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four pretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida ain't going anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nYeah I wouldn't put it past him he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a ... by the act stupid you know and this is off the subject but I there are so well irony in ... because there are certain there kissing him going after young prosecutor is is competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nI'll tell I'll tell you what's unfair Chris is when you picture our first lady as a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office\nAnd the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around millennia to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was pictured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office what would the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWell where's the outcry there is none me because the Trump\nIs Mrs Trump ...

man had a lot to the right now\nI'm Sorry what did that come from play one more time job\nThat I tried that and signed on June ... white men out a lot to do right now\nI play the audio for you guys did did they say anything about white men\nNope they did not\nSo what do they do here oh that's right they manufactured a pretext to of course get their audience all oh my gosh you know Trump and racism\nAnd go for the most sensitive ... political topic they possibly could 'cause they know that they're always wants to hear the Trump is a racist they know they want to have an opportunity to bash Trump is a racist\nAnd it just like everything else you know the initial lie gets goes viral the old sorry we made that up nobody pays any attention nobody cares\nIt's a disgrace it is a disgrace\n[noise] speaking of what they're willing to do to stop trauma treasury treasury official has been charged with leaking sensitive bank information to\nA reporter oh that's right\nThen employee at treasury financial crimes enforcement network was arrested and charged with disclosing banks suspicious activity reports tied to who wants to guess what investigation who wants to guess the Russia investigation what a shock\nSo here's somebody who is a government employee\nWho thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up somebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one a and released this information to it is believed buzzfeed news\nAnd bus be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nI'm so quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards alleged that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles\nIn twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador in Washington a unit or ... holdings a Russian company entangled in a money laundering case\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay it is a budget isn't identify the charges is Jason Leopold who was listed as an author on all twelve articles sided in the complaint\nSo here is a woman who is taking\nFinancial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes did you say is he's a suspicious activity reports and this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean the kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential\nProtected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this\nSo and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing it means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who forty year old woman\nThought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her life along with it because it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it ... to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone\nWho was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff since then reports for our own on anybody this isn't even intelligence World Cup is are there can be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe you ought to banks sale\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed\nBy this so you have to wonder how many other\nFederal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration was there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that\nTied to Trump was just people around him\nUnderstand this though it sends a message sense it very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump you could be the subject of this kind of\nGovernment activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high level sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying it will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it\nAnd it's not just people that worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing argue to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you be willing to incur in order to continue speaking yeah\nThey are waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of activities oh just this one how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there that's the kind of stuff that makes center Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who leaked the conversation between General Flynn and the ambassador from Russia circa ...\nWho did haven't found that person yet I think it was a very senior Obama administration holdover I've got some guesses horrific abuse of national security power and the destruction of individuals privacy\nThat's how they play the game and they will break the law they will weaponize the government against us and then they'll turn around and say why are you so mean when we win because we have superior arguments\n'cause we're right next to cry and it could wind about this as much as they want [noise]\nBut we're right [noise]\nDon't ever forget that [noise] I've got some thoughts on the show the debacle a washer those who do and what what ... what's the biggest problem

says he'll deliver a report\nTheir word on this one now we've got to verify but this idea that because Trump calls Jim Acosta clown which I Would note that Obama needs to trash Fox News ... network that provided anything of a voice of opposition at all\nObama used the trash Fox News on a on a on a regular basis and no one said anything about it really was the one network that stood against it\nAnd you know that they're saying that because Trump is critical of the press because he expresses his opinion about uh media apparatus that is entirely against it\nBecause of fat I'm\n... years somehow complicit in the murder of his journalist journalists have been oppressed and detained and murdered and foreign countries for as long as they're journalists new\nThis is all the anything bad

racist\nSomewhere it's Trump's fault if whatever may ... dictators desperate stressful\nThey get past the fact that as I said to you yesterday Obama's inaction and did the ring and cowardice as commander in chief contributed to a half a million people just chewed up in the meat grinder that was a Syrian civil war horrific violence\nAnd you know Obama was is nowhere to be seen in terms of leadership nothing if anybody made the situation worse made sure that there were arms that got into the hands of the hottest I mean that's\nWhat happened\nSo we're we're going to hear from the people that are okay with that about how Trump isn't able to do things but it's just so typical isn't it it's just so standard operating procedure from the left and I got I got to ask Dr Gorka today Sebastian Gorka was on was on rising demand got to ask them and say you know hold on a second um\nWhat do you say doctor gee I'd like to um to jeeze good guy ... the people that are always talking about Trump Brazil cozy with dictators you just look at the actions look what he does\nI mean you know Trump has his way of trying to immigration him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state and this whole standard that they set up is nonsense the standard that you know Trump pass to talk or you know super aggressively\nTo tell everybody and he needs to hold to the calendar\nIs just nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with food and then Kim Jong un of these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nOr you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing his prize or because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that\nHey Trump that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the less now is infused with this anti Trump rage\nUh you know they aren't really that cause those anti father should be anti\nTrust anti Trump She did their city while while\nI I Am so sick of all the grandstanding on this on this ... issue and I also think

been a a an effort to engage in\nRigging votes and I think people are now facing felony charges a you know there's this Texas vote rigging scheme is getting just a little bit of coverage and you know here it is\nTo women to Texas women arrested on vote fraud charges in Fort Worth\nThey targeted seniors in the city's north side of this was Star Telegram so the here's what they were doing ... the scam allegedly was it they were targeting older voters and they would they would use that we get their mail ballots and then try to have them sign them or they were trying to\nDo this fraud and mail in ballots All right\nUm the complaints on this is what the the article says you're the complaints focused on mail in ballots which allow people to vote from their homes without any ID or verification of identity a key concern has been how often people may assist others were physically helped by witnessing a was filling out the applications for mail in ballots were the ballots themselves\nSupporters have long said Maryland balloting is crucial for overseas residents in the military and senior citizens critics maintain that such voting is ripe for abuse and raises concerns about vote harvesting in which people could fill out amateur and other people's ballots\nSo here you have these Texas women who were accused of stealing\nOther people's ballots for the Democratic party by the way oh what a shock\nA Ford signatures ballots cheating all this stuff and it's for Democrats so now people are going to prison for voter fraud were always told there is no voter fraud and then I I talk about a case like this and they say oh well okay there's some voter fraud with why do they say there's no voter fraud\nYou know what the thing is they don't know how much voter fraud their aides and they don't want to know\nThirty counts of voter fraud according to a statement from the Texas attorney general's office okay these are people who are trying to cheat and an election then you could say why would they do that some people are just true believers some people are probably getting paid off to do it but at the end of the day they also believe all along that there's almost\nNo chance that they are going to get caught how do you get caught the Democrats\nFight any form of verification any form of election integrity and security at every turn and they say oh it's racist it's racist\nAlways that uh always this notion Democrats push that\nAny hurdle it in the in ... when I heard all any integrity measure right like can you showing ID when you vote shown I didn't cash the check right he showed ID when you wrote anything like that is specifically to target minorities targets everybody it's generally applicable because of the history of the voting rights act and\nAh the fact that the Democrats still like to pose as the great heroes of the minority underclass in this country that is their position that is there\nThat is what they do um with all of that\nYeah they they don't want any election integrity measures and they want to keep pretending there's no voter fraud even when people go to prison for voter fraud [noise]\nHey it's Jonathan Rush

and I I look I don't want to make predictions that we have great poll numbers we have tremendous turnout at these rallies thousands and thousands of people more than we can hold this enthusiasm like we had\nYou know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening\nI think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm the blue wave [laughter] but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough he uh\nHe is I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close is going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think of that same interview that that is really got me a concerned\nAnd it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nStation or anything in this country and say oh this guy but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell I think is the fed because the fed is raising rate is just too fast and it's independent so I don't think\nToo um [laughter] I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last ... numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward or this is going to be an issue and I say this there were people that writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like this time is\nA this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around we're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached the point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough\nI'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be\nSome rough water and that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now\nThan when we were at the time of the crisis in many ways and you know deeper and deeper in debt we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now it would be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do\nEconomic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your chew John and uh all these other groups out there these far left\nWackos are considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all of its rhetoric but they like that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional and\nWilling to take action about all this and with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis gave all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt start to crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy\nOf a ... of his boss\nI guess it was born Michael's but it might have been somebody else screams very drawn quitting I'm Out here a little thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am I don't I don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and falling thought and then he figured he figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I pretended like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot to melt out or just chose to ignore the whole thing but they they wanted him there and he showed up and everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what Elizabeth Warren think she's going to do when it comes running for the presidency I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing didn't happen let's just get\nPast the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show I'm fat is not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is a descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan you see with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fine\nI mean the best is it actually to you know I Know people are going to get married for this one I think you gotta figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a landing in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those\nAre two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast of I Know it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies does very well done was the first animated film ever nominate for us to get back and talk back to the center of the real Pocahontas\nSo there you have it ah what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say um you are not allowed to make the cuisine\nOf another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture borrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time in fact\nIf you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lotta stuff\nSome of you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a\n... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very wide speed northern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native Americans specifically for the benefits they're off but also\nRelated to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cook book called powwow chow and stole a recipe from my real French chef\nAnd called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be an expert in the United states by the way\nYou know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know there's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding of it and say you know what that person may be crossed the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it or being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I\nThat story for you yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really their parents were\nOr you know that that the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for was warned about a maybe eight nine ten generation back\nNative American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy\nThat's pretty well but cultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again was it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we just get some normal people involved oh\nHulu and something about this Halloween you don't wear a costume what's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever okay so now that means no no no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just want to read or what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white\nFor a Halloween then so is it really just white people that are allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing\nBut I don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's write off for you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a under represented in discriminated minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power supposedly appropriation is stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did is not cultural appropriation\n[noise] there is no such thing he does not exist even for ... [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd as simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title locked found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home was equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity bear on it helping to shut it down their arms title may already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free titles scared and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title walked dot com\nAnd\nTrafficking weather reports morning's news radio five six\nRadio laughs [noise]\nWaiting for a report I'm Lisa ... Fox News secretary's day my palm pale back from Saudi Arabia and turkey where he met with leaders to discuss the disappearance of journalist Jamal cause show gay\nMaybe that's the really the plant that's what they think that's where the aid of the Democrat Party is right now and I I Believe that is true you know Nancy Pelosi who is\nJust such a such a Charlotte's him you know what is Nancy Pelosi sample she uses an incredibly rich courtesy of her husband are disconnected from normal people shelf involved political power broker that's what she really is\nHelping people care about people care is one that people do see what do you think\nAbout it or what what can you point you oh or or great achievement was ramming through Obamacare that's that's fantastic talked to somebody who has to deal with Obamacare now or lost their health care plan and tell them how great Nancy Pelosi is I think you'll you'll hear some four letter words\nThis is now\nWhere it where it's all gone this this this is the reality of trying to deal with them um and by the way ... essentially endorsing bitch anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\nAnyway they\nI guess they\nHave to\nGet on\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you out from a left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big right\nDo whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what below sees views on this do whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans win\nAnd then the same time she was saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me of what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is after all of that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich listing fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees\nWith us ideologically that's all it was wasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nThat was the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such represents will be hit or no they came within the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves has to come also if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did to him gloves off I'm Sorry I mean goes off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just\nThere's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of because remember they didn't just want to destroy capitals character they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she she maybe go to the police\nThey wanted him in

failings\nThis notion that there is one gender that is above and beyond reproach he's insanity\nBut that is what the radical feminist on the left seem to suggest they also seem to believe that sexual agency in central decision making is\nThis very murky area where you know if two people are drunk and they can central intercourse but then later the woman decides that she did not think that that was

maybe it's destructive maybe nobody should buy into this notion of the left just being believed\nBut we haven't yet gotten there as a society we still have these elements that push this notion that
