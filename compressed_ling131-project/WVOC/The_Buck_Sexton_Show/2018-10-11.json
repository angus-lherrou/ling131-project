studies is if it doesn't make common sense I tend to not believe it\n[laughter] if it cuts against the grain of what I mean if I see a study and I said well that can't be true that makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know in my life and everyone that I've ever talked to a informed me that that is a a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I just regard this study\nThis one though I find to be fascinating and I think that it makes sense but what I'd like you to tell me is why why do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver Mayo politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turn the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says this skewed article from study finds a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males and survey fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers in the Steven's Institute of technology and I won't get bogged down in a lot of the various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find those to be a sort of the most important part\nOr when it breaks it down between a Republicans and Democrats\nOr this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician male Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way\nRepublican men and women\nAre fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it it's it I'd have to flip a coin between two Republican candidates and one's a man and one's a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I'd I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think\nIt makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters for the conservative cause\nHave been women\nI'm just more impressed by them and I think they're used to taking the golf a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better\nI think men are are are are are too easily cowed by the media they they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a oh don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\n[noise] but women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they heard it all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way

me please I've given\nBirth\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating\nThat when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference which truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha\nBecause I Want to show how woke I Am I'm I'm I'm more feminist than Alan Alda just wait ... you betcha\nI think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes uh they they want to show women how incredibly wonderful\nThey are looking hardly ... I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified that very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right cause he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal causes in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets to where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for a while then you get a free pass up to a certain point\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of a lot to say and and where they are pro

trying to fire up the base trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word\nMaybe they actually do believe this stuff or at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues to being dangerous\nOne thing to say the Democrats are ignorant of history and refused to admit or allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that you can't even have a conversation with them any more about this\nThey're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry and they are being encouraged by their most prominent members to\nTake this out on you\nI I've been asked the question is I said what do you do when someone says oh you're a Republican you must be a Nazi the answer is not oh try to convince them you're not announcing the answers get away from them\nWe are now entering a phase in political discourse where for reasons of self preservation and safety I Would tell you\nDon't engage with these people don't don't talk to them and probably because you just don't know you just don't know it's definitely going to be ugly or going to say terrible things do you can handle the harsh words I Know but\nIt's a very small margin of error between someone getting up in your face because they don't like your politics and screaming at you in front of your wife or your husband or whomever\nAnd all of a sudden a scuffle breaks out and now there's real violence\nAnd not only has to happen once before then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics the impulse to become violent is even more apparent right the impulse to take this to a level of\nHitting people attacking kicking people and perhaps even worse do not forget that the Democrats\nPushed the lies of the black lives matter movement and there were many many lies I heard them I can tell you what they are among them that there was an epidemic of killing of young black men by racist cops who have their job for whom there's no accountability that's a lie\nOut but among among the many lives that were told to this day as well\nIt didn't lead to any violence that the anti cop rhetoric did not lead to violence there there are five dead officers from Dallas tactic in Texas or who clearly their families their departments their friends would disagree with that notion very strongly\nAs well as ... instances of other violence against cops cross gotta chew killed sitting at a patrol car here in New York City where I'm currently doing this show\nLeft wing rhetoric has led to violence including lethal violence where's the correlate we we are so much whereabouts do you think are talking about Charlottesville\nAnd we will continue to hear about a casualty at Charlottesville whenever this conversation about political violence but yet they are so slow to bring up the many many more casualties\nThat have been caused by political rhetoric from the other side\nBecause ultimately they can't win these arguments that they're having with us their arguments are not prevailing in the quarter phobic opinion their arguments about cabin or did not prevail\nAnd they are frustrated they are angry and when people become frustrated and angry but also think that they are righteous in that anger they can become dangerous\nTake senator pause warning to heart\nIf this town does not change if there is not a willingness among those and media say mob violence mob destruction mob

to ... wait it out but obviously if you're told to go go intend to Georgia right now\nAre back to our our political discussion though\nThe\nParsing of language is always a tell from the left\nWhether we're talking about immigration when they use terms like oh on documented immigrant they'll talk about an undocumented every well why can't we just say illegal alien that's the legal term\nWhy do you insist on trying to change the words that we use here and of course change them two words that have some political political connotation right that that automatically skew the debate one side of the other but it is a new thing to have people claim that a group\nOf those who are trying to destroy property or or or threatening people and acting in a way that is that his menacing and that it's dangerous cannot be referred to as a mob if it's because they like really really don't like Kavanaugh like then it's a different thing\nI I didn't know that we would get to this place as quickly as ... but but sure enough here we are where we can't even agree any more on what on what a mob is\nWe can agree anymore that civility is even a baseline for political discourse that there's there's no need any more to expect\nThat one side will be civil to the other because it's really just all about winning all cost Democrats take these as the lessons from their losses the worst possible lessons instead of saying maybe we should\nStop being a party that's driven by the agenda of you know Nancy Pelosi Planned Parenthood and code\nBank maybe\nWe should try to appeal to Americans and do things that would actually benefit this country instead of constantly finding ways to divide and make things\nMore acrimonious more typical\nNastier and as I say more dangerous [noise]\nBut I I Want to tackle this question with you momentarily what is a mob and why does the left have such a problem with calling a mob what it is that's coming up [noise]\n\n[laughter] Wednesday October then what's new today on the free our radio I talked\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the scary mood [laughter] our ... has ... with labor is why we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer jak\nJoe Rogan experience all your music while you're fevers seizures\nAmerica bug sex is that\nI'm waiting for liberals and you know intellectually honest liberal to admit that when you were rats Ted Cruz at a restaurant that is also mob like behavior why is it that I'm willing to concede that Donald Trump is a bad person and that that's my behavior but I never hear liberals come on or ...\nI don't want to say that not to say that that\nKind of behavior following senator is there any other like that official into a restaurant and now with our family\nI don't agree on that I didn't I I\nI don't know like I I Know you got that show that they were or as much as\nWe saw okay I've got to get to the break I Will answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not my rights people who are on it and they're angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy ... there were no matter\nBefore you jump into\nOkay\nHe just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled he's a he's a never Trump conservative for never Trump Republican or whatever and his\nJob he the guy I Know because they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job is just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lives on that CNN\nPanel including the host for lips and one due to the\n... lab ballads they bad boy he's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say I don't see it but they act like it's now it's a question of the number one it may not be ... what do you mean it's a mob\nWhen you've got a big mess up when you've got more than three people who are together screaming in your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife because they don't like her politics don't like your political party that's getting in the ... when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that were there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lips and they don't want the lives that feel like anyone sending me about the really devoted lips\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean\nThat they despise anti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who don't necessarily agree with ... methods but they agree with the message and they know that the audience the CNN audience\nDoes not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much of what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you know what I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these\nIncidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri later these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind and they were\nBurning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analysts later on doing what well is mostly peaceful protest it was mostly peaceful protests\n... mostly peaceful protest what is it even made it can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten and there was\nIs that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to the network standards that that's acceptable I how how that how it is allowed to happen\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there is a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago it was a sports caster\nAnd she said something about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female Oregon that has called by some uh boobs and it was a big\nLike oh my gosh you can't say that on CNN excuse me or this is like when she was all over and it was a big problem\nBut then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very racially\nInflammatory language being used in and people laughing and and mocking Tanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on him\nBut I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time as they are grasping\nFor reasons are grasping for for ways to justify or their intolerance of other ideas the the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies\nEither we we have so few celebrities\nOn the right that speak are so few soldiers alright period and we have so few people that come out and and a spouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land\nSays anything about being pro Trump H there's this mob ... yes there is that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately it's one thing if they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you look every idiot\nCelebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney name one Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these ... these people were\nAll just absolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin and it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a ... ... all of them are on this one side and any of that and all the music\nArtists to this is always the big joke with whenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist and the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artists I don't know\nUh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and roll I don't know there's some great some great country anthems but I still remember out there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone's who's your favorite country artist John I'd ... I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just because he's the only one I think of off the top of my head no no she Tommy is Garth Brooks now come on anyway\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Kanye is out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah I looked I asked them Baldwin Nick\nSearcy a James Woods used Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there are some conservatives out there for sure\nBut we have one high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult it look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big ... fan or is it ... or you see John that we call and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right yeah that's right I work I mean technically I work for her media so I feel like I Need to\nKnow more about the music industry lingo\nShow but but they're they're piling on him and why was because they resent any loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber of fact in love when it comes to any cultural\nA music\nHollywood figure ... they they cannot abide it they cannot deal with it and I mean I Can't deal with them like they cannot psychologically process it it concerns them it worries them they don't they don't know what they would do they don't know how they would handle it\nIf they didn't have all the celebrities that they know saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip um and uh that's that's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this by the way um I Would just note that the\nSwitching gears or for a moment we have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold on to say here here's what we've got on this so far\nBiggest concern is everybody that that if the people they just chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible storm [noise] a hundred and fifty miles an hour ... twelve inches of rain sit for the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether it's six feet or fourteen feet is all deadly\nAnd I'm very concerned that people are not taking any consideration so we are ready to respond if we can't help anybody now that chose not to evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves or we have nice ten thousand or people that are\nAlready free physicians that gets the power back on ...\nI Am scared to death to people that chose not to go back in fact the way this is they just say her when a storm and\nThat's the that's Governor Scott and Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thoughts and prayers everybody's affected I Know we've got a lot of great listeners lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down and and and it said is is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people write him because he visited the hurricane before this there was a lot of oh this is going to be a huge and we\nI mean I remember seeing it way out in the Atlantic I'm like that you know that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken\nOn that notion yeah now there's one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right I mean it's coming up to a point where if they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I've been say usually somebody usually from the Atlantic Gen right a batter's the the east coast of the four oh well\nI Hope everyone is All right I I'm ... I'm hearing that there's been a lot of a lot of people decided not to evacuated\nAnd we were just like I said doesn't preserve it would have more coming up here in ... seconds on the uh continued fallout from Kavanaugh\nLeft is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nBut I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that tall [noise]\nNot just going to city or complain about them complaining about cabinet I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Cavanaugh\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud with a retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nIn his simple because all of whom titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title log found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had of been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host titled the instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down you know what I'm saying don't may already be compromise you know sign up and get a free title scan and report\nIt was a hundred dollar value free at home title luck dot com home title locked dot com\nDo you suffer with pain no\nGain seek your ears into some clarity mark ... news radio five sixty doubling you\n\nSound like ... it's hurricane Michael downgraded to category one storm wind due to eighty five miles per hour the storm came ashore this morning as a category four in the Florida Panhandle rather\nThey don't go after the previous administration right yeah they have a the pardon of Nixon ... for for next year and ... and I don't know I was David Gergen always comes to mind stuff now whatever wherever they have Gergen on CNN it's like you served under Fifteen presidents I was like wow really guy's been alive since like the early Nineteen century\nRich and Reagan for going all the way back to the president Asia administration\nUh so yeah I Know I'm I'm I'm really I'm really out there on this stuff but the point is if if they're going to threaten to take Kavanaugh out with a continued investigation\nRepublican just say okay you you you want to play that game we're going to reopen the Hillary email investigation and we're going to have a different a different attorney general a different department of justice looking at it let's see how that goes there is nothing that stops video Jay from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the\nWeak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people who are operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the right to a speedy investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people actually taking deals meaning they've they've pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial and they can all stop\nBecause they're already\nThe process is the punishment so same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions\nAnd he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse if I used to be of the mind more of a I guess that's a traditionalist William F ... style conserve I used to be the mind if you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we got to have the da da da da de la ... told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's take a look at ah\nAt what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes a decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges let's see what the what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around all Bach no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country\nBack into that mess that mess speaking the FBI by the way you know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to be a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think that given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president down you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these processes work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again and I remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party this this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government for partisan purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government\nIs full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\nTeam it is an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know your opinion matters to that's why I Want to tell you

people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on and we've got someone who can answer this question force over Roy is with us now is the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have him a buck\nSo a ... first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house and the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data\nTo suggest that health care right now is motive motivating people to turn out ah for November having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not they take the Senate they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever at the midterms are going to be over you know this book to your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nTwenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge truck and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going out there who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is she's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for ... between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election whereas the left positioning itself to Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nHere one of the things book that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit\nWhich aims to overturn Obamacare be out by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision in Obamacare and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance period because it creates a theme division\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these rape is a lot of talk about pre existing conditions in when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party's official ... official position on health care once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident that\nI'm certain of it it's just like repealed her place for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections and the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer\nYou're not going to win at all you're going to have a primary challenge to every Democrat\nFeels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen they use philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to\nThey're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to find more over each other to talk about how close angle pair there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that oh you you know over ... bit of all this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections are of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion of the country back in the early days the Obama administration\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist or something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle\nThat's the Reverend Al Sharpton who some all remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by one or Brawley who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case settled this she than\nA centrally refused to pay and it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to wander Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people saying\nOh are you blaming the victim well the court blame the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut ... let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up and gave a speech what was it earlier in a week mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this they\nWon't claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today Democrat Bloomberg\nWas Democrat he was an independent member memory when he used to do those those are those speeches about the snow\nAnd then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless bad and you all you do as little Bloomberg\nEspanol ... I I\nThat was great that was great those are simpler times producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know that uh you know the snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only\nA scene the Blasio common I Know we we didn't know what we had you see the Blasio are read by the way he says the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA ... New York city hit somebody corrupt bill was talking to housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean the work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion it because you like that Jim in Brooklyn\nBut this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess\nFor our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lot of stretching it a lot of lip tickle and you know ... when somebody comes up to him in the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a ... system the man anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's gonna run it's Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty raise\nIt stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nLarge number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you have a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons\nAnd people say it's racist interesting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall on the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped flash\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it looks bad on them and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crime and continued downward trajectory on crime but\nThat reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in in the in the final\nStages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening and the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is a conservative along did say if you get to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of a back road on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk in Chicago\nNobody has any ideas for how to make Chicago a less\nCrime ridden place I mean that's the number of shootings people think of ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weakens with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it's an elope it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing any given year that's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lives and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nAll year from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across\nAll ah all all cultures and all ethnic backgrounds so you can have the structural conversation\nAbout why there's balance the place or Chicago or you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's racist and at the end of day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being ... and they're protecting the civil rights of minorities but you're just getting out of having more people getting shot\nAnd they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton\nHe's running around and demagogue ing well this sharp as what it does struggling runs around and and demagogues on things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away\nYou know liberals would prefer to call Republicans racist and Sharpton to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was the there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a numbers ... numbers based policing a concert that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling than shrieking or that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violence situation under control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise]\nGlobal verification network is

here that you hear that producer John ... and you know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as we get closer\nIt gets more realistic so the pollsters don't look like fools and they're\nGoing to win the same thing over as was two years ago\nI I certainly hope so because if nothing else just dealing with the liberal reaction to having Trump\nWith a majority in the house and the Senate and going for that's going to be amazing\nWhat ... what do they tell themselves what do they tell themselves then but what do they say\nIf Trump is the president for two years and he and
