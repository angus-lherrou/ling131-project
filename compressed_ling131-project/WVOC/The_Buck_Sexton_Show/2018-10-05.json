of uh Judaism is a good thing for this country in a good thing for the world where do you say\nIt couldn't be better state and I mean we as I mentioned injury to reiterate what I said before\nWe we stand then would fight to the death to protect the rights\nOf liberty for everyone not just ourselves that's not a self interest thing it is what is it we blame from the bottom our hearts that everyone ought to be free everyone is banned in God's image everyone has an alien I'm All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do Dale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward a morality and toward God\nAnd we ... we share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our entire a constitutional framework is based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even comes close to the principles that under this\nA constitutional republic there were some great empires but they were empires America's not even an empire and asked if the most powerful nation and the history of the world it could have dominated and taking over the world but it has been benign is\nBeing selfless and not sell for his work is looked at its own self interest but it it's not sought to conquer other nations and exploit other nations contrary to the left\nA history revision has on a in every respect most both ... or a our religious principle or or what stand behind the things that make this country great\nAnd tell you something go and I'd been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian um you write beautifully you're right in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down\nOr you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that uh and uh and and you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing\nAnd uh and you raised a point earlier or when we were talking a and the first segment and that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation like people need to understand that the men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth would the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't establish a religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion\nSo in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that affected these faiths and so well people may say well I'm an atheist well I I you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I ... and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men of faiths were they not\nYes and and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people wanted the rock that because it has any interest of the secularists to uh Shay to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation\nOr back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they start what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to is something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendency the left\nAs Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation in the nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this\n\n\n\n\nAnd there's

visit to primary and white hats and since then I've been researching\nAnd I've been able to come up with I have original documents and things that they use to try to raise money during the civil war some money with tight there's\nConnections to George Washington there's also on a connection to Abraham Lincoln but they wanted a representation of that an average ladies Harley ... every school African library on and I I I feel like I I Want to share that with people and it's just it's\nI mean while you just did with millions of people and I my and I might add I'm this idea of separation of church and state none of us favor a a theocracy so that's not what we're talking about but the\nBut the expulsion of faith from the public square there was never the intent of the framers of the constitution as a matter of fact many states did uh promote various religions again not for me a theocratic a dictatorial point of view\nBut just from a public policy point of view and so we reached a point as a result of a case called ... or under an FDR Supreme Court\nWhere you had a gentleman by the name of Hugo Black and Hugo Black or was the first nominee a FDR made to the Supreme Court and he was an Alabama and he was an old time Alabama segregationist and he\nYeah he was the lawyer for the clan for two years as I've explained before\nAnd he got involved in that decision and the ricin which started the uh the the process for unraveling American history in the public square in terms of face and so forth and [noise]\nUh it's very interesting because uh even though he was on the right side of a particular decision he influenced the decision in the ... case to the point she was anti Catholic and the school buses were picking up a little Catholic kids on the way and the debate debate over whether you\nCould use public funds that way anyway I've talked about it in the years past maybe I'll talk about it in the near future to anyway I Do appreciate your call ladies and gentlemen we

lawyers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we have to wait we'll get to the Russian military uh attack on American spies that we

Russians right right and not doing a thing\nAnd uh we'll also talk about Mike Pence and China that's coming up the bottom and next our with our friend Gordon Chang but I don't want to get\nBack to your books it was just a body a week\nCould go that judge Kavanaugh had to face some ridiculous questions\nFrom Senator Whitehouse a Democrat who was going through judge Kavanaugh's yearbook dream members some of the ridiculous moments one of them surrounded a couple I'm surrounded alcohol but vomiting so first we went with bar fame you're\nWorried about my yearbook that are um website look at the beach week Ralph club ... biggest contributor which is the word Ralph's\nMe and I'm not a that probably ... to ah throwing up on known to have a weak stomach cannot always have in fact the last time I was here you ask me about having catch up on spaghetti I always had a weak stomach\nAnd asked what kept your phone spaghetti let you didn't someone did and and this is well known anyone who's now we're\nAsking about catch up on spaghetti this is what's going on in the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the confirmation but it got weirder than that talking about your books and comments tail off\nAnd [noise]\nThe the word ...\nYou use our yard is already answered all if your lifestyle golf [noise]\nI like that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center or not um what do you watch the tracks one is\nSo cabinet I got heat for that for that answer for confronting White House or his obsession with a teenager who may have consumed enough beer to vomit and then that guy we went from ... to boot thing\nOr what do you have a view I don't know if it's books are being asked how do you pronounce or\nOr if or ... or sixteen [noise]\nSo that went on for a while\nAnd and they were obsessed with the F word and I'm sure the senator has never heard the F word in his life said this this whole obsession with your books in high school yearbooks got me thinking\nSo what did I Do I die ... to the high school yearbooks as some of the people on this committee the Democrats on this committee I went and looked at Richard Blumenthal Da Nang deck\nThe guy who has a committed stolen valor in my opinion by claiming he was fighting in Vietnam when he wasn't\nHe uh he did serve this country in the marine corps reserves achieving the rank of sergeant\nNo that's not really achieving there are a lot of sergeants I Know who did work hard\nBut if you're going to college and then you're getting in the military they tend to make you an officer right out of the blocks so ... saying that he was serving in Vietnam then had to come back and make it cheerful apology uh this guy was a child of privilege was in a private school\nAnd are played on the tennis team and was on the swim team and then I started looking at Cory Booker Spartacus Spartacus Booker who was a football player in his school and if you look at the end Cory bookers\nSenior page on on the uh high school yearbook you can see Cory bookers nickname was sugar that's what he was known to the students in his high school sugar\nThat sugar low sugar can we find out what sugar means what does that mean because some people in the eighties referred to cocaine is sugar should we assume that Cory Booker may have been doing drugs because his name was sugar and in his senior year your book quote\nCory Booker has the phrase\nLet's go all the way so what's\nGoing on with Cory Booker what does that mean Cory Booker this is the guy who remember wrote the essay about groping a woman at the age of Fifteen the essay about stealing second amusing air quotes they're so why are we putting the year books of all\nOf the Judiciary Committee people up somewhere why aren't we taking Cory bookers stealing second Cory Booker Spartacus and ask him what does he mean by let's\nGo all the way he was grabbing Fifteen year olds\nAnd emitted to it there's your guy who's admit it there's a guy who corroborate his own damning testimony alright I'm shifting gears sentiment in here you know I Need to tell you about something important as important as the show important to you\nEspecially if you're

know what you're not going to see I Hope you don't see any more of the silliness\nAround judge Kavanaugh's year book\nAnd the focus on things like the devil's triangle we played Senator Whitehouse mocking Kavanaugh\nTalking about a bar fearing booth thing and the devil's triangle which cabinet insisted was drinking game White House told them he thought he was lying to him that he didn't believe it was a drinking game\nThat he thought that was something nefarious hair and if you go to the Urban Dictionary which I advise you do not do it at work and you look up the devil's triangle you will see that it is\nA an some definitions a a ... with two men and one\nWoman but in the era of judge Kavanaugh the devil's triangle was according to some of his classmates who wrote a letter\nI Am in possession of the letter right here that was sent to chairman Grassley right here right here [noise]\nGot it right here deer chairman Grassley and ranking member Feinstein so went to both of them we're classmates have Brent Kavanaugh says from Georgetown Prep a Jesuit high school in Washington DC area\nWe ride to clarify any misunderstanding about the phrase devil's triangle that appeared on our Nineteen eighty three high school yearbook\nIncluding on our individual yearbook pages that phrase was the subject of questioning a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last week and has since been discussed in the media oh has it\nThe devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation on the game quarters and if you remember judge Kavanaugh said it's a drinking game senator\nDo you know quarters and White House like now I don't know anything about that the letter continues when we played devil's triangle for people sat at a table\nOn the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shoes are\nAttempting to bounce a quarter into one of the glasses if the quarter landed in one of the glass is the person at the table using sitting and nearest that glass had to drink the beer\nWe do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us\nUse the phrase devil's triangle and our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity to us it was just a game\nWith glasses and the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know it sincerely Deland see Davis Bernard McCarthy junior Paul Murray and Matthew Quinn\nThese are four classmates so they sent these letters now if you go into the same year book\nAnd you look up a Bernard McCarthy\nIn McCarthy's year book page he also uses the same F F F F F F F that Kavanaugh debt which we know refers to the F word and a friend of theirs who used to quote have a long wind up to it when he would say ...\nAnd uh he references squeaky another one of their friends and he also claims to be the founder of the devil's triangle\nSo uh I just wish somebody in the Senate which said to these idiots you realize how stupid you'll look when you say stuff like that is\nAbsolutely insane that this is getting this much attention and

abortion so that I really do hope it gets through\nI I think it will to thank you very much Nick real quickly got to go to Chuck Chuck I Know I've been ... near I I don't want to hold you over 'cause we have a garden chain joining us do you think shocking for Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nA beliefs and you say if he does saying oh I sure hope you're does\nYeah 'cause if if he doesn't get confirmed you think it's an absolute death knell for the GOP controlling the house and maybe the Senate\nThey're definitely going to lose a lot of shapes if he doesn't get confirmed this gonna look bad for us\nYeah I agree I think we had a to point would be if you can't confirm him\nWhy in the heck with any of us be expected to go out and vote in the midterm elections it just there's no incentive if these guys have no spine and can't stand up for a candidate like this who has been railroaded thank you check appreciate you\nMichel ... for ... and all night and we're going to talk China\nWhat the vice president said and what an expert thinks is going\nOn in the Palmetto State army born and raised in the heart of South Carolina founded on the idea that accompanies principles should be more

tissue donor organ donor dot com and that just from the U.S department of health and human suffering helped me to chase him [noise]\nFirst over the years have you\nBack was you know because when it comes to the fight for so long never stop [noise] well\nIt's not exactly bucks Sexton but it's the godfather Michael Palca sitting in for my friend bucks Sexton tonight I Love this audience and you know today today I was very busy monitoring all the Kavanaugh stuff\nBut uh if you drifted over to C SPAN as geeks like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tank scholars journalists\nAnd local state and federal officials and more civil\nChina has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next meetings going to be with Donald Trump and Kim Jong Owen\nAnd this part of the world is kind of important\nAnd meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and moving and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it a Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us today\nHow are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population\nAre resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense a not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them\nBut I think China is starting to get to be a a little bolder why why suddenly now are they coming within forty five yards of our naval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidents\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters\nThe Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that that may be released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration were now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing it's Soviet restrictions working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that in vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to people you can find it it's on line and you can do something is geek is going to C SPAN\nAnd watch it which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations uh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions\nAnd I I think he is a a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that that speech to me was welcome now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nThis a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states\nAnd so what they're doing right now is trying to huffing and puffing and bluffs um the American public and to caving\nYou're probably paying too much\n... eight

to my friend\nHey good to talk to yeah\nSure what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I see myself I think the reason why North Korea is trying to stall are now and some of the other issues that we are going on is because they're all just she after these midterms\nIf ... going to get impeached or add more problems because if that happens then they're in the clear\nThere they're fine we will find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they're hoping for\n... you're getting her feet and waiting to see what happens in our media plays into that too because they keep promote all\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are crossing at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get 'em out and I say you realize that meets president pants will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who are\nSticking it to America way to use the word president pants would\nDo and they were going to get him to ... we got a plan for him to so I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo ah I I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking\nAnd then the the er the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep in mind that gym but
