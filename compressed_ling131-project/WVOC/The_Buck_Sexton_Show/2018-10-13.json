second week of tornado weather [noise]\nIs Florida's governor Rick Scott who is term\nLimited and actually a running against Bill Nelson for the United States Senate one of the\nMost important races in the country because Rick has a chance say the Republican pickup Bill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen points and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate ... even ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way ah I'm Brian mud informed more clip and by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be\nVirtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you are what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even has some of those images in your head\nIn one of the things that I ended up noticing when we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground\nZero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nIs you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them or how good are again be about almost anything but the wind just as you saw with Florence and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage in death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when\nNow Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the ... tornado scale right\nTops Hussein wins at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I think I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma\nI hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other co some south eastern Florida um I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were without power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach use all the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we are talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that it was kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be on any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened in Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures of Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped out nothing but to bring you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that all those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two\nBack and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three well before the standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nWhen you get a new car you\nAnd you see two gas stations in one feels gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to a met his share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do with that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and he has people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why managed care is so popular go to ... dot\nCom or called eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight

[noise]\nIt\nWas when he was\nAbout as big as we've ever seen\nIn history we've never had anything like this\nIs actually pretty close pretty close [noise]\nSo you might hear quite a bit about where Michael ranked historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear the top five ... not quite in terms of recorded hurricanes in us history\nBut by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that ... we tracked since Eighteen fifty one but they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history it was a name to it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in with tops who said wins a lamp all hundred and eighty five miles per hour the second one\nHurricane care Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nDid he have a two way die for the third strongest hurricane at the time of land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two and one sixty five as well be fifth strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall recorded us history what's called the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight that's another one deals with Lake Okeechobee here in South central Florida if you will under sixty miles an hour tops the same way and so where does Michael Ring\nWith wins at a hundred and fifty five miles per hour at the time of landfall this text strongest hurricane\nAnd recorded us history that big of a deal\nCertainly prayers go out to the folks impacted directed line they're one of the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today Lebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing in particular like in in Florida we do off in a really good job\nOr minimizing debt at the time but the impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will do well theatre in in make mistakes after hurricane\nThey'll end up died that's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're ... you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes it just didn't include step it in water bottle or something with a downed power lines that kind of thing happens in the case of what we are taking a look at though with a with hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks to get out and that we're going to have a a debt told the rise is considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure All right and the end on a lighter note\nI yeah I couldn't help but the but they go actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and it was a when I was doing radio in Savannah\nDuring the Iraq War the folks you saw in a Baghdad or toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we had the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta\nAnd so he's got a big deal in Georgia he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time to anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War and\nI go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West dog\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kinda turned it into a thing and for all for mainly a couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a ... and stuff you know that those are the types of things that I was doing the union in Kanye West was at the forefront of my urbanized education\n[laughter] anyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for sure from the gap and all of a situation through gun yet and the oval office but you know the only thing that's changed in the grand scheme of things not even so much the stock market\nWhich really change is that we're a little more than three weeks away from election day\nAnd Republicans got a chance that only game in the Senate plus to hold the house you got to get out there and you've got to vote [noise]\nDid have a wonderful weekend flipping back next week fry mud and for the great one more glued to it\n\n\nESPN Plus had your college football covered\nHigh orange radio station or below\nAnywhere you go on the eye hard radioactive\nJourney home my lease samurai Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson now in Germany for a medical checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today families folks enjoyed and ... it's\nThat televised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd it turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but I think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just\nIn a sense the last straw\nThat has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass delusion of leftist that are manifesting themselves with these Matt a masters in these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality\nAnd on and the really\nThe lack of ability on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in the air rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize Trump is winning he still winning they haven't\nBeen able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense they haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of twenty Fifth Amendment and all the investigations\nOf its finances I mean the New York times do I think it was a twelve thousand word essay on Trump's taxes stretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in\nThe seventies I think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep into was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this is kind of like the\nScene and John Nash showed that John Nash\nAs in a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on all this stuff all the formulas in the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem Trump maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and\nThey have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they they really going to all of a sudden you know to discover that oh Russia manipulated this election is that going to be the play it might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick that that will work\nWhat do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the\nConstant refrain of Trump is a racist Trump is a is a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these\nThings but what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he was doing a really good shop\nThe economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and this is their life's work has studied is that\nEven though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would've called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying\nThat as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it\nSo what do they tell themselves what did they come away with\nAnd this then brings me to the outrage mobs anti fall and the uh you know\nThe the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes than the these stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers\nWho are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away in a Republican who put up blocks slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later big high five\nBugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs going to have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can just stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals\nFrom doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it\nAnd I think that what set in with many of them is it's not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nIn the last must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we could at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month what does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage annoys an anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know that it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of that nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole call some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nThat they have a successful midterm election I mean I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America period they never\nOr reflective on the situation in an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage mobs or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are\nAn opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump's but that's only part of the story the other part of it is that they are now inflicted with self doubt they won't talk about it they won't share it with you but how could they not be\nThis was the man they said was incapable of leading incapable of running the federal government and capable of being a successful president\nAnd he is blowing away the critics right now\nThat's got to be a strange place for them to be\nThere are obviously not adjusting well to it there have been sore losers from the start but now I I think that Trump is living rent free in their heads in a way that it it's just going to get worse for them and I don't know where it goes but if they if\nThey don't take at least the house and I'm ... I'm telling you that because of what I was Cavanaugh I'm starting to feel like maybe we could pull out of surprise or eat in the you know the pollsters over at a you know five twenty five thirty eight or whatever it's called now they're saying to think about twenty five or thirty percent chance that Republicans hold out\nThat's not enough and I think it's a little higher than that too but we shall see aid for for a nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred book\nWe have a ruckus show here in the freedom I worry about my my buddy ... to ... to talk about just what's top of mind

allow things also when I hear from you ate for for nine hundred bucks we'll be right back Rush Limbaugh\n\nHave you ever find yourself when sing at the weak sauce taste of some comic coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brands you probably wish they spent less time on their politics and more\nDoes it become a major diplomatic dispute between turkey which is increasingly trending under air to wants government away from its relationship with the U.S still an ally but it's getting more and more tents with time but this was a major diplomatic spat and sure enough\nThe Trump Administration its diplomats\nWere able to get him out\nAnd he should be home in a in a matter of of ours now so a Trump tweeted out today my thoughts and prayers are with pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home shows you can stop and Germany's you heard there\nSo the dishes yet again what we've been told all along the Trump would not be able to accomplish that he would not be adept in this area which is international affairs you know and people say oh buck it wasn't a ham it was other heat the buck stops with him okay he is\nThe commander in chief he's the president and when things like this happen high level US government negotiations and in this kind of desirable outcome you have to be willing to say okay we we give the president some credit for this one\nUm we get their president credit and then there's also what's been going on race with China here's Larry Kudlow play fourteen\nI just would hope\nWould show greater appreciation\nFor the past [noise]\nThat President Trump has been making\nA with regard to blows markets are with regard to a ... with regard to force transfer of technology there are structural issues technology issues where I get with family jewels there's no reciprocity I'm trading in Paris so there's a whole menu of things\nAnd I hope they get Iran to talk about it perhaps the Chinese will be a little more um cooperative\nAnd with that whole menu of things by the way they put little brings up those have been problems for for decades but other administrations didn't even try to fix those problems other administrations just allow them to continue on why oh we we we can't mess with China\nSomeone give us a reason for that\nWhat's the explanation for why we can't mess with China they're not Texas right don't mess with Texas a ... were suffering in silence was a better option know Trump is taking on that are taking on that whole slew of problems\nAnd could lowest right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that he knows are important without regard to well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back relaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in\nOn the world see knows a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying don't make\nAny decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk well turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could accomplish things in the world stage that the Trump approach on the economy on foreign policy [noise]

collusion nothing to do with working with the Kremlin and these are the kind of people who get caught up in this we've got ... Papadopoulos Alex vendors won\nNone of these people had anything to do with Russia collusion and yet we sit here\nAnd wait for this final report to give us the ... the end state outcome of this ... what a mess what a total mess I mean I can say this to bring us back to what we're discussing earlier in the hour\nUnder any normal circumstances of the American electorate judging this president on the merits of his presidency and therefore the party you leave the Republican Party by how things are going and basing their votes upon that\nBy any objective criteria\nThat we can point to the country is better off now than it was a couple of years ago\nTrump is a more effective commander in chief then Obama was the economy is growing more rapidly and has more more head re more room to grow even further because of what has been done because of the tax cut the deregulation\nAnd yet what has been the focus this whole time they it's not that the Democrats have been making these Ernest appeals about how they would better run the economy all they do is try to tear down they just play the politics of the attack dog all the time\nThey don't offer a creative solutions I don't what they offer you as more constant nonsense about the Mueller probe what they offer is eight eight continued national conversation on whether or not you know there's something in Trump's tax\nAnalysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you had a lot of analysts talking about this one did the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy or all obviously had been in a way by it because they they're saying you know why is the president and detracting away from his great we\nWith Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally attuned to know that you know more Americans saw that clip ... anything else at the end of the day you know if you were to go around\nAnd and ... somebody you know a universal studios like they used to duty on on ... on late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West up in the president's perspective\nHe's using the star power of ... in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a I have a hilarious moment\nIn the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on our fate and they were just saying this was wild and one of the camera guy told me than the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter] that's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet oh what are we expecting tonight at Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the G O P hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage and scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who is running because the people who have actually told me before other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president comes as you get national TV coverage you know when does and that last time\nThat age you know some house candidate in uh Ohio six\nIs going to be getting into ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging in that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea they were he he's been having a saint campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night he's got one tonight he's got one\nTomorrow night he's had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about his record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies that is that is absolutely the case of ... what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policies on for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that anything that we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said uh you know in terms of ... that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nUS President about that right I mean you ask them about their reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I ... a week before you did I think and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the issue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that in the last press briefing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the midterms\nSo for now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general horror with\n... he is is a very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime so\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent being the White House all those are\nThe best part is just being able to see I mean it can be they're up front to get to get yelled at by hitting rock like we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleague we we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked Mr Iraq which I thought it was funny to all of this rock and he said Mitchell rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump should fire just session and he said he should fire all of view before [laughter]\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as a as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um\nYou know act like you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock and beyond that 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid right [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's it's like that's it day to day stuff that you know oh if Jim Brown is here kid rock is here ah you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dream\nWould be able to and then at the other on the other hand you also get to talk to the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nGot to be the most fun president in our history to get to have a conversation with him and I know you were in the ... the over ... recently ... it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as\nTry to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\nYeah he really is a force of nature it and it's like you said your your your your your throat out there and he'll latched on to it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty and other direction and you you try weapon Ninety through a little bit of where you want to go and you just see where to get\nThat that really is exactly like I said\nWe we love the ... it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer\nOut of ... it's hilarious I think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him and said there have you talked to the Saudi about you know the current situation with this is missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yet and [laughter]\nWell you know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going through all of the discussion there is the vote you know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in\nThe ... one for every one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you're the White House correspondent that box accident as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the ... gone to Victor\nOkay I'll read that word is

policy discussion in this country but has to say that you know he's he's crazy what strikes me as a a really under handed a nasty way of of undermining his argument\nBut then when you when you listen to some of these kinds of you said it's not that he's crazy it's that you could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox limited it's that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying when the when I went back and and read the transcript today\nAnd spend a little more time listening to some of the soundbites and when you take away all the\nYou know the the sort of flashing lights pomp and circumstance situation all of this high profile Oval Office meeting here's some of the county actually said play to\n\nAll the data and then going on with the legal or illegal and legal ... we have a right to bear arms\nThe problem is illegal guns he says now you and I both know that that's that is established fact at this point that that is very clear the problem is is illegal guns legal gun owners\nAre actually not just a lesser criminal threat than your average American they also have the effect of reducing crime in neighborhoods for re violent crime you can go read Jon lots more guns less crime for the end up to now says we're all the numbers on that\nUh what's your book plugs to people that are friends of the show but\nThe fact that he said this upsets oh many liberals they hate\nWhen anyone breaks ranks on the issue of guns because guns are such a a simplistic issue for stupid left wing Hollywood social justice warriors to feel like they're really brave and strong on\nAnd they live in this complete echo chamber of everybody knows that guns are so bad everybody wants to get rid of guns because guns kill people and they won't engage anywhere beyond that I mean I tried to talk to a list a mulatto who is of course a meat you leader\nWe taught her out in California and\nUh she said that it's as easy to buy an air Fifteen and just to buy a cappuccino at Starbucks it's just a lie\nI mean if yeah if you had mandated federal background checks for all purchases and you had to be\nEighteen and you couldn't have a criminal record and you couldn't be a drug user and you couldn't be ever convicted of domestic violence and you couldn't give your cappuccino do anybody else and you couldn't take your cappuccino you know a across state lines and you know you go down this was so yeah\nIt's like buying a cappuccino insofar as it's like buying something but there's a tremendous amount of other stuff that goes into it\nAnd I I Can't tell if it's that she's just not smart enough to know that or she to self righteous and self involved to care\nAnd the end of the law is more effective but you see ... saying the problem is illegal guns that bothers ... what I what I realized more today is that they don't want to ... it's not just at who he is and then he appeared with Trump and that he's just ... high profile\nBlack celebrity that all bothers him shore but beyond that there's the issue of hold on a second he was saying things that upset liberals on policy he was saying things that were a shoot in many ways and that's where you get to oh they just want to shut

hair out\nYep yep\nSo happy learned how to put you know oh a quick question though yeah man I got a quick question for you were talking\nAbout the job in the beginning of the segment last week we had that um Obama clip where he talked about or his or when he was a youth to hell he got in fights and you were mentioning how you know probably didn't happen um who would want an Obama Jeb Bush but\nLike if they stepped into the octagon put on the pads and say that's a really that's a really a tough one yeah I mean I'm I'm into energy jazz and throw it on like you were saying this I I think I think Obama problem I think Obama probably\nTakes them I just think Jeb is just a wimp and like you know Obama's probably got some wire east rang I think about them I I Know everyone's Boeing you right now look I call it like I see it All right I call it like I see it\nI'm trying to think of what would be will be some other fun occupied octagon UFC style match up with various pot well first of all I mean I think he would take like any Democrat oh he'll he'll here with all the the GOP has got a lot more ringers for the octagon in their in their senior government ranks than uh\nYou know the than anywhere else I mean I can tell you this if it were\nIf it were between Biden let's say and Biden McConnell I think would be interesting I probably I think that\nBy ... you know fights a little dirty huh but McConnell also has that you don't remember you ever have like your ... you ever get on the wrong side of your grandpa and I felt like Rand Paul is kind of old but then he actually grab you know like oh my gosh grandpa was old man's right yeah\nI think that ... yeah I agree with that yeah do you have to do the turtles journals are all about surprised yeah snapping turtles look all slow in June to ask a finger that's how McConnell would fight flow and was that he wins re he'd be all methodical and Biden you know\nI think so I think that's a fair point so we should do your own records like it was like so these two politicians kinda got into a fight who who would come out on ... oh you know be a great one cruise in ... oh yeah crews that are worse because\nWe got three ... we got that one a swamp fight club that saluting\nDo you think about this though Cruz took Jimmy Kimmel to school and the basketball court just took him to school\nAnd Kimmo was really ... um a lot and if you see some of the video it was really trying hard and people thought he was going to win crews that you know what Cruz is all about the fundamentals do just like he's all about the constitution when it comes to the law and when it comes to basketball Cruz is all about like boxing out and I bet you in like a wrestling match\nCruise would go with like straight out of the book like double lake takedown armed bar you know half Nelson\nHe probably studies all the maneuvers yeah\nYou know whereas beta unless unless he can you know knocked back a six pack and get into a car beforehand I don't think he's too dangerous right oh yeah All right let me go I think the only way that\nGo ... when he got to say one thing I think we learned\nFrom the second is that uh whether it's in the arena of ideas are actually in the arena in a ring services will always come out on top\nI think that's it I think that's a perfect place for us to leave us because that is that is in fact they

Europe the United kingdom specifically\nA and the Democrats to guard our health or have decided the pizza is the next target at all that uh they uh there was an organization called public health England um it is a sort of help watchdog and regulation or in the United kingdom invasive\nNow said ah the ah pizzas should be kept in the terms in terms of how many calories or should be sold a\nJ getting towards the cheese the toppings\nAll that kind of thing and you gotta be supplies the supermarkets takeaways a you know teach a delivery places like that\nYou would have to ... and they should be cautious and of course unfortunately whenever there was talk of going to be the crisis has pointed at the United states and say we don't want to be like them\nOr are we going to reach a certain way or unless I think it was just going to apply to pizza buckets going to apply to a ... ha\nPortions labeled nine hundred and twenty calories\nIn any take away all should which was kind of restrict a culture that age you and and and so on and so forth [noise] um so it's it's quite a lot of shapes over the last twenty four hours it but unfortunately I'm it's entirely true and which makes us the jail\n... is the pizza and the u._k. anything that anybody really wants to eat it let's be honest I have no idea I'm really asking but\n\nI mean is dominos the best you can get in London do you have some pretty good pizza\n[laughter] your average your average Chicago and New Yorker would not wanting to win by London he um but uh but it's you know it's not a ... you know I I had a pizza in many many times they don't live shows um but it's not just the pizzas\nAbout the laws just a take away food product in the United kingdom is combat right don't ... I mean none of that would come in under nine hundred and twenty calories portion so when you add a lovely garlic sauce and all that stuff on top and the chips on the prize as you say on the side\nI'm so this is really actually going to\nI think hit a lot of people in their pockets quite seriously because they're not actually going to be less well they're gonna have to do is what is double portions\nAre always going to say they they they can't they're not making you have like a friend come with you so you can easily get one slice or one ... I think\nThey might ... we're not far off from having police officers in every ... watching coach you're saying um but yeah I mean realistically speaking there's nothing to stop me going okay I'd like one slice of pizza place\nAnd then going back to the front of a lot of going and I'd like another slice of pizza place I mean nobody's going to enforce that so it's going to be paying double it's going to be you know again this is this just regressive because who is the oldest most of the takeaways is actually working class people\nPeople who work very hard long hours I have time to cook I Am

accusation and\nWell the truth is those accusations are generally anchored by the place the time the reality of whether those people had had any contact were they in the same region within the same city are you know there are there are allegations in their allegations\nYou know if I say that I uh met with somebody who was part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or when but it happened\nThat's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big international conspiracy we met you know next to the Washington Monument and this was the time of day\nBecause by adding those details even if I'm just making that allegation it at least provide the context and it makes it either provable or disapproval theoretically prove or disprove will whereas if it's unmoored by the time or place you can't\nYou can't just prove it that's why the Ford allegations and I wrote I thought was a very disturbed person I mean I think the lousy for probably has had\nAll kinds of terrible things happen to her I think she probably was a is almost certainly was sexually assaulted I just think almost certainly uh she is making up that it was Brett Kavanaugh or at least she's wrong about it being Brett Kavanaugh a which would not be that strange for people with a thirty five year a memory gap\nSo [noise] or thirty five years ago and memory gaps in that show here here we have this the first lady talked about the me too movement and and make sense while talking about the me too movement and then we also have\nWhat does not make

published in the Washington Post and\nThat the Washington Post would publish this I mean they consider themselves a serious newspaper okay they they think of themselves is probably the second most serious newspaper in the country only to the you know only in the the number two slot for the New York times but there are D.C based and so I'm sure they believe that they're even better than the times on a whole bunch of issues anyway\nHer piece is as follows quote same or this is a professor or a college professor right in the Washington Post thanks for not raping us all you good men but it's not enough\nLet me take you a little bit into this piece of my friends quote I yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell not how could you ignore that red light yell this was really yelling this was thirty minutes from the gut yelling\nTriggered by a small thoughtless dismissive annoyed patronizing comments\nReally small a microwave that triggered a hurricane I blew hard

are you are sanctimonious all the time but you really just want to have people treat you better well you know weight which is that\nThis woman went into what I think you can call full on Harvey mode against her husband and I think that's fair to say screaming at him more than she's ever scream before over what she says where they thoughtless comment and she thought she was channeling the anger of all women\nAnd then a whole piece by the way is about how it's not enough to just not attack it's not enough to just treat women well and not be a sexist you have to form a male pro feminist movement vicious classic\nProgressive social justice theory I Would know they say there's about racism to it's not enough to just not be a racist personally you're responsible for historical racism as a white male and therefore you must actively work against it\nOh that means being a progressive doesn't it but I I really tell you to read this piece thank you for not raping us good men but it's\nNot enough
