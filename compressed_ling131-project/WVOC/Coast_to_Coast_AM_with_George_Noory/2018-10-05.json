it's\nBeen a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why now and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have done what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver\nRoom my body\nOn a motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I lay there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my\nLab ... you know now I have to start the legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in Paris which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember that\n[laughter] but I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a kitchen table\nAnd my God and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seed planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness somebody\nOnce you were wrong and I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember in town that they tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to a Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you [noise]\nI was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Paris and township where I had my motor motorcycle accident uh-huh airborne height\nReally yeah well if\nYou told me where cars you must remember this the the street\nOh I don't I doubt who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah with history but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over ...\nI'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes you'll remote dealing now\nYou were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear miss viewing skill new Michigan album\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back your my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you're going to ... just been elected a vice president of a psychological shows you usually get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no\nUm well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history and\nThat was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out you're not ready and I didn't apply for the job\nAt no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is any relationship is only\n... you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery which you'll remember remember the Troy lists and so\nThe beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do the huge through college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yes I'm sure\nRight all the micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a thin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nYou people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think we can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intentions of very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any during the ...

exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know Edgar Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nUsed their descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like quarter law and she knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after death\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love you Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge and jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences we ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays in its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think\nAgain we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of a functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with light and with that intention\nTo manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like\nYou know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nKeeps coming ...
