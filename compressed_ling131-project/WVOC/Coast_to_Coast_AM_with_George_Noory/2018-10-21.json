question was who do you believe to be more honest do or Clinton the answer\nUm Dole over fifty percent Clinton around thirty percent\nSo the people that are saying though is the more honest of the two candidates\nBut then I asked who would you vote for the answer do twenty eight percent Clinton's fifty eight percent\nNow this says something does it not\nAbout the American electorate\nOn the one hand in question one they are asked who is honest\nAnd only a third of the people said President Clinton but then they're asked who are they going to vote for and two thirds of the people just about say President Clinton now in my way of thinking this says more about the people surveyed\nOr if you wish to believe it representative the electorate than it does than it does about the candidates\nAsked a buy Newsweek who is the more negative or nasty Dole gets about two thirds fifty nine percent Clinton eleven percent both of them Thirteen percent\nWho has better character to be

going to happen and mostly if I'm right or wrong I haven't done very well with the stock market so there is no reason to believe this will be accurate but here is my prediction for what it's worth\nBill Clinton is going to be reelected if not in a landslide than by grapes margin\nRepublicans will hold Congress no I'm not sure about this one but I Believe and I will predict the Republicans are going to hold Congress by a very slim margin\nThe Senate will remain safely in the hands of the Republicans are within a seat or two at the most\n\nWithin a year after the election the Clinton Administration is going to in my estimation be buried\nIn scandal so that takes my prediction about a year out from the election I Believe Bill Clinton's going to win Republicans are going to hold on

down that flammable\nWater not good\nI don't know if that's true or not but that's what I heard another thing right here in Portland somebody has come up with the idea because of the drugs and the

folks\nWill lie I I'll tell you why I I think why\nI'm it's probably because of the Fourth Amendment in other words they probably figure constitutionally they can get away with it when it's a minor but goes to ... they probably a cannot get away with it when it's a um somebody who's a ... or you know become Twenty one age of consent\nIs that so that's just a guess okay\nWell it just seemed unfair to me\nOr that they would do it to the young folks and not others because there's a lot of young adult that\nWell I got All right let me try this out on you if they were to test everybody everybody went to get a driver's license how many drivers percentage wise do you think would immediately be off the road\nIt ... percent\n[laughter] oh God to lighten up some of the traffic jams

Mars ABC CBS then\n... and a and B the mhm I I think they have a very big biased I don't know of there's there's all\nKinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh most people and I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on TV\nThat is true and I I think it's a shame [noise]\nWell I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say\nI'm so you think that people are taking their cue from the media is true that more people to not get their news from the

a point\nWhere you know I Would say that what you're raising is good and valid point except for the fact that if you look at the appointments that require congressional approval ones that were made by Clinton and required approval of the Senate or almost inevitably a just like rubber stamps or they were approved\nYes I I realize that I I I Would just uh for some reason with thing to do with it I have a little bit more conservative or a thinking on when when he goes to a point these judges then went to\nWell I Would certainly like to think so but the record would be that he helped confirm

somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want it excuse me what why don't you go out and make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and ... and coming back because they said that the way we learned yes\nYou remember they always say that\nHey that's how we learn yes and yet on the program friday night you and the priest agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that\nOne point I remembered clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate aid to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which\nIs that it we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber ...\nAnd now there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls yeah right so maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist\nOr being in effect out voted by the ... coming along as we don't know a damn thing\nI don't know why I like\nNow when you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's is a guest and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor a new change my mind at all I Do rowing several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I doubt I'm Misha program but I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no oh boy\nWell then you must not catch 'em all well I

the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\nSurprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I I think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want because people could keep messing up their lives\nEach time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better the next time and they never do and then with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see I don't write a well a baby all have them on how 'bout that oh I I I'm going to make sure I never miss your program because I won't know ahead of time you announce it will I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much are\nYou welcome to share a glad you called and uh that was Las Vegas I'm indeed used to the Rockies or on the air hello\nMike in Nashville Hi Mike how you doing fine listen I tried to get through friday when your father Martin on your hands on April to you know a\nHad a couple of questions I wanted to ask him but I Know this had to be popping through your mind did you catch all the parallels I made almost right down to the tea of the things ... and the next three or four years the major teams is already talked about\nStumped me cold man uh\nYou know I'm new to the audience who listens to my show I really didn't even have to say anything new on we'll be we're catching it\nOh golly I mean it was it was right down to the tea but he said one thing that jumped out at me when we started talking about the anti Christ was already is you have to come or may already be here right he'll be the one that will present the problem is to us and then maybe show show the solution that's right and that was that was scary but\nI really enjoyed that interview with him I you know what he did say he would come back any time and I'm Glad he said that I Hope you have you back more often um well I Will\nKen and uh the uh the but but but the parallels there with what I I just can't wait to to look at times comes back after he has spent a month or two with putting all those resources into this next three and a half four\nYears you know well it was so obvious uh the things that just went click click click click not just a games but so many of my other guests yeah yeah and then to have somebody of the uh the church on who I just stopped me cold and I just I thought I don't even need to call attention to this uh they're all getting it\nBut I'll tell you what art and I turned fifty years old I was first and I don't know whether this comes with getting older or what but\nI Know that something has changed in my life just in the last four or five years I think when you get older you get more spiritual ... you get more introspective within you know looking into yourself and I've become aware of a lot of things that are happening around me and around the world\nThat I never have been concerned about before Saturday you know concern myself about a month to put these things together\nNo I hear you on the one years old and I have I'm beginning to awakened to many of the same things or\nIs it uh it is really an adventure and uh I think that uh we might see a wave of more of this but ah if anybody was ever the conduit to bring science to the attention of people I think you're doing a wonderful job of it as a matter of fact about me in a special machine\nLook I got her on the news here already you take care of my friends to

visit coast to coast am dot com to sign up today\nNew view the coast to coast too young [noise] do you still think too that the way things are going up the global elite still want to dominate the planet and that they might succeed\nWell I think they did dominate the planet for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six because the founding fathers decided to form a new form of government one that was based on laws that were turtle certainly right that the players that are funded Hayley Idaho Falls suck up all the people that have ruled\nThere's it's a cool they didn't like that so for two hundred and forty two years they've been trying to get it back and we America has risen to that's the fight that we see going on right now\nDoesn't still feel on a fuel to resolve to you know there's something wrong\nThere's a grand force is out there that need not just once they need to capture the soul of the world but I don't think they're going to when I Do think they're going to win\nSomewhere in time with art bell continues Curtis the Oprah near networks [noise]\n\n\nAll right um since I tell you folks everything\nAnd I try to I'm going to tell you something now because

[noise]\nTo Richard Nixon I don't know what I'm saying is that on a morality level than the American people have decided that Bill Clinton is no angel buddies know Richard Nixon he's polling place in between which is correct that's about right and they decided that that although it's not\n... Richard Nixon and an angel and there's a lot of territory in their\nExactly and they'll Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that is yes\nAnd that's linens and on and on you know if Richard Nixon was zero\nOkay and an angel is a gym where would you say Bill Clinton would be\nI Would put I Would put Bill Clinton ... port more toward the uh the uh you know toward the lack of morality is going to let me let me say this real fast I mean like ... when Reid is real fat the best executives and and a psychologist or\nWait wait a minute I really want to be better off that Charlie Charlie Charlie I Want to be clear on this is ... is easy closer to Richard Nixon or an ...\nIt's probably closer to Richard Nixon ... wrote that the best executive\nTend to be sociopath people with sociopathic personalities\nWho actually are actually be tend to be great to mass murder but they but the thing about it at people who are executives had was to some extent the route with and be heartless and so if you look at some of our best friends they more morality thing they haven't been very good people but they've been very good executive and that's why I think that actually helped Bill Clinton hurt and it helps him\nWho would you like to be smoking cop\nOh what a smoking cup\nWhat does that nicotine policemen\nNo but I think we're going to need those are

trauma into his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the\nStrength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right\nI thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as and they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because\nNow we get into the say on and and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I Am a bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWill outputs are not interested in it but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bats and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in the big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of hurricane Harry's mother intrude into this session and in his mind putting the words forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul was spirit with surviving gap and so is this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't want to say I got a jump into your forgive me Thomas I got to jump in and got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after

coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this\nHe was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the it would only do three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up on us Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe\nThe ... he communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public stance is on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry [noise] um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's just step on the top where we'll be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of make it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand time and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere in trying to disprove the

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing\nBut you know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to build a little lost um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for\nMore than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England came to losing the right one they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in a way to own airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked extremely well\nEspecially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war and now we're there to help out Churchill\nSo we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the British now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who gather\nTogether but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR\nWere working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we want to be from\nShow to answer your question around about fashion um church show like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about rape urge to think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been a strand of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean it was\nLike there's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ...\nReally happy hour it seemed in reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we need it Stalin Stalin didn't need us\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and ... and spelling hit a pack\nWell Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler sleeping under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything\nAbout Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like thirty\nSome odd different drugs so he was such a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd Hillary says well I don't care I Want to go do it\nSo Stalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think teachers Roosevelt still looks pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how are they tried to recruit Hemingway ... ad loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country in the country into this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires\nYou know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and strength boy by stone stone is the puppet master he uh he was this guy what he managed to accomplish\nWith his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the ... revolution\nAnd he ended up they just don't make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's journals are used to call them\nUm red or was it on Conrad index card it was to calm Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his a quote from one of those will I'm rich donors to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after ... death they they called him a you know apparently pusher and all kinds

I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's dollar one of the debt I I think he did not want to want to deliver quality pop like that's just my my take on it\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young uh but just because he you know he surpassed\nThe average lifespan I don't think it was his lowest forty nine back then but I mean George Washington you know live to be in ... I Believe in the seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be um the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff\nAnd you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Would check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport,

days ran they got down nice guy that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I\nYeah I Do actually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the stock market was not as big as it is today\nAnd there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family ah probably it's all money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest\nUm that sort of thing when you have all money I'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you

about Harry who d'nese um how should we just practice I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start\nBecause you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned\nHe really um he um\nWas not just on this side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that young student who had done the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in the abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for\n'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right I'm going\nTo my that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in\nI just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an of vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talk about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\n[noise]
