him better from uh ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and our [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in a league group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I mean I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nOh you're missing missing a terrific how men but you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff a ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like\nIsn't this kind of ... it was reminiscent do me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm a very non scholastic approaches the sciences there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer in cryogenic\n[noise] yeah yeah a lot\nYou know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is\nThe science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime ago and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... one to the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I\nGrew up in east LA with the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really and that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like the ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we'll go with the next

the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break\nWe were talking about that that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting that it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere is an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with\nAll the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow where\nTo find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah and we all know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know\nA billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight are we to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots\nThey'd gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation is crazy is towns words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about feeling a industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he\nRecently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it is inevitable that one day a artificial intelligence robot\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I play in every once in a while you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at about well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo ... I like that the cushy Murphy app yeah eat 'em right because you know what\nThe old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships\nI think our life as we know it is much more fragile and people would like to think it cannot stand all the things we will be throwing added in the future we'll get back to that thought with Michael ... lost to shoot you the numbers coming up and about thirty minutes for you to join the conversation\nAnd then it's open lines for the rest of the night and coast to coast am\nIn for George ...

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or they lost their ability to walk into bed spinal injuries and and that this to them is a dream I mean the I ... just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... their muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of the downside to that other than the military application I guess\nA ... where are you with that one\n[noise] no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's there's actually\nA movement a called the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as they usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's where a ball and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled and and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know\nThese are these are arms that he can move with his thoughts that they're they're wired to his\nMind and I and some fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nIn the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton that I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just it it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race right yeah ... it in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know so oh our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional\nAnd you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism\n... you know I mean that's that's\nHow eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there is\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are uh her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so\nBuying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the showcasing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into the the situation and the husband was cleaning one thing he said there was an intruder and now the man\nWho killed he killed his

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak\nI could pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story\nFrom the husband and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like no they weren't [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time so bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense and just ...\nNow into my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think the way you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the rapid God it's worked out a upon and find it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian\nI'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't want to reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd soul yawn\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYeah [laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and watch it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew that actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey I my question before I'm gonna Stovall and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah or if they do we just lose him and we just lost\nA oh no All right Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh I've been on and kicking machine going on forty five years yes er here and I was a banker do generation had like you know from your guest or when we feel that the shoe will\nBe overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a chair and they identified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you [noise] go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nThe on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now uh\nRestoring people fight with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her fight it they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides they're already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore sight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we'll have to end it with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next done coast to coast am this dizzy and punish\nHave launched

here\nSuddenly the jar bombs on the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance\nCamera with all the jar [noise]\nNot long after that this happened watch the pen cat it's completely still and no one's around when certainly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the video has been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... satisfied with their GM

goes there but that video ... especially ... and the fact that ... what really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in an open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours\n[laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills running with children\n[noise] yes well I'm right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into\nThe are going to be in the

where nothing because they sleep\nRight uh you know we can try to play God but I I I [noise] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that so peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say that and it ... if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were like we did have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know uh other meant if there are other people who have problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test tube babies and I think we're\nWe fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it right\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... he ... her and I'm a revival manner or would it have anything to eat it at that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and as soon as firemen now and furthermore\nIt our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for\nThat is families with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are usable and\nWe don't know even with training we don't know if\nThe supplies what's this ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt or you like to um volunteer myself not to\nA consuming somebody supplies but just chew on my cell and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even\nHis thing then sell an interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in the case or or whatever um\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just wanted because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's this series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and their the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know a ... but uh yeah so we're willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kids are done is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well until ... am done\nRather a I'm happy to have\nA you know I got a kick out of your commercial by ghost in

started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to to share something uh uh about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline or\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science\nOr whether it be a Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink and the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over all three\nOf the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible it and I'm quoting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\nAnd the new this and the new ... the the current estimate yeah I mean\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the current is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods\nThe story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible\nA mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nA historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate and ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for\nDaniel to know\nAs much of the future as he as he did but that that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity you know\nOh I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book\nOr you know and they'll\nA skilled in and you know it's called proof texting and it's a yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamp posts not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just it sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about a true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murders stories there are in the Bible and that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible\nAnd that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is the Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to\nBuild a legacies de do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why\nAre you are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always the ... been the big difference of shooting a bullet\nIn the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter] I'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know

I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years\nI'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right you're on a good one at a wrap it up quickly a lot I could go with you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with a caller\nI'm Talking about the liar along the lines of\nA it your your creative freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or her metabolism or whether it's got him or her so\nThat we really appreciate that freedom that you should stay there for your trip to worship your way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that for\nSure but I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we have a responsibility not your health individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is\nA I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about it the border that makes us a country that's just not true you know it's at the border that makes me in Arizona and or write or soon to be a a a cans and it's like we didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to we aren't philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think\nThat's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting part in the other but gosh darn it that was great thank\nYou so much for jumping in an open lines and a look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nLet them make that decision I Want to think a George ...

book that I think you will love hear the story of the men from the train\nOr as scary as that story is um it's still not as scary in some respects to some of the things that are happening in science and that's why Michael Guillen will join this just a minute a couple of things in crypto news tonight though there is a strange cloud on Mars\nAnd\nIf you go to coast to coast am dot com you can find out more about that story that may come up when we go to open lines in the third and fourth hours of the show also the ah the story about the small town which claims to be the most haunted place\nIn

in the show roll it in\nDowntown Oregon air our parents just like at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity\nWitness that finds hero trees candidates dispensary behold if you dare they

you can go see the whole story and coast to coast am dot com\nAnd look at the video and then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know\nYour ... believe me there's there's a lot to talk to a an about coming up on coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lot of years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh uh uh later on or\nIf you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science and into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a terrific tell me and say you know she's\nA she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nA ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very ...\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent do me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family and ... and but I mean I what what is\nThe science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life ... eye and say try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that like old school um [noise] what I ... in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or\nOnto a super computer and then downloaded onto it very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can uh can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is the artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... ...\nAnd you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and\nCornell when I started at myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and I were in the wisdom and Buddhism and Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life\nAnd she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested in like ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my my age very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of
