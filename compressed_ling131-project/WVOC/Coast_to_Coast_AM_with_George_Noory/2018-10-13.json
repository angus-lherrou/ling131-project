help to breast cancer research foundation by making an insect any than skinny\nLittle things mean everything getting tired and I said family I think\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drawing or something\nI practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel about them\nAnd they accumulate in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nKinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit\nOr that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after\nThe spirit first sometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest is ... ... ...\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nIf if everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal courageous I wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistant on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know for the times that are already in the homes from time to come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional but have it we're one\nAnd I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion not the only one\nThat are qualified extra systems just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this

don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately but what what this thing was doing was it was singing and ... song\nThat I'd never heard really is I Can't it's grain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing ... and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house and now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just learn\nAn extra sisters not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people

telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just\nWorking negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained because I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey you're really really hard you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients\nThat I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already by different things so remarkably news it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common\nUh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really do in business or a house\nAnd so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and\nSo negative emotional energy attract negative spirit and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful\nBut I mean think of the moon energy dinner\nElated and so people become uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clear recession or forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know Marshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've

sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical around and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy and the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of an immediate death but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it\nBecause it ... the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits study how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the

Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things\nIt's not my job you don't have time for these spirits out there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I worked for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields\nI don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore the physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possessed or anything we just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or pub the pub whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kinda stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people that\nTo me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they\nLove it you know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of a loose a tree but afterwards I woke up right after and\nSo sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr ... in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in the in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened Keith thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nDoing Joan okay where you are\nI'm engaged in ... um I had a um a thing and then I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little bit to engage them and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if

with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels\nYou would think they would welcome that\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that you cut out the

and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil onto your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts we can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the the Sarah from were actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the the heavenly thrown up God
