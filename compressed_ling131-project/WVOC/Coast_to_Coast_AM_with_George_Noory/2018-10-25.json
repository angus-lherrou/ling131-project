civil war\nTroop they acted when they go back and look at the things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in a civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare an ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guy who was the definition of war and I says well\nIt's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars sometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups were there'd be right or left\nHow many faction of groups that we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down the list of black lives matter me too\nI mean just go

Fox News police in Los Angeles reports have wondered safe and handed over to the FBI another suspicious package this what founded a male sorting facility address to the California offices of congresswoman Maxine Waters\nYou know we've been talking to some of these employees leaving the facility some of them are very confused about what's going on here but they all know that this package did in fact at Maxine Waters name on it one telling us that she believed that the package had very very similar markings or an id Scott On it just like the other packages\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know things ... he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but\nBottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously ... these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America knew George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that weigh in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat as your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated\nThis problem I Do believe that the media bears as\nYou know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nNote on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre ... one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages olds maybe they'll go to the public eye if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their some keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out\nThe truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals\nAre individuals in institutions in in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this with somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because\nI Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know ... every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew most takes more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf ... did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged him\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue and let's stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin ... as

probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time of being very very high um ... agree I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat me and all kinds of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI you at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera at\nThe post offices I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the evidence that's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to uh be profitable\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left or optics story real quick\nI mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the ISPs going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new van system in the high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever

being in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder out I went ... interviewed stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near the big bear and\nI think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo they just stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field of view ...\nThese days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out what's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there you said there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like they're about one point six climates per star that break out the star\nAnd our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred\nBillion stars all that means one hundred and sixty billion planets so they're all over the\nPlace and you know that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization it'll ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course we're not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we've come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we're ... we're fusion for example or you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop ... their world was created in four thousand B. C. that's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be [laughter]\nYeah just a little little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know her family [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize that the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place out whether this is a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization or maybe people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throws a planet that they put in incarcerated people\nYou know like yeah like a personal ad boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really\nStand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of how we bring expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so lead to a huge number of planets and [noise]\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there were a life out there and we see it mhm you know they would make contact and I have on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people money coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and there's still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the\nBig or or still slap\n[laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us all learned that if it's a more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of climate the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh oh no [laughter] no ... and so what we\nAnd you can tell from another thing or the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that at all these people don't get the goodies of our from their work [noise] uh we take for leaving 'cause we're stocking up on and on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to saying that's human nature a but it appears to be close to what it is [laughter]\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how\nWhat are we know enough to say that ah it's all a lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know come to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place\nI'll ... person in on almost kind of stuff and [noise] gee the universe crowded you know it takes a

have you been what's new you're still investigating big foot and everything else\nWell I'm doing great and I'm Still on\nThe counters an extra says it was for people and I've just written this new book\nThat does include big foot ... ... ... that's the only a a retired police officer in white all New York that\nBack in Nineteen Seventy six had a near face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual in white all New York very soon as names off buying God one\nAnd so it's going to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a\nCopy and ... you for already endorsing the book yes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that in covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have heart there\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from like super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer Godwin and went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and that I've had dialogue with officer God when since then he's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers\nUh over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods and they reported it to the local police and\nSo the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big a deal might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and we're dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like uh of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book V. knock it talks about the ... the son of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called the now from\nThose national um had unnatural sex acts with the beast of the field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah you know mated with\nMhm and I find anything to do to\nNow think about this and a lot of these cases there seems to only be one foot print there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy ... of of these types of friends\nAnd I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax\nThen perhaps this\nCreature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a\nPattern here of investigators or eye witnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think in the old Patterson give them and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] ...

secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past there was only four I remember right\nWell no I I remember governor calmly and his wife Fagan act are as well because supposedly governor calmly with head off though with one of those bullets well\nNo you're right the governor's convoy was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where was uh where was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with in front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nDirt cheap there and I can't remember if the if\nThe seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife\n... what you want you know them well you know ... you know about the con Connelly\nIf I remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they tracked a bullet\nConnelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAt so the so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they were in another so it it would have been a row of sitting there and and the\nDriver or a or any other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people and\nThat would have been six strange route and Tom is looking at it and what do you look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your speaker downtime and tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up to the ... film and I'm watching them come over

don't see a third row of seats\nI I didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either bell thanks to a guy\nThat's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was too Secret Service agents at the front seat\nAnd then a second row with Governor primary and his wife and his wife was to his lap and the president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt's true and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front dry bean because everybody accused him now turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this than I studied that as well as William Cooper is while he was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nJeeze driving so that means he'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make the perfect shot you know with this last

George\nParker Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers\nYou're right did I that's got to but you have you read Karen\nI have been doing great George how about you and I'm great together we just did not live\n... sure enough for people who need to know who you are here in Norman is the ... board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we we divorced tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things talking boards ... boards\nMarlon I'm more moral mark ... believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind of let's say it that way she's very kind\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the weeds you board folks as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it or burn feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge has to do with the use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWhat a lot of people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nA from a place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover than the whole the whole atmosphere around the school changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I don't believe in it that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength within and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that kind of ... and beyond\nThat kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating and communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have there is no hidden spirit imbued or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in these rounds\n... have you ever had a bad ...\nNo I haven't had bad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants and war and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were crossing the\nBorder but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage if somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude\nI'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse for the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might aboard\nAn eye on a diet and go good and going\nAnd that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful\nOf everything that's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment within me that I could really a strengthen myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plant yup you're on is that the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving\nWill answer that from a few different directions one as many people believe in India motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles it through the powers that gesture is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds that's one thought about it to a third one is\nA is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nThat's amazing work when it happened in ...\nThe amazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say\nWhen you come to the plan chat and you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning of frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower the heirs to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plants have to move and for for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls or the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though Karen to put somebody down if they don't like the ... board met I appreciate\nWell I I you know that's that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he's one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness\nAnd this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness ocean I'm not for that I'm for having a discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions\nThis tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use the tool this kind of floor are different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff with all of us believe it doesn't work\nSome of some of the leaves it works because of eating motor and a few of my believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have a love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nHaunted the board start and and how how long ago\nWell there's there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando has term do we just ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out\nUm he turns it we just dishes because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece\nThat is not true there's a different detonation tool that started back then\nThe first board that we have a we have an understanding of because we have a history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board is Eighteen eighty six known as the which board now we know this board existed and was made by a company called the ws read toy company\nAnd George the cool thing about this is it's really interesting history\nThe people who manufacture this board\nSent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for for his wedding gift and we know this I Know and we know this because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published\nI mean there are ... the PR yeah now what do you think
