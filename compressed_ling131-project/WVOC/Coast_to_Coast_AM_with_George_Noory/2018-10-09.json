if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain is a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm On my probably cost about a I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWill do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with uh\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nI think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems may be much much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\n... is it the human being\nThe main thing that fuels their technology is it's actually finally working\nOr even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence in one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNew ... you know three laws of planetary motion the laws of magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business it can make probably any department in your business and ten percent ... percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before until we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances in a ah ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um artificial intelligence\nThe simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said uh it has a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're gonna make autonomy Skilling systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nUm could could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say\nYou know leave shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally a daily but that is because people request and show a it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a weapon\nSystems it's good to have been well for\nFor three very easy reasons you can argue the uh the the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you going to argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... and ... and whatever country you are and and\nThird you know they won't they won't work to be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately what were the political costs are going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing well\nIt may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that\nYou know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with artificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out where George ...

to be hard on the travel agents at the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that God created us there ... you wouldn't have seen at sea air being be rubber\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great job and destroys\nBad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they you you still a drink you know the robot cat a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you are the special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we\nEvery human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have Roebuck stick can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just\nWay beyond you know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet I'm\nIn that today and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we have these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we can't really explain\nLike I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm you\nGot three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so spectacularly amazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of bars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for law of human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so big and knew\nThat it just changed the productivity of humanity forever\nAnd the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man if was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize on I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time\nThings changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got two technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you kind of shut your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet because we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that's the only official intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if you if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty color maybe forty Ninety Seventy you had a million women enter the workforce every year\nI used to say only ones left and then it was just listed GE and so none of the companies around the Dow originally the big powerhouses or they're\nYou know sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't didn't they didn't catch on right blockbuster ... another one\nExactly with regard to drones I agree with you we're we're gonna have to work that out and you know where where in such early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs is going to have to be laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because uh that's a very real\nWorking remote\nYou know I I kind of hope so I I don't know that I Would say a blanket thing for for every single person on the planet like because you can just ...\nCareers that you you can't like the uh electrician or a ballet dancer or\nYou know anything that requires a psychiatrist or anything to require a a kindergarten teacher requires you to be president in any in any way but for people who are in the information industry then yeah there was just there was a series of commercials on I don't

say that because\nThey don't have to be ... there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you\nSlow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream about whether it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough of all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there\nAnd so I don't think we would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in the world Ritchie also my last day you know we live in a world a universe\nThat

dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThat morning and thanks for having me on the shows and think interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that you're still at the age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as\nWorking alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you\nCan work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home but not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours\nA week if if if I productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology um\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFixed by rote probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... style than than being a wire fan now and they can pay for and and ... ... ... ... cat in may\nAnd will tell them that any woman named ... and ... it gets half the fan out with and now they're\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're the guest barb is entirely right are we are using a ton of his weapons which may kill decisions of course we've done that\nSince landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill\nA so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books were sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or is it by ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's\nGoing to jump to their simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened plot if you look starting Seventeen fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created or eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming ... all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to feed all the hungry people\nIn the world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost

about him where he is just allowed me and to\nUm like the the theater where they record all the music and he said Julie stand here this is where the director stands and they you know it's the best

about my day job you\nDo the job we haven't done the Oklahoma new Bill Bill ... [laughter]\nI Do I have a fabulous job\nAnd you how did you end up in Los Angeles sounded the truck work for you\nUm you know I think it was a slow escape from Oklahoma\nAnd I made it to Texas first and then made my way to San Francisco and then maybe the way down to Los Angeles\nAnd here you are and here I Am talking to you\nWriting stories about ghosts and interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers said about the fact that I mean here you are you were corporate executives doing some great work and now you're writing a story about to go to talk of\nYou know this it's it's a it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization is being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff and you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people have kind of gone with me on the journey\nUm I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right\nTo our nine that's right um but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this\nLike there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy which is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their they'll talk about their experiences because so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd the mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when this started happening to me\nUm I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything that goes photography a little bit about medium ship just to get some of those things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go there were almost the majority\nAttorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is going to work with that are saying yes every two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is listening um but they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because of a personal situation\nYes she did did you know\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey and develop transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers a and you know I I you you're not only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone on and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about and get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh he goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photograph of\nDo you have been doing this show me things what kind of camera do you [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used in what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam signed camera not found but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that ... you know are unimportant in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for you this entire journey let's let's get into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] had an email I'm Sorry say you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted investigating these strange things\nYeah I Am you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some\nI'm an old uh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how big me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started\nKnow after I saw the first coast\nAnd a photograph I um you know I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as in it's not true\nA skeptic that you want to know\nRight right I it it was a navy this can't possibly be true kind of person but you know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos\nAnd when you're in\nChaos um you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things\nLike this I'm with a lot of eased because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it and I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a photo lab on like negative mode or add some color because you different things would come out I became\nShe said imagine what would

Adam and Eve away from God to today\nYou get that scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all it's a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space on so many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory it's a pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have it are bad because you know what\nThe light does it need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that

said how her my name is wrong because I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not\nVery nice cheese\nAnd I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people there to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare either going to find that thing that triggers you right there to find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird
