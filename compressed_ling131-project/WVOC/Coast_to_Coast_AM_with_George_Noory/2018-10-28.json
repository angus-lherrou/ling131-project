only protect myself but anybody that might that might come under attack\nAgainst the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry at churches but that that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to uh I live in Texas so loud too many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target the simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my going in\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family\nAnd for me and that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for a ... there's no protection\nWhatsoever I

I saw it on TV a gigantic whale\nWashed ashore where and and foreign Oregon Florida coast huh and so somehow\nI don't know where you entered the picture I mean did you see the whale and know about the well before you know what\nWhat happened the art is is at that time I worked for a national company and we had a plant here in Springfield, Oregon and we were planning to build a\nKind of a satellite plant in the Florence area to to utilize all the way from the mills in that area down there\nAnd why I Want to Florence in the workplace we didn't want anybody to know we were down and we were down there looking for a property\nAuto we didn't want to uh you know property goes when I Know you're looking for property all we found it becomes a lot more expensive that's right so we had been talking to Wilbur attorney who was the port commissioner at that time I Believe he's port commissioner again he's been mayor found them\nBelievers support them as a hell of a nice guy\nSo I got the logo air pollution guy Vern Atkinson and I had a realtor by mark ... and my twelve year old son and we had an appointment with Wilbur nine o'clock in the morning so\nWe got in a car or not we drove down to Florida and we went to the port commission off of them\nI walked in and announced that we were there and they said well Mr turned against him here I could what do you mean he was mayor we have an appointment at nine o'clock right and we were up by the way we're also trying to where we are going to promote a port revenue bond that the reason we were working through the port commissioner\nThough I says well wherever they said well he's out at the north Jedi ... the the oil washed ashore out there so\nWhen we got all the information we thought wow what the hell were here let's go see the oil well sure when we drove on out there and it's quite a ways out there\nAnd it was a large pave parking lot and you can see the ocean because there's a very a huge boon between the parking and and and the ocean itself but we pulled into the parking lot and that was that just happened to be one spot left\nThe we pull the car in there and then we proceeded to to walk and go up over top of the known when we got to the top of the down you could you look down at at at the uh the water's edge and sure enough there you are twenty times sperm whale\nPlenty tons that's what they estimate it\nOh well there I'm sure it was every bit of that it looked a I saw people standing next to it and they were door yeah this was big\nSo we were able to fortunately get down and they were kind of keeping people back but but the vernacular that apple Asian guy knew Wilbur quite well and we were able to go right down there with what actually went away I was in the smell you couldn't believe the smell of this thing I don't know how long this thing with dad\nBut it came ashore and and uh it was just it was just\nAwful it was on its way very very rare that somebody in the night before had taken the chain on cut the lower jaw to get the teeth I understand the teeth or ... oh no kidding yeah somebody had ripped off the the whole jaw\nSo's mutilated twenty John Wales\nSo we we kinda sooner on air and shouting around there and they are the people there from the highway department and we were all kind of talking to gather and you know I said well what are you going to do and and a fellow that for my way to buy me as well because I'm going to blow it up I thought well you know okay not a problem\nI got a hold of the guy that run the highway can make and then I started telling them the story and he says I got to stop pieces you got to tell me he did anybody get hurt might that not only because I have to stop by ... he said this is the funniest story I ever heard in my life\n[laughter] well is there any way that you know\nOther than what you told us about the decision making this somehow I mean you figure this gets turned over to the highway department and you know the guys the guy's a dynamite and they just aren't true and I know they start chewing it over trying to figure out how to get rid of this whale and I just really would like to know how they came to the decision to blow it up\nGot I don't have any idea how they came to that decision but the but the tape that the San Francisco news channel did they interviewed quite a few people on on the tape and and uh they said the written report that this fellow wrote that everything went according to plan\nAnd then [laughter] and then they said what happens when you're in a bureaucracy when everything goes according to a planet than six months later he got promoted\nHe got promoted [laughter] you know there's this sort of a thread you say that was twenty five years ago huh yeah it's still seems to work that way today

dynamite you need\nYou ... and ... mind me of a guy telling me the story\nIs there actually want any way to calculate how much dynamite it would've taken too as they wish to do a ... or turn into little tiny particles on I\nThink what they should have done up they were going to use the ... you know with what some may be the case or two and a single stick on top of the well put planned on top of it\nSo it was you were kind of blow it and pull apart in place more or less we still have to bury the peace but at least you'd have smaller pieces to bury\nYeah but and but uh this guy I thought he

yeah uh about that well yes the right thing to do is Buddha bought across the way I Do watch uh bill Marr a steel bar yeah I voted across the oil yes\nAnd then die or open drag it out to eat then you blow it up that's what they probably could have done to fatten up I remember that time there was a pretty good fight against foreign and if they had to go you know got a big net or something and put around that and put them dynamite in a drug it out a couple of miles and then cut off\nWell see that's why I really the only part of this story that I don't have and I wish I could get and I will pursue is the genesis of it when these guys were sitting around whether it was in an office or in a bar after work whatever you know how they came up with this\nThat would be good to know the minutes

say you must have seen that interview actually going on yeah yeah oh you did so uh there there he was young he looked pretty proud and he was only attitude after all of this was over\nRespectively was that he had not used enough dynamite\nThat that's I that's why they told the guy from Sports Illustrated [laughter]\nUh west of the Rockies are running out of time you're on the air with wall I'm an

Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they save us ... paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster noted suicide the government can vote otherwise\nBlah blah blah but this is now all of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that old OK\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're all sort of thing that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like that or any note to one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what the party policemen FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote in my article which you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know he wanted a minimum of ...\nWell the only they was funny that you know the ... yeah vi\nCrime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows that may be a lot of crime going on there\n[noise] [noise] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration than it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great clogged with mission because the note\nFound in a briefcase the search the police at that they were suspicious of the fact that that brief case search by empty\nBut not bound looked at it second it um benefited or people at the White House and\nTook the onus off approving the suicide third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn mutilated crumple from things build on it\nOftentimes an effort\nTo make it come power that difficult difficult sure they'll already you have a primary ...\nAt the English experts at\nA physician then you look at the no and the first of all the note if you look at the no which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that they do not match that the way the the stroke structures are done the\nFlow the slant of the letters is not the same\nSo then from a clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery well\nIt is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say the let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut I had a larger will not do it that way he'll write the line down they'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top and bring them around\nYou can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter beef for example um was done in three stroke structured trope unlike officer who had a very\nTenuous ... style of writing uh-huh which you can all we had a dolphin documents that week character to three different fourth I'm Still\nVery very clear that we ah that that that they will eat isn't a match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nLike you like me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now but this has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step\nEver knows how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it right there where the bottom of the hour we'll be right back with Chris Ruddy\nAnd will tell

Watergate pale by comparison there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some the various political purpose\nHere you might be talking about the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved in a story was manufactured\nOr murder\nOr whatever it is it doesn't it even even justice was bird and the FBI to use their proper procedures and investigating that belief used an examiner to certify the document that never was certified as a handwriting expert\nUh\nSo obviously no one really care to properly investigated\nMr ... one of the experts probably with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination and he was the one that ... that are found the palm prints of we are beyond the rifle a she is an expert in late fingerprint\nA note was torn for the audience the reporters it's twenty eight ... ...\nAnd they were shown how many fingers had to come in contact with different piece of paper Mr we said his statement that this is consistent the fact that they had no fingerprint for only impression bumping papers it's consistent with the person to toward having worn gloves\n[noise] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic story so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I Know this is touchy territory Chris letter\nThe eight page today\nPromise the number of people that call on the media world here in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd what people are calling up yeah we did it we're doing it well we did it when we find out what it meant was to paragraph three paragraphs at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nAnd he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him in the current edited the park and the stem witness left immediately\nUm the park police never went and visited him to to be with him they spelled his name wrong and they hit the police report\nOr when the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was this man they gave you menacing look it's a Mexican American man and the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify on the line up or possibly get from this man what\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch all the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in their report now this would maybe be a mistake if\nIt happened one when we have so many instances and that's the case you know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man in and around forced his car they found it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up just before the body without\nAlright look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know even in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery thing then you're tampering with forces that have already gone an awful long way here in and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's risk involved in anything you do I've\nTaken those risks and will continue to take the thrift because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the trip for half the flow where they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that the one that kind of\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of thought to this though I mean what was\nSo look if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the crime people behind expose again\nYeah I guess that's what I'm saying well look and look what\nYou know here Mike Wallace did the teeth and I think I that that the on the last time you know my brother called me up after the ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never want it to a big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watched it and it makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing that story um so what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I'd never reported that foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe but\nI was going to be held responsible for every era that any newspaper ever done in this case um eat only in the Cape to people out there that to look into it\nThat I'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make for ... ... me or when Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the associated ... abreast under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I have not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it sends a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the king media I don't know if everyone but the king media the leaders on sixty minutes the lead program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer sixty minutes thing then he helped get Clinton elect Clinton elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast Bill Clinton

connections with the\nClintons are not good at governing ah but they're very good at dealing with the media handling\nThe seat in is spinning and [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview

adjust and and and coach Jeremy Pruitt's ability to adjust and get those quick reads out for him to get that ball out of their take the hit but they're all going to be complete and getting space\nYeah well South Carolina defense was able to get pressure but for for some strange reason and the announcer had spoke about it he talked to Dr Robinson a earlier in the week and his objective was not to give up any\nA deep balls the past as well that you know that's kind of been South Carolina's a a thing throughout the year had a really give it up a really big plays but however\nUh in doing that we were we were playing kind of cushions on the corners and in our secondary and giving up a lot of stuff underneath so I really didn't understand we're getting the pressure but no no adjustments were being made to take away that space underneath and that was killing us all night\nYou know I don't I don't know where the adjustments need to be made for South Carolina defensively I felt like there were a lot of times tonight where they were just miss aligned there were several times where there were three wide receivers on one side of the field and had to defend her ...\nSo ... ... ... it's\n... adjustments need to be made in game mid snap\n[laughter] like empathy and snaps even um I'm not sure you can't really blame it on youth on the defense although there were times tonight where South Carolina was plain three freshman in the secondary yeah well that comes\nFrom a lead that comes from your team leader on defense calling out those plays we don't kind of we don't really have that guy yet that can really controlled it back into the soccer on a defense now that'll come with time that'll come with experience but it's not there yet yeah\nIt's not there yet and I would come

the best game taught suffrage\nNews radio five sixty\nWBRC number to call nine seven eight WBRC nine seven eight nine eight six do\nYou want to talk about tonight's win over the Tennessee Volunteers first time you'll get a chance to talk about a win on the program since the sixth of October thank you to a bye week we're talking a little bit about South Carolina's defense\nAnd the adjustments that need to be made because you know yes South Carolina did win by three tonight but that doesn't mean that everything was perfect or\nBy no stretch of the imagination so let's talk a little bit about the defense and where we left off before the break pops talking about that defensive leader you got DJ want him back which again final play the game he gets the fact they're really into the game so that proves to\nTo immediately have an impact on the team um\nAnd you got pressure all night\nAnd Jaycee horn played really well and the secondary and you didn't hear much at every shot that in which means he was walking down his guy\nBut at the same time Tennessee just deep and dumped their way down the field and not so much over the middle of the field but just swing outside screen outside it just constantly and South Carolina had a hard time\nAre defending against it and you were even saying here in the fourth quarter you take a chance to beat up you know it's coming so\nIs that something that South Carolina has the athletic ability to do right now do you think it's maybe a talent issue what can be going on on that defense besides football\n... you know if we kind of had this uh a few years back when the defense was that was young ah it's a kind of a a a scheme to protect the players from themselves you know these younger players making bad decisions uh but you know the the thing about Tennessee tonight is they didn't really take any shots down field\nToo loose in South Carolina up so so for them to be playing you know off the ball in in in protection of the deep threat all night was just very curious on up you know on my part well you know watching it\nBecause of because of the lack of a down feel threats now that may have been because of this game South Carolina was playing and they just saw that it would you know there's gotta be impenetrable thrown him down field like that but they were able to like you said execute a sideline to sideline and that's where you know a lot of that yard was coming from\nYet ... finished twenty seven of thirty nine for two hundred and seven yards so he averaged five point three yards per completion had two touchdowns no interceptions both touchdowns came in the first half and if I'm looking down here has receivers numbers are\nCalloway was his big time receiver nine catches for eighty six yards the average nine point six yards per catch\nI Would like to see the numbers on that in terms of yards after catch because that's all tendency was doing all day which allowed them to to loosen up with the run game on some off tackles and in some a little jets sweeps at times just try to lose them up because we all knew it coming in Tennessee dolphins of line was just a hot\nPile of garbage heading into the game and a lot of that has to do with a a tray there they're one of their office of linemen with blood clots in his lungs obviously he's in I'm\nAble to play it All right now in our thoughts are with him obviously but I'm just tendency often devices wasn't good for South Carolina keys up a a good pass rush that got home a lot than just the ability by Jeremy Pruitt in his coaching staff to understand where they are as a team\nThey coached that well I feel like on the other side South Carolina didn't as much\n[noise] yeah yeah 'cause I'm Carolina was in a in a band but don't break mode um and you know if it worked for them a ... obviously looking at the end result uh it worked for them or almost came back to bite him\nAre but a tendency I think they're skiing came back to bite into a little bit at the end 'cause like we said they didn't really take any shots down field and I think\nYou know that came to you know solve chronic kind of realize that towards the end of the game and they were able to like you said bring more pressure and then a cheat up just a little bit there are a couple of those key a third downs right at those those labs those that last series\nA were broken up by the game Cox because they were to stay home or they knew the Tennessee wasn't going deep so I think it kind of beat them in the end up there you know ... Tennessee\nAbsolutely have I think it did they didn't do a good job of stretching\nSouth Carolina's defense now South Carolina on the other side of the ball it real quick before we leave the defense I thought South Carolina's deepest made the play when they needed to which they do you ask them all night just make a play make a stop just get a stop here and they did so it kinda reminded me a little bit of two thousand fourteen\nIn terms of they were given up a lot of yards but in this case at the end of the game they were able to get to stop the next two dozen fourteen defense really couldn't which has a lot about these young guys who are playing defense right now but the off inside the ball on the other side I thought South Carolina where Tennessee didn't stretch\nSouth Carolina's defense all that much I thought South Carolina the play calling of Brian Clinton for the most part today was extremely solid run the ... early and then allow that to open up your passing game and the second half to allow some of those deep\nUm you know in that in that regard a little bit too loose in the run game a that we've done we should have been but uh we we stayed away from the explosive place down the field which is really you look back two weeks ago when they beat over and they had a bunch of explosives down the field and we stayed away from that\nUh we wanted to play the screen game better those are the two key is to me going in the game planning this team and and we didn't do that as well defensively and I thought what is it a nice job of the most part especially Israel and in the game they're Rico needs a slide in ... in ... in the sand bounds in that situation and a lot to be able to to certainly kill the caught there at the end but\nUm that's the situation we cover when he's obviously do a better job coaching it so I'll be very proud of our team a you know took a stand here and and uh I Know our our fans deserved to win at home in a against an FCC good football team and we did that open up for any questions are going to Mexico City they\nWill you mentioned the success in their own game a first was at a concerted effort to keep the ball on the ground and also um was Tyson starting maybe kind of a message to recover was out your\nSon's done a nice job of practice well you know so much for us goes into how you practice and I know I'm I'm\nSomewhat young when I was younger I used to be but I'm Still old fashioned and you know you normally go and play like you practice and that's just what I Believe it's not a knock on Rico at all he does he works hard um but um you know we have confidence and all those guys you put mine in their in a situation finally he's getting healthy he can get to where he can carry\nThe ball but I but we check more under on which obviously slows us down in Tempe I'm a little bit but I thought we were very effective with the temple and the second half of that helped us tremendously in the run game it got them out of kilter a little bit defensively bounce them out of some gaps Jake kept the ball several times which is always helped us be more effective in the run game\nThere was a bunch of to a lot more than we had planned on\nAnd that's why Bryan we run just domes we're gonna continue to run the football they're going to give this to cause as hard hit some balls down the field now we hit them on the one speech sweep off the pomp that we set up early in the game to Brian for the big one on the big post and were able to split them up but you know when they're giving you that much split safety they got a less guy in the box and that that attribute it to some foreign game\nThey wanted to stay away from explosive plays down the field they said in the splits safety and that's why we're in the ball\nDJ wanna returns and he gets a strips act basically when the game can you just talk about how nice it just happened back how did you think he played today\nWe'll watch type of ... D jays good football players very productive and everything he does um and uh\nIt's great to have him back but he's a very good football player but he also gives you a presence on your football team as far as leadership and a calmness and\nAnd now we play and a lot of the guys look to DJ uh when when things maybe aren't going so well and DJ's or one of those factors that are as a coach you you certainly breathe all easier when he's around\nOr when the decision to have Brian on the sidelines and what was his kind of presence there and how to how\nWe haven't been as productive at the receiver position\nIn our first six ball games for whatever reason\nI'm Brian came to me and said I I feel like me going down on the field may calm them down some between some wraps and do a better job of communicating things to them it's not the name one wasn't doing a good job on some on before\nBut I agreed with him and then you know we got the situation with a Missouri game and we lost the headsets and he came down and I felt really good game and I said as long as you can see the game and you feel comfortable calling it we're fine and we thought that pat went up and pat and then that\nReally good job of communicating things to brown on the sideline\nUp out of the operation was work well\n\nAnd that's what I wanted to hear most from well during his post game press her and I mentioned that to you pops that uh I noticed the Clinton early in the I thought I saw him and I says Brian on the sidelines because I Know I Know he's a booth guy\nUm and then later on I mean it was confirmed that he was down there so I just wanted to know maybe was at an effort to help the wide receivers was that maybe ... and ability to call the game better from the field or whatever the case may be for Brian letting it worked out for South Carolina tonight and I thought the wide receivers played extremely well\nUm and the parents had a bit of a flow to it must have talked about that\nAnd being hard headed in the run game they were giving\nA South Carolina was getting too high eighties over the top which is hard to throw against so you're going to keep running the ball at Tennessee would have switched to a single high safety\nThen you're you're going to see more Bentley pulling on the Arpaio and trying to find an open passing light so I I think all things together worked for South Carolina throughout the game and kinda molded their way to win I think another thirty minutes South Carolina may have been able to pull the way in this one\nYeah you know I think it help from a Clinton to be down on the field because sometimes the difference between communicating the play\nOr to the to the field versus explaining\nWhy you're communicating that place it appeals to him being there he's able to uh explains receivers exactly uh what he wanted from certain situations in a a that was to their benefit to today\nAre kind of likes burger used to do I mean he was able to be the quarterback on the sidelines he could see what the defense we're going in\nAnd audible out or something or or allow a translate that to the quarterback so that he could a ... article out of something so I'm there so you know ... is it always helps to have a coach from the sideline explaining exactly what he's trying to have a get done on the field\nYeah because the Dan and pat we're both up top that's cooked at Washington and Dan Warner and that's your eyes and this guy that are so\nThat you're tied into coaching your quarterbacks coach so put be Mack up there as well I mean went off into coaches were let down on the the ... yeah yeah and and body mentally ... those are the two\nAnd like you said they're playing in that are that are too high\nA safety defense very frustrating for receivers that play against I Know being a former receiver because you know you're dealing with your guy kind of at the line then got a safety over top so really the only thing kind of open his kind of the middle of the field and if the play if you don't if you're places not being called there\nYeah you know that then you you have problems and especially when you're not using your titans as much as a we haven't been this year so\nHow frustrating is that for a wide receiver to be playing a game like this where your numbers not getting caught a whole lot in the first half you're running the ball a lot um they're playing too high so you know you're not going to get your number called very much is that frustrating at all for wide receiver you just ... mostly concerned about the success of the fence\nYeah you you you're concerned about this is that so they often do you have to block that out and you have to key on your block stay and you because you know they you know your blocks are gonna be vital to your crack backs and stuff in a holding your blocks on the edge of you know to make the run successful so you just think you know think about that once you start thinking about your own numbers you're you're you're going to get in trouble so\nYou you you think for the team and as long as the team's winning you're good to go\nYeah and not to mention they meant a must champ in that post game press or mentioned that Brian level to split that too high safety over the top that was the most impressive throw Jay mentally had all season\nYeah that was a nice throw I said I just waited that out as a nice strike you know a right down the middle was on the money hit him in stride can throw it better than that so and those are the kind of have to catch too so yeah you know he let him well oh yeah yeah not any had the time like I said the offensive line came to time to throw\nSo that the ... all that this scenario whole worker work together right there that kind of throws in place we need to make to be successful\nAnd look at the underneath of that you're all friends of mine blocked well doing so with a back up and a true freshman year quarterback made to throw in a season where he certainly had the hips and your best why your best sure wide receiver who has had a bad case of the drops all year\nWas able to make a catch ... space his cell from a defender to get extra yards after the catch all of that work together\nAll while having a whole bunch of stuff underneath that would give everyone calls to say this isn't going to work so South Carolina did a lot of things really well tonight that they haven't done really well all year round the ball consistently consistently moved the chains on third down as a lot of things worked well for South\nCarolina tonight it's just haven't been working well for them all season but they are now foreign three and they get a twenty seven twenty four when over the tendency volunteers tonight plenty more to come on the fourth quarter post game show on news radio five sixty WBRC\nCaroline affair and your luck drawn to the best game got coverage on news radio five sixty Silvio sees\nNo they were out coached at times tonight I'm a ... we have to face that\nUm you know they were out schemes at times are but they were able to put together plays when they needed to and that was the key tonight they got some defensive stopped when they needed to uh and they were able to obviously put together some great offensive series when he needed to end up it was a debate I think the momentum\nCompletely turned around when we tied the game up a cause I I think that you point conversion was kind of a broken play we score tied the game up in that kind of said hey put in your mind you can win this game if you can make a few stops and then also uh take care of the ball and that's what we did and I\nYeah I Would I Would argue they were out coached more than out at work but right in the White House and that's just that's just my opinion and I'll give

and\nYeah they were they were really they were really into it tonight when it comes to just making things happen\nOr in the stands and and\nMan that ... same you'll catch was unreal and so DJ want him in ... actually played together for the first time since the season opener and Bryson says that it was great having want him back from an ankle injury just in time for that big final play on defense to win the game for the game Cox\nUh you tell them all the time 'cause my ... or you know working we're competing with them or\nIs it is right in my job like if you have it in one of those Saddam\nHow ironic is that in his first came back he makes the play to help you win the game I\nMean that's who you are so it was walking both so you go I mean that's my ... like I said I just see what your privacy ... on the way we compete with each other I mean he's a he's a talented player so you know but um but\nHow hard was it for you to sit out due to\nA very hard but you know I stay positive through the process of ... of them are ethical by where I ... think again strongly that this is not ready to play\nA DJ how did how did it feel to basically eyes the game with a with a ... near the end I feel great man you know I work for a while maybe or her I worked for you know just kept working working never got down you know just came back and you know basically\nA fraud are you guys you know what adjustments as you guys can generally make on third down there were converting a lot you know whether the guys were in Mandarin zone it seemed like you were doing a lot of different things what eventually got your guys at least on the positive side of that ledger\nOut to slow down slowly you know what I Know of fall back on to it and you understand you know that goes from it as what a couple of days or ... and the understanding that you know you've got to do our job as a friend who you know ... ... is because you know a lot of teams now they just try to get the ball on from there because you know had on the ... so I'm you know the armor we've got to run to the ball\nGet on there and try to you know stops and those are some of those long rows outside or that basically what they are\n... that I mean he's right Bryson's pretty spot on with that those are the swing\nTests the outside really are just like long runs like long toss plays or any sort of off tackle run it just seems like South Carolina for whatever reason I mean for a really long time and it's not just the staff as as soon as I talked to has been struggling\nCovering a screen passes and the spread type ... for a long time it's just something they've never really been able to defend well but it when it came to it that\nWe were watching that final play in South Carolina we said oh there you you said pops out they're dropping aid that little I don't know I don't know and they were able to get pressure with three and DJ want him how big is that for him and his first game back\nHow much of a confidence boost is that for him to make that play to seal the went well\nIt you know it that was a big hit shows his athleticism because you know we're not we we haven't been ah the greatest pass rush team\nOr do you know in the SEC all season so uh you know for him to come in especially you know that's what a you know kind of keep me where only bring three on that last play ah we're normally not successful bringing three but it just just sold his athleticism does he he was able to shed the block\nAnd make that big play because uh you know you know we saw a company you know we kind of saw it coming or the way we're playing defensively that uh we get another crossing route there something underneath a near dropping eight or so\nDidn't look too good but he came up with a huge play and that's that's what it's all about that is what are we need out of these guys and uh it came through tonight\nMust chant mentioned not only has athleticism but getting that leadership back yeah I'm On the defensive line and on your defense in general so I feel like now with him back you have your leader at each level of your defense you have won them on the line you have ...\nAt the linebacker position and in my opinion you'd have Jaycee horn and the secondary because I think were shot that in just to emotional um he did actually you didn't hear much out of Russia but he did get an on sportsman like call to go Caroline is what against him\nYeah he didn't ... which is a he's probably talking to all season and it came to fruition tonight where uh you know you kind of listen so again with a kudos to him uh uh for not reacting getting a hothead and the costs when his team\nYeah by the way we were just a circle back around to ah the atmosphere tonight at Williams price a\nSeven thirty ... folks have railed on will much tamper not being able to win and prime time and I know this wasn't a top twenty five team but it was still Tennessee\nAnd that's still an FCC east rival and that still again you need to win and your division and your conference and especially in one of your last home game season you probably got two more\nUm the reason south Carol the reason fans in general don't leave night games early is because you if you leave a day game early gives you a chance to go back home refreshed a little bit then hit whatever social setting you want to go to\nNight games social settings already there and we're going to go you know what I mean yes I think that makes it easier as well um and again a great night for football perfect weather you couldn't ask for better weather and kudos to the fans for showing up showing out being loud and forcing tendency in some mistakes or early in ...\nWe assume you'll have word to us after the ...\nUm in terms of just what the opponent which I think will be Marshall does and can they make their conference championship game ... do you think that's going to play in to these guys minds at all they have that extra game possibly coming at the end of the season [noise]\nI I don't think they're looking at the at right now um [noise] I mean\nObviously when you know you got one in handy here though you've you've got a game in hand\nThat uh you know that could affect you in different ways but I I I think at this point of the season\nThe coaches can get the game Cox focus on this ... this one game at a time theory and uh you know next game up and I think that's where South Carolina ... we would be safe to say they don't have the leisure to kind of look forward to other games they have to take care of business was right in front of them\nYeah I think this team would be hard pressed to look ahead yeah and look past any opponent at this point because South Carolina uh they're four and three so they're one game above five hundred\nI'm ... ... if if you had to give you had to give this season to grade pops well what grade would you give this season right now for and three record\nWell uh you know obviously an overall you'd say well the under chi based on last year a but at the same time with all the ...\nWith all the youngsters they have on this team and a ... I Would say that I Would say probably uh see go you know obviously you know ... out of the question sure they're not they're not ... not terrible so you'd have to be and that so I I Would say I see so far to see\nYeah because I think once the season starts you can't grade this team based on what you thought they would be in July and it's just not fair mhm because at that point everyone's got the chance to make a national championship run right I'm [laughter] last year some teams uh unless you're Vanderbilt but\nYou can't judge a team based on preseason expectation um you know I Would I Would say see mine is\nThat if we were to go into the man is ever going to the minus and plus I'm simply because you look at the games they played 'em they just haven't done a really good job of taking the ball away I I thought they'd be a better team in terms of forcing turnovers um which\nBecause you're not forcing turnovers you're not making up returning the ball over offensively um which puts a lot more pressure on your quarterback and on your audience to make plays and unfortunately for them they haven't been able to string together in a place to\nTo really get a consistent offensive attack going so I I Would go with a C minus right now and again I'm only asking this because it's almost the first time November\nAnd so to third yeah two thirds I guess you could say of the season is put away and you can take stock of it\nAnd you're you're for three and a season where a lot of people would have looked at this good or right now and wonder why do you do have been six in one right five and two\nYeah and I think I I think you make a very fair in a in a great point\nUm you know are about to take a ways because you bet that kind of shows\nA bet you're in kind of like a more of a ... even though it's not appropriate but more of a preventive type defense where you're kind of protecting your players based on not playing a lot of man to man a I think we played more man to man you have a some a little bit more risk taking\nA you know cutting underneath route stuff like that where you're creating turnovers upsetting your safety is free to kind of play on the ball and now that's not happening this year so you know that's why we're giving up a lot of your age between the twenties and you're not seeing the takeaways\nYeah and once again I just want to make this point the south Carolina I'm has only allowed a team score and more than thirty points once this year\nAgain a that is they\nFor whatever it's worth and under the office and he has more and more points for ... for what for whenever it's worth Georgia scored more than thirty they score twenty of that in third quarter\nI'm so South Carolina again defensively they allow a lot between the twenties like we've said but you know\nOnce they get into that red zone you would like to see them force more turnovers but like we said also or you are who you are at this point in the year and so you're playing with the younger guys in the secondary we mentioned earlier in the program they had about three ... freshmen playing in the secondary at one time early in the game tonight you had a freshman or making his first ever career start\nIn a night game and a big time SEC game on the offensive line so you have a lot of young guys which is good which is good for the future of the program right in my opinion you had a guy visiting I don't think it's any secret what recruit was visiting this weekend I'm at again games are important and you've got to win\n'em and you had a great atmosphere and what you did it so um\nI think the building blocks are there uh for what\nCoach must champ and his staff to sell accomplish [noise] um I had a couple of people ask me and the third quarter hit me up and you said you you know is he right going to be on the hot seat and I'm like no\nNo because one bad year performance is one thing if it becomes a pattern that's a problem but you can't let what's happened this year take away from what's happened in the previous where this coaching staff is over a cheat\nSo two years of over achieving can can kind of cover up that one year under achieving just based on comparison right yeah\nAs long as it's not a pattern and I think a a one point where South Carolina's gotten in trouble this year is a defensive run stopping\nAnd I think that plays ... into getting caught that vantage going into this old miss getting because they're they're reasonably good against a pass as ... and we're talking between the twenties here they're reasonably good against a pass don't really give up any big plays a so if they can up to a stop to run which ... which I Will\nMiss is not very good at any way if they can stop that run in a I think we're you know they're set up for a pretty good day if they can uh as long as they're offensively are able to get things accomplished\nYeah I think so I think it'd be interesting atmosphere I think it would be one that South Carolina's players haven't experienced before\nThey play in big time environments they've been down to the swamp they've been in Athens they've been in New Zealand stadium they you know they play in the SEC there's the big three and the other ones or whatever um they've been in Kyle Field\nI think the grove offers a new kind of experience for them in terms of what the atmosphere is like well and how they adjust\nIt different because you don't see it on a yearly basis right so it it's just a little different I don't know if any that are when was the last time we played them I don't know if any of these current ... and eight so none of these current team members or have the experience no yeah not on hand something totally new offer them going into it now also\nWhat do they get a full house based on you know what they're facing this year so uh you know a lot of factors play into that but we we you know we're assuming they're going to have a full house down there a but\nThen again eleven o'clock game uh so I don't know but again like you said we've got to be prepared for that atmosphere and you know that that's always a will give them up three points just for the atmosphere\nSo now yeah [laughter] there's a lot\nThe different ways you can define that atmosphere a little bit more time coming up here on the fifth quarter post game show on the home of the best game caught coverage news radio five

fourteen tackles seven of them were so low a gym I swim says seven as well or J rod reckon other freshmen had a good day Jaycee horn with four tackles as well um\nInterestingly enough price and Alan Williams not very high on this let's yet for tackles they say he didn't have any quarterback curries according to stat sheet which I completely disagree with but that's just my opinion I'm so defensively it looks like South Carolina as a whole they had Seventy team tackles\nA on the afternoon a bunch of different guys contributing to that at multiple levels of the deep and it's part of that has to do with tendency really being able to get the ball in space and and get to the ... and get to the second level but a complete team win tonight wouldn't you say a complete team when\nYeah because everybody had to come up with something on there and so uh you know there was contributions from everybody from the you know obviously the off in the defense and you know when it comes together like that you can get away and if it doesn't you're gonna fall short so yeah I Would have the credit\nBoth sides of the ball for for doing things when they had to when they had to get it done\nFinal thoughts up coming on the fifth quarter post game show will take a break come back wrap things up on the other side you're listening to the fifth quarter post game show all news radio five

the fifth quarter first game show on the home of the best game caught coverage news radio five sixty WBRC South Carolina with the wind twenty seven twenty four over the Tennessee Volunteers a Rocky Top was topped tonight there it is I got worked out when Justin Hall\nTim Frisbee here with you for these last few minutes before we wrap things up here a with a four and three records or seven games in South Carolina season\nBoth of us going with about a sea to see mine is kind of grade for South Carolina this year a defensively they've got to clean things up\nBut at this point I'm you are who you are I Can't really say much more than that um they've done a better job listen compared to what was happening as Missouri they've done a heck of a better job tackling these last two games\n[noise] oh yeah that that most definitely um you know even though\nA bit we're we're getting killed on the screen passes a law we weren't get really given up any huge place uh they were able to make tackles even when it got to the second level we're able to uh you know get a good tackle down and and get guys down to the field so that was a plus wind up you know\nIt's it's just something we had to do we talk about that from the beginning of the season where you have to get better a better on tackling and we have as the seasons gone along\nYeah I I feel like South Carolina's improved in some areas and then in some areas like forcing turnovers you can't really a change week to week what you do because like you mentioned you're playing to your strength you're playing do your talent level airplanes your experience level you can't ask a freshman like Jaycee worn to\nTry to play a flush with the wide receiver and keep it hips event and and trying to make a play on the ball and at the same time but it that's not their jumped out right and it's hard to do better than ...\nParents yeah comes with experience and uh uh it it it's instinctive and you only learned that with a with experience\nAnd that experience will come he's played as a true freshman he's playing all year he started all year as a true freshman ... that will pay huge dividends absolutely later into the season and the next\nSo South Carolina now says that foreign three old miss on the road next three of the next four South Carolina games are on the road\nOr you go to Oxford you go to games when you go to Clinton\nSo best for games left right now not counting the makeup game spore games like the best case scenario for South Carolina record was\nA I Believe and are the best case scenario uh over these next four games I Wish we would be going three in one but uh I I think that's the best case scenario well put it this way best case scenario for no but sure what we think is reasonable is ... is three and one\n... repeat that one more time what's reasonable reasonable it's reasonable to think is three and one that won last being Chattanooga right I'm getting I'm yes but the one last thing a devastating a probably a thirty forty point loss to Chattanooga but no they're the band [laughter]\nNo seriously though but I I think a jury in one would be the best case scenario in these last four games ah hopefully it would make the makeup gain\nYou know four and one of the I'm thinking more along the lines to into yeah but I just that that's a reasonable scenario yeah let her father's case it yet so best case is three and one of the I was likely thing to happen here we go there we go\nUm because I just think for what it's worth you look at the same on paper I don't think you can just assume that sacrament is going to go into Gainesville and get away as truth that and we won't even touch that last game um\nThat show too and she was the most random which gets you to six and five mhm with that make up game looming the next week after Clemson me out a little bit of something that Clemson game as well\nI'm just knowing that may not be the last game of the season and if you were to take another last like you have these past two years no one that's not the final taste in the mouth or for this team will do a lot for their confidence I feel like yeah ...\nYeah ... absolutely you know especially if especially if that game is going to be the game it's going to get people eligible it would really be a plus but ah but yeah if you if you go into that game adding to what you what could happen to you in the polls adding to a better bold and yeah they put some or an extra emphasis on that game\nYeah South Carolina there the first thing they have to do is ... ... they got to go down the Oxford and I got to take care of business at uh the grove ... volt Hemingway stadium at eleven am local time and and so uh noon kick off our time you're on the east coast\nSouth Carolina's gonna look try to get the five and three on the season which and I remember one five and three used to be real nice\n... there used to be really good [laughter] five and three used to be really good years not any more not any more people are still very upset right now in the social media that if you take a look people are still very upset at some things that happen tonight on the football field and that's fine\nYou have the right to be that there are things we can improve on a there are things that South Carolina can improve on I should say and that we feel they can improve on is how I should have worded it um\nDefensively just trying to keep everything in front of you every time tendency ran outside I kept going ... ... ... ... didn't you could see it developing poorly for soccer one's defense in terms of their positioning so I'm often simply catch the ball I as long as I can only catches the ball I feel like they're they're really\nOften yeah so that's just the things you didn't

its billing everybody I've talked to watch is loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with\nWith the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that they they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame so\nIt it there's there's plenty to

Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nNow it seems like they sort of invited at the same time\nIt helps 'cause we're thinking about the the witches and found that they're not just practicing religion they're also you know\nPeople their own shop there all along you know there are some kind of steak and the economy of Salem\nWaiting for that [laughter] yeah\nSo on and it's kind of like a little bit offensive but on the other hand brings people into your shop that's uh net win for them so this is again really complicated to like a fascinating degree the whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here and what are you doing you know that exactly that\nAfter they get the money anyway so then it did show you mentioned that that you know because of it being Halloween town it it it has been in because the the the sheet shift you're aspect of\nOf witchcraft 'cause it was perceived back then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know we're will and goes and and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town and then also part of that they're kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys over there\nEither by forming the actual street performers or as visitors\nUm the point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies\nIn Salem you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with you know universal studios and some others in Hollywood and other places you want to go to the um horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well if it has all these facets that kind of tired of them are dark I guess the ... the common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with Jay W Oscar a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for probably the tears in St Louis or\nThe sale of built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... well not the country at the time before leaving the country\nWho spent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing right because there were so good that trade overseas and of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff\nThat you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories to most of the east coast for all the kind of pirates out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of failing to have like I said earlier like to do the layers above just being the site of a trial and back in sixty nine to to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to write it means a series but still those trials it was just fascinating to\nTo talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused inside or you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... eventually let out of jail that it's kind of you if you can test and said yep was really sorry about that then you go but it's the only people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been to which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them did anyone\nI didn't write that ... avenue on the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life and it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's critical if it's a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing\nAnd by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population you said under about fifty thousand but of balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween or ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just it's like it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but as this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the Woodstock but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and throw happens their biggest one is October which will never go I\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open so I I I Would never have guessed their shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but the other but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened up the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round of film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want the truth is just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that it actually actually around the only other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over on that people are like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not in front of a bar in federal party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the wishing our\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] really that there\nWere they got to get them up before the ... or maybe the two and the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list things do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list\nOf things that are not a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween are starting on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast am All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget the men from the train next and coast to coast am this is Ian ...\nThen they need to do\nWas\nKnow somebody being bullied online\nWritten into\nHad council before you get caught up in I think your ears into some clarity Mark LeVine news radio five sixty telling you the\n\nPlace it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I study and one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy and proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the\nThe or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result\nIn somebody not getting a fair trial this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose means\nSeem\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the sense is right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily\nIn it at one point by the way this is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail\nAnd Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story\nOf the men from the train [noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is it allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime before death I interviewed I'm a true crime\nLegend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham that not run for your life [noise] uh all because of a\nStory seemingly that had been told about\nA Jewish philanthropist George Soros\nWe need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen or these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not wading into a debate but who is responsible\nFor today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experiences on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happen not everything is die hard to\nThat everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about it in fact the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty\nOf some thing stay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian ...

I had told my daughter\nThat ... if you walk the crimes back when you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would cover his tracks so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series\nSo uh we do is just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this\nBut we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that\nIt is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five\nThe ah I think that he while he use an ax to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something\nThat he would use if somebody was awake and could product to um [noise] but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\nTo get back to some of the ... of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do\n... ... ... what did you hope to learn\nAbout the human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to coal lead all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\nTheir what their general answer the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of our ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost\nAnd greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but they're they're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we\nWe don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of our cells\nThat we are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm\nObsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read what the real crime it with the real world leader a it's a book by um that's why it's a way to Weinstein I could have a lifetime or\nUh the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a it'd be\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is what America Walker who was a an avid reader crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens we're going to have them at an avid reader crime stories or Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid reader Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports to me I actually I live in the sports world for the most part that sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand that but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive thing [noise]\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories as this will pick it up the men from the train discovering most America's most elusive serial killer and there's one story or two here you need to know about before you go to bed at ... am Suzie and this is\nBeing by your voice with Alexa or a lot of these other types of things\nStill visa is preparing for a time when paying doesn't mean reaching for a card in your wallet and with that brings the risk that these in its brand will be invisible so it's developing ways to make sound a part of the brand customized sure\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that I\n[noise] you're you're fading out I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no can have that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime at night\nThey are saying that crime stories are very good because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate and taught poll entry into the subject\nEither got hooked like a ...\nUh I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders in Boulder, Colorado a call ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing with you that it's relatively ...\n... murders are a part of a series so I started I was just going to put an hour and who\nAnd who's trying to learn more about the ferries but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is is that true crime [noise] you know the tradition for\nTrue crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution and they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk and I became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought well heck this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early best selling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities may be this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were things that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a great great\nAunt had been was one of the victims of the crime Internet here always believed\nThat uh uh the man who\nAh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nLater that he had gotten away with it\nAnd he said that reading it in my book bag\nAnd our book that uh um it wasn't that we're not actually what had happened with just a tremendous relief correct yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that but it was it was a shame that he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a\nA random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go I understand for the understanding that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I\nI I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it [noise]\nYeah I think we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about it is all all book all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book here is trying to get people to understand the America and with these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that the ... that these murders occurred in\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from man\nI Am and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a whether the ... or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live a ...\nPeople\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happen to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night\nAll of the things that that happened to you happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture unfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they would die terrible Beth\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live in and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nYou didn't very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that just the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere and the tone for the um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I didn't really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and ... what is it that always sticks with me that oath trait that point you were just banking and that has to do with the\nThe soccer in the case of soccer and then that it uh one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors\nAnd an Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty second or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them the a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right\nThat would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago except that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us do you think could lead to the ... Iowa I'm and did the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to\nTo give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on a night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers in Russia where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his role as a matter of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but in some of it it's still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because

by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to lean toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit I'm so practical theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to be thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\n... that's ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime\nWas a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nIt's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse as young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and\nI don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and here that he had suffered terrible abuse and it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense a justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia peace or ... especially abusing the corps if that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know do some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book because a lot of things we don't know about a year or have you you're going to have no after you're gonna have a speculative after it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of climbing and\nI'm preparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much which respect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder it wasn't that like a nice guy and he said he is his the documentation of his life around around the time with the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a tanker pretty openly they are but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nThrough in about a life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they they just you know the ... thing and and they they they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um [noise] it it didn't have any charm it was not it was ... a ... generally as a charming\nRight ... and well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that\nMaybe he was he was a true psychopath\nOr psychopathic have no fear ... known norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing with a parent about this the ... and the training that from his crime is it ... it was not even not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book\nAnd and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about a this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't\nWe don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity\nSo we moved on and part of the book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also does quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw in a strange question

a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned is being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ... longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they good to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks at a\nBill I got a couple of questions the first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence ... like one of the act\nOf every what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and uh has been definitively guide to the to the murders than the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right ah do you know what this palm will Gary by any chance\nNo way down it disappeared even ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the world road because he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but uh they can for being on the air and I appreciate your story\n... that he actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed\nA if a ... and if it happens a lot actually up there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that he threw a lotta stocking but uh the just war himself into the frame of mind that he could get where you needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get them to these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so he he ... his punished crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight he did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to\nA trail forming behind him and place followed his where he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was his job as white used to railroad he always always used at the intersection of two railroad so\nThey were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance a year you'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to compare\nLet's enjoy watching that really forgot what it was you\nKnow that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to to like Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh wait or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after Nineteen away he started just morally more or less trapping it he became a Nineteen Nineteen awake and I can have a transition to just\nRunning loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know it's him as the lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there's a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that is\nA guy little was accused of than it was a robbery and and it yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty or Ninety five and his first crime he just drop the actor and left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they act in a bucket of water before leaving at the end the crime they did that and ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers knew what was going on or see a but it just a drop the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing a if he once he was out of the house he was\nUnconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat it still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean if there's any occupation where somebody could walk around with an axe that would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up on mine\nBut they all ... among them or did he work as a matter but then there are some of the I think he did at the accidents\nThat he used word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an act that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house and I see murders were uh were houses burn wood times\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up\nWhen you donate your car to the Purple Heart foundation\nSome people still think an education from northern Virginia

something or other\nAnd I'm not sure but the date sounds pretty familiar war or the arrow this one this was going on\nThere was a hobo camp or in a train yard in Chicago and ah [noise] along the shore on this one particular train ride like came in and out of this yard um\nThey had four or five of these uh ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed\nAnd they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd I do is I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTotally ... you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not covered actually Cleveland the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after\nA while I was hired to try to solve a series of a\n... and I'm a ... named by which the yet right\nCrime series is known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of the crime that some like in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... if they were\nThey were acts murders there were connected to train\nThe but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that here's what I'm I I I I knew the case you speaking of ... and that's what's become the public\nWould have to go to public safety officer or a public safety commissioner of Cleveland after Chicago um and those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this

Borden she killed her ... she if she did it she used to play to the acts and you said the other guy used the blunt end so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if you're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then\nYou know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell all types of stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about him later he just\nBlew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was getting idea when you buy but ... that's a really big on the first crime everybody\nKnew everybody knew what he looked like it it was a very unusual looking man but for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of\nThem and posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era the it was ... it was commented dude drawings of criminal in that case there are drawings of\nThe a police inspector who was in charge of
