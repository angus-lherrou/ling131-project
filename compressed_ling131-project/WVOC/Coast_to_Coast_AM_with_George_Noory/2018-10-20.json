colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us\nNational security adviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria it violated the criteria of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War cause the Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly headed commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the stock a chain exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seats\nIn Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crimes we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at it because\nYou know hit at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow pool in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that who is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliance of evil so why why should we\nAside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um\nCovert action you know I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators and which do things just come out alive and they they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interest\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for your time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick us up

in space our satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to you know put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do well there are rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nI knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of\nChina and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor your own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things um uses the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that ah they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pond in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\n[noise] I'll ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there was there or dominoes at play here obviously and wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nYeah but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably you know it's been cut down a few notches here recently especially with [noise]\nYou know the so called Davos and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these ah donors in investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course\nNow they could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course their their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... are they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about 'em but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression and Richard a friend of my enemy is a you know my friend or something like that that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous\nA game that they are playing we see that evolved over the years in Iraq we see it in Syria [noise] you know even you know ... and I would just welcome a president Sisi of you\nEgypt up and to Moscow for his fourth visit in the last couple of years and you know they may big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... uh so these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we banned in the ... now\nI'm you know they will run into the arms of putting in putting understands that uh or into the arms of chi into a certain degree that's\nHappening I'm you know we have to recognize and the dark side of the world very bad things happen uh our our own

lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis days with is the book is a lines of evil Russia China the United states\nAnd a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived there had been\nA ... obviously some older patients with the Russians are particularly\nUm uh well I wouldn't call them Russian regular troops these are more like mercenaries in Syria the United states has certainly encountered or had heated battles with them a there have been some near collisions in the south China Sea was Chinese vessels how do you see this\nOr what is the the danger of this breaking out into all out war and perhaps as you point out morphing into the unfathomable uh the end and then time scenario\nWell certainly the confrontations or on the uptick current Richard you know we had one here recently with the U.S has a done Decatur destroyer\nOr in the grave and race in the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of be fifty two federal flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers with the practice from that these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nNext door to them it's really in the middle of it to see but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades are so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or of the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said or they use your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but there were there to represent the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians\nWhite their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any and time scenario or is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into says ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog a mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow of fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of\nThe Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThat these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with the Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together uh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives and the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up through the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the U.S for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians are they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late a they even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med\nFrom the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere\nSoon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having nuclear capability and I think that's what era one wants to Austin in like\n... it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fad to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam make a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nIf there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the ... and I think that you find that they're not involved with the who these are not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia in Riyadh in Iran is going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas in\nPalestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going on but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another fallout from that or a positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the ban low stairway will open up the

important\nUm you will see a your life are all these different events that you choose to one that one would ever you could get to pick because you can pick\nAnd your guy will advise you well um you could use some of that life\nUh and yes you do get to choose and um you you when you do me a kind of issue is your soul family that may have been a switch 'em or they switched roles uh depending upon what they're learning experiences are\nSo you can come back with a several of the people that you've been a living or incarnate it from a previous life\nHere's the problem I have sort of philosophically with without a and is it possible that we in reincarnate I suppose I ... I don't happen to believe it that's just me but here's one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example\nA to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and pleasing men but we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person had to learn from [noise] then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave\n'em I I I understand that when when the child is young but there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents ... and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well\nAnd usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them that this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero and their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guys\nAll right Joe thank you for that a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\nYes thank you for taking my call Richard\nUp three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a roof\nOh yeah ...

colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts group and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War\nHas the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers\nOr this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter\nTowards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nUh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nThis year as Jimmy hendrix taking us into the break with voodoo child on coast to coast am\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the eight\nI think of it as well general election is Amr here election days have Emmerson\nFollow these practical path for night rise yourself with the voting system review your sample ballot and pregnant with me and uses a guy

poll from Gallup suggests support for nebulous gun control remains high and about sixty one percent\nThat's down modestly from when the pollsters asked the question in the weeks following the Parkland
