all I could remember was Victoria ... from the ... valley\nYeah exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was there a pound and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that in James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going\nI literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it and I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead\nAnd she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said\nHuh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go that you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I Hope that one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo

being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ...\nWhore house he says and and that and I helped you know we\nWork on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy\nDo I have a bone to pick with you\nAnd he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies had nothing to do is go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold person I says why did you even do that it's like people just do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of that I don't

both ways positive negative\nNext stop we go to rolling in Springfield, Ohio east of the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way today we are fine thank you hope you are to\nA Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local like\nI'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over that person I work with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go not a well I just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well I guess well you might as well get up\nMove around on adults as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and now like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with a bow little while and um they all wanted to go to a bar\nProbably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh\nI was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something\nHere exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real aren't comfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country\nAnd it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and it was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that hard enough and the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it doesn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three is no warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us on the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places\nEarlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people and and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was uh our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because the guy is a this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him and I said yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like\nWow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept\nI just kept that that bothers the lord and\nJesus in my heart which we have these dreams Myers about nothing is going to be stronger than the the liked it in me\nWhat do you think that are

um\nI you know I'm a or a present right power now guy yeah\nRight and it's it's all happening now it's all here interesting take\nYeah the future is it is a construct and so um when we talk about prediction we're looking at possibilities that are happening uh in the present moment\nSo and that way if projects\nWhen we talked about the ducks card I learn from you sense that that doesn't necessarily mean one is going to die\nI beg to differ I beg to\nDiffer you you think now means someone's gonna die\nAbsolutely absolutely because you\nKnow I always thought it was maybe death of a

don't know [laughter]\nYeah that's but that's true with all the cards in the ...\nWhy would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately [noise]\nUm well well it's a great question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist say I'm death is certain but at the time of death is our number right\nRight so I'm In in in keeping with say the Tibetan book of the dead the understanding of being aware of the reality of gas\nAnd living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a
