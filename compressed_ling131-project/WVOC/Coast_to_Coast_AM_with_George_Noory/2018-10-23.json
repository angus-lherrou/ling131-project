to stop and they reflect the failed states over there there's not going to be any reduction in foreign aid coming from Trump that great a stump speech but it's\nNot going to happen Congress as the one

O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those places there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet\nWhy there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around now\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic\nEngineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara foreign within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you as soon as I as a and they bring us back\nA rumble set a tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort what I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launched companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and uh because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign

countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise]\nI'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they\nI mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um they can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again I'm\n... there's a new paradigm now and ... these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can to you in one third the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nOr if you're going to be a first class power much right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons uh the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that well yeah well the ... states that one weapons\nOkay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be a the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know the ... the once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nA fake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not to feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows uh\nThat you know the next new kid on the block me a ... you know knocking on Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space\nTravel [noise] um [noise] well um we could\nI mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so we're supposed to talk about the office after I listen to your show [laughter]\nAnyhow hey I'm\nI'm enjoying the show the light of it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering when we get there if we find someone and tell us your life do we really have the right to invade like the American to be like a Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there uh-huh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay\nAll right well here's the thing um\n[noise] there there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay they may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no buys in herds there are no red woods there's\nJust a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there but nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks or nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I think that at the rate that space X is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nOr it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims that people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nIf you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not [noise] um but\nUm\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on

northeastern section about while\nHe has a graduate degree in political counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nBuy got shot at a clinical therapist get involved in those studies [laughter]\nUm well actually I was interested in a very psychology before I was actually a clinical ah actually I actually got it and then I studied psychology and goes\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah I spent a lot I'm at the casino in Detroit we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way not very well\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight went to the apple was for a year in at that time it was just the booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing they're\nGood teamed up their sports\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just starts\nAnd all the studies boy he was an overview of what you've been doing\nWell um\nYou know I ah I have a degree in Paris psychology a when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically at the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kinda got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining ghostly encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as to lose the nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who were looking for things are books with more than just go stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these ghosts I've been taking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's when I came up with some of these new theories\nAre and that's what I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is it's out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould've you concluded to brag about what the grossly experience might be for real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to my encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal ... electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there is some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\n[noise] so what do you think causes the one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes\nSo that's a inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of goes link counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em\nAre coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of it goes and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um\nI think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think\nIf we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event\nUm and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of there's a lot of\nThings that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else and and a great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of my\nAunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a Taliban distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans may and you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nFor free with the coast zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n... review on my heart

the child and the mom\nSaw this woman dressed in future at the ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something we're even skier due to\nUm personally no I haven't been scared that budget I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise] oh one morning a\nNew my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and that was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take your shower and go to work and don't worry about it and I'm like you know when I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this so I open the door the dog and me and went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nI started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond\nAnd somehow um you know drowned in there by\nYou know I dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I tend to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling or that desire to go outside\nBut something happened and I kept asking myself\nWhat what happened what made that day different and was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brendan because the person who\nDied comes back\nNever had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghostly encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like a staff of a father or something\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death or there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ... this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nOf the huge no yeah yeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nThe process of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased it could help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to those these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of the loved ones death after these operations\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive\nUm they can come out of a ghostly encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is um something to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like that\nAnd what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations ... what's so special about\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em\nThere's there's some test out their specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnets you show\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that saying that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes and eat jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels\nSo there's some sort of objective evidence that they can detect\nMore than other people and the general population you know and this is true for what we we all experience differently right and they've shown that throughout as well so you know I might get\nOh with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that it\nDoesn't

know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nYou know there's a there's still some colleagues who come up demand go you know I don't tell me a story but then they've you know follow it up with but you can't do any water or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if it's something
