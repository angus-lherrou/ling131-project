you know this looks like it made it finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that I'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push is gravy train for businesses\nIt ... is the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and I\nDon't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now\nOr at best Trump holds\nOn notice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history

in two thousand eight\nWill be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics or

eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of

young people with the next generation coming up buying so when we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the ...\nTeaching baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens when a regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this and the zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the bleeding to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot tourists let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona they get things started with us I'm Peter\nRight hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk it too but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that and we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack\nAhead of ours this time is it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits\nAnd we're going to kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go the keys in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars in for the hurricanes struck and because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having had a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people last not happening up here ah\nIn New York former Empire State\nAnd secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist\nOn taking their short sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run that city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say\nThis bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote and herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that's kind of a good thing we're in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing powers has how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike Harry with us for coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on the coast to coast

E. R.\nNow George thinks that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kind of think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic\nI'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few lick then because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path that I I Do\nThink I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our above all going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to bail pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on and we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing and the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will hit that I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad\nBut the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say that but if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made\nWall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited mainstream\nAll the reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend that rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or they you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I I'm typing in my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's ... what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to X procreate money or pull accounts they're gonna do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor telling you how can you think you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question but the Afghan\nA direct it might not even one of my parents were flying a light up I'm like oh hey humiliate CONMEBOL combat line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding gloomy economic I'm tired of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits off some of the larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting so those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say\nHave as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't\nPledge those reserves in little that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time here ... website it goes to goes damn dot com psychiatrist looks at the paranormal\n\n\nRene or anything in just six landlocked states are suing ... is denial of permits for coal terminal at the long view is the ability of coal producers in Wyoming and Montana to get up to two point five million tons of coal to Asian markets here's Montana as attorney general temple\nYou cannot discriminate against commodities once they cannot discriminate against another stage commodities in this way\nWashington state leaders the environmental laws allow them to protect their residents from negative impacts\nThey claimed the terminal would affect water quality local traffic and increase cancer deaths but at the heart of the lawsuit will be trying to show Washington leaders are biased against coal democratic governor Jay Inslee wrote and a two thousand seven book quote coal is killing us he ran for office promising to not allow coal terminals\nAnd recently announced a lawsuit against the Trump Administration over Colby missions a federal judge in Tacoma recently denied Washington's motion for dismissal in Seattle dance Springer Fox News\nHe is had many close brushes with that as well starting in the womb yeah you said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams out of body experiences encounters with message burying the operations as\nWell welcome to the program Dr many may just on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people ask me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that that um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but the um term near death experience you know it's quite a bit talked to him in ... in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nI think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my clothes brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls that that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first um couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transpired mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um like transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because\nIt's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight eventually they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now the person who gave me the transplant she lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact mhm and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow [noise] so he was flown back into that don't you send in Washington DC\nAnd a team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine of ...\nHave you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did say my lines and they hear altruism you know\nHe said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor to drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab ... that's it yeah that that she thought to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang\nAnd then I'm ... years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells and they gave him these injection for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just saw\nNot too long ago in Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist\n[noise] however since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that\nAnd these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post staff contact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and agnostics have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you and agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of decisions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of psychic experiences such as ESP\nAnd collect the theory extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right or is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability\nThey're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying ... the\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth and um the AG could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images I Try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to to let the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to a lot of the when they were under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us

little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely calm and don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're throwing you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them\nAnd they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting [noise]\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people received messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we could say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear\nMhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr news there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know how they're dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how did we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I thought\nI I just saw these words that said this is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the\nIdes of march [noise] that's right and in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with ... favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nExactly and how many times has that happened\nOh [noise] that say the majority of people don't pay attention to that because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing in ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe it they don't believe and also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors nurses um what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctor pie and of course the doctor was founded\nThere was another case or the plantation to left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was ... everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put a statute\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wild yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical their mysterious Israel different words that have been used to describe the same event but I think paranormal\nEvents can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every parent normally there but some do and of course it depends on the Christian he's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our teen nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make is we're going to take phone calls your coals you your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou've heard us talk about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am dot com [noise]\nWith the ... byline leaning on Bradley Cooper\nOf star is born Cooper call

caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\n\n\n\nOkay\nWell come back to our final hour with Dr many made us we're talking about his work the borders of normal as a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether a person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference Manny\n[noise] well the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone hearing voices certain qualities that would distinguish the psychic psychotic experience for example if someone here the voice [noise]\nUm yeah psychotic ... nation tends to be very very frightening it's also a frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides boy it could be a town of machinery\nAnd in fact it may be more than one voice to uh the voices talking to each other about the person might be a accusatory or threatening where I'm psychic aloof nation and to be in the Clinton\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming thing is with fake ...\nYou can't just look at when him and his hearing the voice you have to look at a whole person because say the major mental disorder which affects the ability to function in society\nId whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the least nation for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings of ...\nThat people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nAnd you make a misdiagnosis is conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAhah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... there were admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients knew that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors could do that\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true [laughter] but but the patients didn't\n[noise] that's right because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls here for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake in had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have like my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they did all the major planning for their European front\n... well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little\nAnd there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not who's ... and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there\n[laughter] what'd you do that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I was out of the body travel [noise] and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more Nineteen sixty seven sixty seven\nYeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy [noise]\nI don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you were weight\nWhere I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter] oh ... the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay\nBetween sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you're in that particular place of knowing what all income they sing love is and what I was during meditation or we think and\nI could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive light and the whole screen\nOf my vision was filled with is glittering youthful different colors of worrying shouldn't yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\n... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when they're just I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I\nThe last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nA regional thing I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called with the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of visions because I'd been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life\nOr whether they're able to function or whether is an illness that's interfering with their life so it you can make a diagnosis or just on the basis of the fact that a person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia\nBecause someone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions and you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to the actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia\nAnd they can also be lists nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of pain\nAnd other dark\nAnd places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nYou think she's doing it on purpose\nI think so I think they must be a reason why she is going to those places\nTo go to Joe in Monterey, California Joseph go ahead\n[noise] a dying to charge a doctor matters are you a breath of fresh air and let me tell you thank you um

in terms of psychic fairs I don't go to say take those but I have attended um international conferences on science and spirituality and I do find that when I'm with like minded individuals\nAre these types of experiences are more common\nYeah that that I could see that happening\nWell for one thing you feel more accepted and you feel more able to talk about what's going on\nYou know you feel
