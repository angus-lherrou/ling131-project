I mean she was ... extremely high profile um um UN and ... in part because she was a you know governor of a state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the uh you know the Trump you know kind of foreign policy line\nTo AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs the investment for\nWell I mean not only was she ... this administration she was with the Bush administration ...\nYou know she started up and turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of ...

and brighter type folks I think Haley was an outstanding UN ambassador\nAh and I think she just had enough of it I think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button have all the time so I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that you might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean she completely back you know the Trump White house and we have a ... wouldn't mind seeing

world after they pass on to the body the person taking them\n... it's just a disaster gotta be careful Google Plus I don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus from so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWas going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy her latest book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this breach that occurred\nWell I'll say right at the top ah they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during a as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical possibility but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable aware like name and email address no credit card number is no financial information nothing like that a lot of that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go we're experimenting with other things\nAnd I mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of cocoa puff which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head using a that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially\nUh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably not a good idea and the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the time that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that norm is growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke what did you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a wall upped yeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of\nMessages to the troops the kind of try to cheer them up uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to grow\nA that's that can happen when you're trying to grow rapidly you know ... you can live off the ball and you can really uh fall flat later on whether or not snapshot steps that will be able to pull out of this I I don't know

work in into upside down thinking\nMarch ... ... what did your peers say in your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nAnd it's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I told people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell the ... cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nYears ago during the television days though they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would ... audience members to and then they show videotapes of various anchor people\nAnd ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I found in my research in that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present their oath in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in ... people have that ability growing up\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done it looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event\nThat we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of\nNine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a gambler you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said dollars trickery its magic\nBut do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of spoon bending parties which sounds ridiculous but I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nMetal for example and early ... as an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller ... then and\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real um but a side note on your a gal her very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier there's another document that I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context\nOf remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say in a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous matter\nWell yeah there has been a lot about him but the documents suggest that study it around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the ability that maybe he was able to get things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out your website and where people can get your book\nSure my website is my name mark over and they are gay G.

and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought that up to ... this is a really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it give that into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having a look at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies so this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever started hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... a party at from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that the ...\nIn cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body in verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be the defender later and we know that that's happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the time were being stamp and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinct it's down and yet this person came back in describing found in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make that according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experience memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual study that the med school had looked at the very closely and Dr Bruce scraping his one person in particular\nWas look at these phenomenon and it is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat such an important point I think we\nTend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver\nOf the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientists you're doing an incredible drama on this topic\nYou've learned a lot habit you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than I materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and he's in uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious as goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universal I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nBack chemically the brain\nAnd therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches but going back to psych ...\nIt can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part of the same one question is Alzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious as the mines dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments\nWe know there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is\nThat correlation does not always imply causation\nIn other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way where the brain is highly related to consciousness\nDamage the brain you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen ... what do you think mark reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes there are five by medical records by the use the professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life and in some cases the medical records are found\nSo it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical\nSomething else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead Hi\nGeorge and why I have a question for your gas sure how\nI thank you for a ban on the show\nSo I'm back in two thousand and one I experience [noise] I tell the comment was set and there was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic it just isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing but it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs because you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic will believe if you find the proof [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWith friends and workmates the researchers found that yes the hug is a drug\nHe was no surprise that on the day of a conflict people described an increase of negative emotions and the decrease in the motions but among\nPeople who said they received a hug at some point during the same day as the constantly those recipients report in a smaller increase in the negative feelings into smaller decrease in positive emotions\nThe research and said this study is not fully

don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that um the Dow is there and I've seen it with three

never seen what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw it when I never did before but I saw two\nYeah so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to\nWhen the rain\nThompson within\nWithin you know maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that feeling yeah\nThey can feel it it's it's they're reading comic but to the to the to the to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here now there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well\nWe haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field of physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest that anything could travel and yet here we had an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do tactically\nThis has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion of interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book in into upside down

chronicles stories from the role of the unknown the unexplained it'd be unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic trench medium for as far back as she can remember\nChoose communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which obsessed with Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult ...\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years\nMore has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very\nA a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned and the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is a Salem and seal off and when I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed and her her garb and very regal looking very\nUm you know she's a big prize on for a person and ... at\nThe time people welcome or with open arms you did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question the you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it you know go to ... um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you said the civility what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's\nInteresting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought the girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talked to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it did it seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she'd come my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties he finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirit but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite\nThought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grandma right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that\nKnow she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever passed down stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know\nThe only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and that she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that\nYou know ... that was her true so she was very unique that what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand and one would use that\n\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he started this story after and uh near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing you know he goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but\nIt's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go on to the night you know someone else doesn't really want to see why look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown all you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years Iran and the team um that worry you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and they're they're just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified\nWe're off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we have done more than a hundred and investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\n\nWell I think there are varying degrees\nOf what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to get before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like\nSay a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nYou know door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have\nSomething go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know\nMy phone's been ringing with all their oath on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all the things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes I'm thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I\nTalked to use them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm\nElite run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knew any dragged me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful\nYou know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know it's there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering my\nBest friend she and he\nSaid and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nTo hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary hey we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast\nColumbia hope on a

lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen you might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies a poet and we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat

got about halfway down the the side of the ... you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came and they didn't want her to mention anything so I I stopped and waited for a night I served continually walk all the way to the door\nAnd I waited and waited and yet nobody came in so finally I said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no and there and oddly enough that ... is with the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard report she and women walking on the wall in that same
