day we're talking about friday the twelfth of October\nA woman and the mother and wife are in similar Barry Connecticut got up at six AM she was standing in her bathroom\nAnd suddenly realize that there were bright lights being shown on the floor of the bathroom which are flabbergasted or because uh she lives out and about an acre of rural land forested land there shouldn't have been any lights on our bathroom floor\nShe walked in the window and looked up\nAnd to use her term was George tour utter shock and amazement she saw a rectangular craft with eight rows of lights running down the vengeful surface of it moving over or how slowly\nHeaded for a row of trees and within thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her said\nYes she did hear a home and that raises the specter of a possible blimp\nWe haven't checked on blimps yet but it very interesting report\nPosted to our website and her illustration of what she saw on the bottom of that craft is posted to our home page

wings couldn't see a tailor windows\nAnd he pulled it it was so intriguing and he pulled his car off the roadway and share and looked at it\nAnd it was at that point he realized that it was

with me today so let's ask him Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two silver was four dollars an hour to near it's caught to production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible though\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHoops you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... one could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate about anything that you can set up to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George running to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred and one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip cool yes nuclear combined let's get Lee or sky high\nSilver report in some fascinating report it don't miss out on the ... revolution goal now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation go one\nEight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nSeven Daniel full floor yard sales going on now with incredible deals the lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on seal up to fifty\nPercent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin would look limited flooring Poland seal up to forty percent off\nRefinished hardwood bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNo gruesome video on demand TV channels complete can do to do the best movies and you as a ... inch conspiracies suppressed science called us all access us moody all access is now living in the Amazon site groomed us ... dot com and download ...\nMillion I go to you as ...\nDescribed no universal access across all devices that us on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nHow do you know the real joy supposed to be some some lobster\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what three on with us and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV like about oh how magicians are pulling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate like really really bad and it looks like we're all\nDoing trickery of some ... I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving their reading any questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of uh what you are receiving\nThe retailer on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers are others who\nAre critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed him down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick because many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down the frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] choice to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was a I was really good at that but you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought it was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent and those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of\nOut of the third dimensional way of thinking it's so restrictive and limiting no into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interest or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be in growing in a consciousness so they kind of\nA digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month in days\nTo have a birthday and birth name possible short they're asking about um I saw a man to a lot about love and romance\nAnd try to keep each call too by the minute nap for ... she came out this does not have so many people\nWill cut it short will try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other\nPlanets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say Dr believe in reincarnation and have to say a variation of it and the churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're related disorders\nAs a psychic or anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhat you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them are you picking up ... feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going to the cemetery I don't like the energy there and people who are lose loved ones and they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they wanted to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving\nProcess is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know about grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about right and\nAbout that we can wish them well if they go into the light God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents\nWe're big cemetery ... hours as I was growing up it's not a good work [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that would have returned a lot you know and I found myself a cemetery great you know growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a Marshall am driving through Greenwich cemetery and my mom to think we should\nGet one of those oh I think they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here don't play no they're not going to stay here\nAs I started crying and what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very enlightening\nI thought it was like a house so I thought they were going crazy [laughter] you know if

they mean the color than the\nShaped very very important Georgia so again the earth you\nKnow I I Can't do the do you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yet he could see or

died\nYeah you gotta love Casey my bag [laughter] absolutely charged nor did I Will remind her\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call it power where'd you get it from\nI I don't think it's power I oh God that we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on a God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I try to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's actually afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she later we got the power from we all get our energy from its ally for us we get it from God at

that night and he said you know mom I'm fine [laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died he was lying on his side it's either I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I passed but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they call me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's to your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise]\nBut they do have a really I think we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but I I don't want people to think that too is that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so a suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicide\nSad stories are very sad yes don't do it

sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my coal dissociation\nWas an ability to travel beyond the body travel in consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army and so we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst mine does the bulk

that invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it one of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk\nTo a wise itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality in throughout the world we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nWhere we're leading parallel live this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survived physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the old bubble up from the U.S no subconscious\nNot sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitation some people who come cooling those people to come calling my including clued but loving family members or incest as a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of known local mine but science tells us about we get in the\nInformation field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also proud of this is that we are definitely a time travel is anybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future\nCan ... the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this my mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out now the reality is now the time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience is papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we didn't dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking\nQuite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect this to a deep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest sold so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience because dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows with our actions in attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience\nHave lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams\nWhat makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple fall step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes to get some help ... feedback in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it I mean there's good times ... of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nIt's not new to sit and show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates his death ... accidents by coming back from dream forecasts but it's happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheel that coming down the hill to fall on the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction but time travel but time doesn't move in a new one direction and in fact\nYou understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place than in between place\nFrom which we can

card to get used to do I need to stay here in my house I start to get more than your free\nAnd here's the reasoning that so I'm getting on a plane somewhere and I actually say when I arrive at the airport I don't actually need a news story today because the best stories sometimes up when something goes wrong I really just what the mood trip\nAt lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and not have up there when I can hear me read paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting\nHe looks at me and he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe that her but I cold she'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer\nAnd something drew me to him he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to a certain goal is to a certain place might even be an\nAge and just sit and ... but as I'm telling it it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking for waiting you around the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check orders play you know when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs\nAnd the open to something more positive coming into your life\nIs there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important like the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind and that ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that at the heart of matter of reality is a dense of consciousness so\nThat there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's a phenomenon that used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time ... example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nAnd there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gosh are my blood is they're going to have you lived in pants\nAnd after that I competed common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen can but the white queen screams before\nShe picks her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually ... thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure too and in that it forward took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment onto the patriots symptoms he says but I couldn't possibly be reported people think I was looted you well you know I think so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we know the thing\nWe know what the bleep we know that we know enough about it you know so medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again remember your dreams are going to share them the right way to you and it could take action that will empower your life and brings them healing energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also a method of loosened dreaming you would call the ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and treatment venture\nIs to start out loose that elusive what does that need it means that we use so many drumming and the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream\nLet's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff's going on but getting back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean I'm going to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Morrow someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is the I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try lied state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psyche can intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state and make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive premium the method is also about dreaming with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs and symbols and the ...\nBut around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream and felt the misleading I think that I've been on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think that don't think the dreams in themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around but you can pick up pigments from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that it's truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find the behind something that's scaring worrying and you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the ... but a rush to interpret according to narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll

so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream well out of the stories in my new book mysterious reality is involved films passage into the afterlife and actually what\nHe might be doing now it's pretty interesting title but the part of it that it didn't the previous documentation is that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on Lake ...\nWhich was called ball and get out to the nearby village is living in another bowling on the other side of death and those closed
