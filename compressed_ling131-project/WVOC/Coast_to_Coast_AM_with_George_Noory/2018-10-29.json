newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell in this book about something called the winged man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\nOh yeah I actually that was in a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I was you know the area very well it's a large area\nLike places around the world that same should be hotspots normal phenomena kind of just saying you know that'd be coming out is areas where it seems every image brother you know ... times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had seen this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use\nOver the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe it said by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that sort of pops up is not seen again and just kind of I'm\nJust sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know who's the facts\nAnd then he'd never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one um it ... and I pulled Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington\nAnd I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with a huge wings but it was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me and how the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair and go combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... square patch and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than to men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign them at in black and one on the women and black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins live ... white white\nUm [noise] um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them pay for they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after paper being using wage boats which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe they ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits walking\nOn you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... you know you've got a really weird ones you next play a couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a power with the men in black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the\nGovernment agencies are responsible for that might be but I think it's a very small cats agree versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this is the\nOver the years agencies may actually unemployed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the maybe paper within governments who know that the men and black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the ... the most chafe resumes too\n[laughter] [laughter] I may not want to I've been talking about it so the government might not know the men in black really don't like to\nDo that sort of lead us into where we're heading into the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't

George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes like ... ... ... aliens but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had\nA governmental governments very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm over ... she was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact a papal now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote a book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly intriguing is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused cold day a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild man of ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most challenging and intriguing aspect is that he told the police so this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on gold of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts panel where the the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nSold him huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books with

all the research and the top of several books have been written on the subject there's no sort of one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened it's it remains\nYou know I'm ... but there

spirituality get on church religion\nNew religious movements electronic media and popular culture and is currently a professor of religion at Vassar College his new book other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions is a spectacular and mind bending a Christopher welcome to the program\nMorning George thanks for having me on the show\nThanks for staying up so late or ... I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experience is unusual states have consciousness religious experience to\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so [noise] yeah it is kind of the privilege to be could be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of all of my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that looked at sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know there's something new a new direction by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led a um a lot to at least a new vocabulary that people are you now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents and even after like experiments on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your life\nWork to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess what we call spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of participation in traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of a mystery and I wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual conceptions and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would more time\nTo ignore me George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know times lips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kind of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that would that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about\nUh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes\nYeah I'm going to another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are our three directions or or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimension [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality [noise]\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they buy incorporating an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact justice skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou have the song was named the eleventh greatest song by Rolling Stone on their list of five

worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific views came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah he and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and find the time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and [noise] his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher to mention it has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I'm hesitant in an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes off or he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make the right and the situation as he he raises map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nHe kind of hang on to that is the only sure thing that the way in which the map provide certainty onto him but I think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nI must say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nOther parts I'm In the timeline or other areas on the timeline so the dreaming self dreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat uh that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of scientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a\nHas a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nThe into the future and he writes is I just up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes get talked about this and different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that [noise]\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well also in that chapter sex I'm\nNot a little bit and the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on is as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time that just linear or something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that prime flows forward\nUm in fact though you know I find that a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nUm the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through [laughter] passing through that that block prior we occupy little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussion Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um fate and destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dream itself he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd done believed that I'm using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know hinting and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that as you know maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together [noise]\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that ah those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away like listen to the break\n[noise] no you can get show updates and connect with other ... would you joined the ...

all by the time to go to college but he also learn how to get to see them a lot of money on ... which is your story has a happy ending mess girl [noise]\n\n\n\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world and pull them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand uh the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional hum and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and I'm an avid spoke at flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects that insert themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people\nWho have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences them and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like\nLike all of us today I mean I think that we all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't\nHe didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to he went to sort of like popular science book um\nAnd I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept I'm\nA little I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah\nYeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right on ... reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity on and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in in the sixties and other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into\nAnother realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances or who's going to a gym to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there they're all different all different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a ...\n... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um\nYou know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat where fighting around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every every one in five when I can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flats where it gets pulled off of the two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three\nDimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat land we can see for the first time not just line that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside right say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he can even see inside the try like in the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nPeople have uses the say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right when raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look down on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out\nYou know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside that are ones you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use\nPeople still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just\nSettling but when you think about it
