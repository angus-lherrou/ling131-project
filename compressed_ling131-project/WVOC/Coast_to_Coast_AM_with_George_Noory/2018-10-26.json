red light on the a dorsal surface of the object\nVery interesting sighting after the first object Esau moved to the east towards Winston Salem reports he realized that there was a second one above it

Subaru observatories in Hawaii define planet nine invisible light and or infrared\nProfessor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than earth and just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update\nOn his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying\nTo mind and he told me that he is\nPlanning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune a good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus\nSo you deliberately going\nOn November first started another\nSurge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation\nThat can only be seen by American eyes in the winter here now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California\nIs astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky\nTo the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most to we have to wait until the solution is up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part do we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system the probation and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect\nOnce we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally\nFound this new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the cloud and you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet\nNot they were inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine tests are but then he got knocked out by Saturn or Jupiter like do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have cloud it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think is the object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter lightly or it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light games from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure 'cause we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nAre you Jonathan lush excited to tell you about the new give back Columbia program a group of local charities centerfield Julie warehouse supports donating a

coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and\nCan have devastating consequences\nRight now with our computer models showing to do is have you worked on the PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially\nWorse than even those theft estimates\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will\nOnly become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices than they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast around the Alaska Jude rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise forced to migrate as there's\nHippies become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get you in the such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo does that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the

global warming and sea level rise does continue\nThat in more than one million properties in Florida\nWell have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over

flooding on high tides that get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami is nonsense\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic had melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years\nAnd know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern tip of Florida will be

I Do not know this is an extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mentioned any of this parent to loved ones to children to parent\nNone they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility and things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and Fenway open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty great ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was in this dark bedroom was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling and slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming writes in my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination that I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glimpse passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with fish living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nThere were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... but they had the same texture in the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were Newman is at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like an downloading information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that we can being given to me it would just\nA ... that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain\nIt felt like to me it wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me\nBut I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I
