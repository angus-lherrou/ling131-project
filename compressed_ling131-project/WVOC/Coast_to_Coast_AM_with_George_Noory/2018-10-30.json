down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy what now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is that do\nNot buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing now and it's it's a real number on a five hundred\nMillion people that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half billion so so ... here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAnd the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shake it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well well it cooked himself because they're going to have essentially a quarter of a billion elderly it they've gotta support that can support themselves and now they they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right exactly they go to war\nThey well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China\nThis one and in China's history zero they've never won a war I I don't know what's going to happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a\nThey don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much to take some calls this hour come ruining here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just hear me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have look and see I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian\nBut I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things to you first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the wiring star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Ron and possibly win a presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys said and all they did was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and catch quite and\nWe had a president and did something so by all it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself businessmen and women don't have time for non Stan\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy death and win wars\nDiplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him out and be happy he said no nonsense is is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I'm no wars\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what scientists hard and other people know that ... I ... it it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nTurned let's get a little skittish comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would get anyone to jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or a toilet a pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works we we have the best country on earth we have the best system\nOn earth and the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know\nI I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just not areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat will do but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh\nDon't know I think what he has done his dignify but it is the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow what I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I\nMean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou're out for the big game not normally

from my perspective it's an exciting time to be alive it really is I I'm I'm enjoying this I think the best days are ahead not behind us I think the United states is going to see an economy that it doesn't understand and that that's going to be a just launched\nBy generation y that this monster generation that's fourteen to thirty three years old that it's going to start households and by dish soap and and by vacuum cleaners and furniture and automobiles\nLike the old days\nYeah I ... in talking to the you know I talked to all sectors and talking to my automotive sectors are cars that drive themselves are not going to happen\nGood good they're already killed several lady in Arizona for crying out loud\nYeah well in the trucking trucking won't touch it\nWell no I support our truck drivers I don't want to see driverless trucks and I really don't have\nEnough truck I you know what that what we\nWould you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers sitting\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have a mini mini as little tiny mini Cooper right\nI Am a corporate GDP which is a high rise and I'm thinking to myself if I the first time I pull up next to I'm a

out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whatever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please\nOkay one of the things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million\nOr um men are males or without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and uh it's ... there there is just a ton and and ... that that is what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major war breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking where we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles into guinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a king John hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I said I said what do you see in in Korea is going to be a unification\nOf the north in the south the you know that the south is not having children\nThere for heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know is is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north and the south I really don't North Korea is about ... their their rights that are just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coasts like Florida is now the third most populous state out raking New York state\nAnd also the Knicks has become the largest city out raking I filled out here people are moving to the warmer weather Bruce Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shift ahead we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada or a\n[noise] Arizona and a New Mexico um the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million while or buy real estate by in Florida now and just sit on it\nYeah instead of ... the the uh\nUh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist or give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to if you're not going to add on to say when when one of the big into\nYou know ... and I told I I said listen it hasn't started ...\nYou know when it does it's gonna be a huge\n... it's going to be off the charts what's the same thing that's happening with healthcare elder care and death care\nFor a Vegas is that a good market huge\nOff the charts huge can't believe it I it it's a for one uh it it's cheap there are plenty of jobs uh uh I go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas is is unbelievable\nSuper All right Ken thanks keep in touch with us so you're always welcome on the program skinny\nYou I I Love it take care man\nOkay be well his website linked up the coast to coast am dot com very easy to get to in his book upside of course that he just mentioned in the age curve on a profit from the coming demographic storm nice spot on his any it's interesting to talk with them about that next\nLet's dabbled with the paranormal for a couple of hours and don't forget Wednesday night goes to goes on coast to coast\nA neighbor ms detail of the show or a gift sign up for the ... ... email newsletters ... dot com [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is a laser Kaufman point and it it is my\nA rock and roll lovers is Sandy ... joined me for a Trenton back to this week and rock and roll history\nLet's start back in Nineteen sixty nine were David Bowie appeared at a Halloween Night at the general Gordon and grapes in English the gig lasted about Fifteen minutes after Bowie saying ... space oddity to everyone's delight and then he tried to store on stage along with a huge book and he sat there and read poems and he was booed off stage\nAlso this week in Nineteen sixty nine Elvis Presley wants to number one on the U.S singles chart with suspicious mind\nEighteenth number one single this week in Nineteen eighty five the recording industry association of America the R.

veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for surveyed my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just that these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nAll a lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was um\nA friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the fields of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know a historian\nA but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ... who's the chief scientist at\nIons good guy he uh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J be Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcaster who's out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that uh it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building that night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are than calling me and and saying hey I got that might want to share with you so I think it's I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people\nA express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce old sol high in his latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues\nAnd cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in awhile put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which to do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you yeah that\nI was very I I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep\nI thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like it it it was an angelic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right she um\n[noise] there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nOr there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a a\nTo bridge spans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the\n... ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped\nAnd once again I felt this this light in this worm and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion

your calls as well as we talk about time list the paranormal world just so many different kinds of pure and almost stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver\n[laughter] well I grew up in a in a um [noise]\nIn our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly where my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it\nAll of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was hoping to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked\nAround and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but it and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and\nUm it it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nUh I I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is offered it\nAt the college and I am a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get but ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical do ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or\nSeven weeks in the course into the course um and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience and really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun\nA that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had\nTwo full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are reasons what they would call a residual hunting I suppose they that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I\nYou know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression it and my explanation for what's going on with that\nNow it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to you\n[noise] I was the uh the unfortunate victim

got up and there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I had to go get something you know some water or something and then all of a sudden I I went
