A. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether those global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first of all\nSure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a\nPhrase use over and over his think outside the box so the title was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nA and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent\nOf renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of uh their wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess and now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S\nAre lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a\nA rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much uh\nCleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers as me come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations to become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn it a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and do you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are\nAre they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand year cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real it's like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment

signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders of a a signed up to this uh\nMost of them signed the Kyoto Protocol and Nineteen Ninety seven and um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago today and they mentioned that all the nations have signed up to the Paris accords even even though President Trump has said he's going to withdraw\nIt is kind of a universal\nThing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their to their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you and you are or have to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual\nClimate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was\nAhead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment or they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWasn't there a scandal among some of the scientists who were ... you know pro man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the ease the climate gate was called the University of East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOh they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either an insight or or a hacker and these emails showed some very bad behavior uh there were a uh guys that are\nOr were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act or there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk hating a data are there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process\nI'm just I'm just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that that the scientist so these things and by the way this was a this was the primary mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track of they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were

of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their young to call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that\nUm manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks in it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there\nTo to affect the current so um there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nWasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this external thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the ball Keno these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make you\nStill doing its thing whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind bills ... when I when I was living in Oregon okay\nAnd I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty more boy blue flame\nYou know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas or where he now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity\nNow come back and they said no no no ... going to cost too much I can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Want to go why has there been anything done about that\nWell I think they are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment is three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills or but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext on let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor\nBumped into spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air in inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct yeah I think it's\nAbout it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours\nThe day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or\nA ... a a young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the process is told us is this is just set in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive really improve their lives they're doing All right with out is just lost the will rich a lot of them are are turning illegally into this country because they had been tricked and deceived into thinking\nThey're going to get a better quality of life and they had down there\nBecause there had been a lot more money in their pocket but yeah I didn't I didn't want to\nDriving too fast for conditions I copy on a plane makeup lunch on really shop and what's going to be a urges huge to drive safely and in the day takes a wrong turn ...

United states Western Europe Russia China we have for us growth are stable for us so there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise to hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a if you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey a if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um\nUh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... that used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve odd routes you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb and what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky if they know out there's\nA lot of sand but harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to the south\nYou how to do it first of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon\nBut there's a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure is on coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters\nAnyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAct of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's happened in our with our weather\n... ones don't hear about it and the new let's can Steve's reaction to that Bruce IQ\nBruce said some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempt spoke to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nWell Mr go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay or engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the boycotting out son where people are so much heck shooting word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want or against that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the show on the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with a man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant they want they were doing a stripping the oil um industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China that's over there with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it going to play the oh I Know now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nWell somebody had to wear out of time

to coast here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nAnd on this particular day he was standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think keep to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it all in other words there were like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd want to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers gone again well moments later he sees them less willing in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so we had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness\nAreas or for instance when we talk about man this is a very interesting a story\nA\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the rest of New England combined and you're\nPercent of it is uninhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in may and we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people who had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out\nI mean they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tool the wife is singing the husband was to shovel with ... with the so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory and then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSo having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools\nAnd they started they left to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife called the stroke table on the patio and they were using them ... plants\nAnd\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNobody could understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife scope doubt nine feet off the ground one of these you know what one piece\nHand garden trials with a rubber handle on it shoved into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone ... took pictures of it they brought a latter route the husband couldn't Bush drifting was buried in the tree several inches couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shovel and the ... everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\nWell\nI said the long and short of it was a couple of days later\nThey came outside and the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taken the head of lettuce one mash\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was the gate on the garden and it just step right over the warrior winning\nAt it's full of feed and then left\nRecall the uh the police over to see what had happened that would have transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big tall creatures coming in their property a walking here now so it it\nJust seemed convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs a very odd thing you know you don't you think about the UFO\nWell nice to talk

... from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time to call and they formed this unlikely friendship\nAnd turn that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with so\nWhen you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the bearing you see\nAnd it did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a\nPulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other\nSo it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yeah any any abominable below snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable bowl a snowman come to life and\nUh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of\nPeople around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax the film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can't get in Oklahoma City she's nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires\nUsing a green a\nGreen vows and that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area right night for the hike well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision\nOr by knock you lose your own monarch yellow or that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance\nOf light moving around in the woods now of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern\nBut then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that their parents and the it was bright\nYeah I mean it it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow a bubble through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this orbit and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but there were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white light with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately\nIt was then that they said the Louis ... white light that were surrounding the big foot starts to dissipate where now the creature was left standing in the light of the circular all up and then they said it's\nColumbia help on the dot com present the world's worst books but one of those jobs don't
