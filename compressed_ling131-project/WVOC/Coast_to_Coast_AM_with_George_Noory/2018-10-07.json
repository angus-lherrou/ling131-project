name recognition\nOver I'm\nJohn James and over over bill shooting it doesn't make sense you're actually going to be voting for somebody who would go against the Trump academy who would go against the good things that Trump has done for industry bringing jobs back we think about that if you really want that it would go backward you'd be voting against\nWhat you voted for him twenty six teams there's no good reason why\nAnd by the way those have you voted for Trump to twenty sixteen he's done everything he promised he would do I can't imagine one good reason why you would make a vote on the state level or a local level that would go against that very it's very interesting to watch the process we got a line for it's gonna be Bruce in North Carolina Hi Bruce\n[noise] hey what's your face in the bowling let's go [laughter] come on brother what's happening yeah hold on okay sure\nYeah hey I just want to say that um I think what the Democrats are doing is fantastic they should or could have doubled down and get more ridiculous than just fake everybody elected under the Clinton\nWhite agree with you I think that it's either going to make love to sit at home or some people who are moderately left might actually vote right because that how dumb this whole thing was\nThat this just craziness and they they need to just doubled down and do it again and and I and our next target and you know people\nDie brother I Gotcha appreciated but what if what if very odd vote situation that was a I Know he put me on the speaker and walked away when he got there is allowed resolved but Bruce I think it's a it's a point well taken as somebody who is a conservative in this country and I am I'm unabashedly conservative um I like to see when the left him floats\nAnd that's what they just did those or just regular Americans who happen to be Democrats are orally liberal and by the way I have no need for you I understand there's a different position different outlook I get it but as

P.\nTo assist civilian intelligence police FBI and so forth\nIn locating missing children and founded PSI to develop solutions for intelligence related data analysis prior to the facts about projects Stargate being declassified he trained only those people who were in a position to know about that technology\nAre jealous of mcgonigle was uh born January tense Nineteen forty six in Miami, Florida he voluntarily joined the U.S army and was recruited by the army of Security Agency for classified assignments\nOr he do eventually eventually it into a project\nStargate while there he earned a legion of merit for providing critical intelligence reported that the highest echelons of our military and government\nIncluding such national level agencies as the joint chiefs of staff DIA NSA CIA and the secret service producing crucial and vital intelligence unavailable from any other source\nWhen he retired in Nineteen eighty four he maintained his association with Stargate or in general the program through his own company in to the intelligence applications\nAnd now Paul Smith\nPaul served in the Fort Mead a remote viewing program Stargate September of eighty three to August of Nineteen Ninety and was trained in C.

[laughter]\nI guess you could senses of the word\nHuh All right uh in order that you know this is not TV so in order that we might sell you apart if wasn't responding to something you would say this is Leon or Joe or Paul you'd would be awfully helpful I think for the audience um\nSo what I'd like to let you guys do is sort of banter back and forth and what we must begin with his explaining to the audience um what remote viewing is who's good at doing that\nOh this is Joe ... okay well I'd like to answer that if I could\nI'm In my opinion what remote what differentiates remote viewing for normal psyche functioning is the remote viewing is usually done within a control protocol\nAnd that ... protocol is essentially been the same and has been on trains then so be original a research into remote viewing and Nineteen Seventy two Sri\nUh one of the things that dictates remote that dictates the protocol is that remote viewing is uh usually done blind with the subject and uh that there are specific requirements that go along with the protocol that are generally not violated\nA generally not violated all three of you have gone from the military Stargate Program into individual endeavors in civilian life ... any of the three of you in any way significant or not modified the protocols are in your civilian endeavors\nUh this is land let me answer that um\nWhen I was in the service or working there as database manager um the NGOs one technique is a largely intuitive\nAnd uh and then several spots it's not at all logical and as a result of seeing a\nMany many times when people will improve on it and watching the database each time I've seen the results go down um I have a\nAs strictly as possible to the uh NGOs one technology now I've added a few things that take the information and uh and expound on it but as far as the\nExcuse me as far as the basic uh oh technology itself I wouldn't change it for the world [noise] uh this is Paul I'm\nIt might be useful to to clarify something here um we're actually dealing with a couple of different approaches to remote viewing or Joe uses a one approach a linen I use another\nWe learned ours are essentially for single swan uh it's called controlled remote viewing I used to be called coordinate remote viewing\nJoe uses another a technique which I I don't know what he calls that we tend to call it back in the unit the E R B or extended remote viewing or the goal of both approaches is to essentially control the process\nAnd in fact I I call it a ... century remote viewing yeah in a very kind of flip what you're saying is is discipline ... in a way that you have set our protocols as as a Joe's expressed which help\nFlesh wall write a letter than what was history of you say with regard to percentage of a obviously a lot of people I suppose could approach fifty fifty on certain things are how far above that does remote viewing go\nUh actually let me jump in here and say oh this is Len uh say that the fifty fifty thing is right or wrong if you have to select until the color of a card for instance you can say red or black you have a fifty fifty chance what you have to\nPredict the color of a traffic light than you have a thirty three percent chance right if you have to predict the condition of a certain spot in the desert ... percent do you have chance um\nThe a good point and and also when you when people ask for accuracy they have noted many times that are\nDifferent people have reported different amounts of accuracy for a remote view it quote remote viewing which is a general term actually oh\nWell if you compare your accuracy or if let us say we take a white or black piece of something and put it in an envelope right and compare your accuracy doing remote viewing compared to uh the average Joe's guess how do you\nI I'm Glad you asked it that way because\nI've been doing a new extended experiment on this here lately with the written book cards and right now I'm at sixty eight point three percent\nAs compared to the average Joe's fifty percent\nFifty percent All right gentlemen old time we're at the bottom of the hour\nThree former Stargate Project Stargate remote viewers in Buchanan

Monica will ah who even one time scored one hundred percent on a on fifty two cards\nWow that was very very impressed I should someday reached that did did you say one hundred percent or there was one instance in the database where he got one hundred percent correct so it can be done one one\nThat this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about the accuracy of [noise] I I've been working for over Thirteen Years with the cognitive science lab in California that that's the original founders of the original research and remote doing and uh we we've collected statistics on on dozens of remote yours or what I Would call world classroom outdoors\nAre generally speaking a on an average a very good remote viewer can be expected to make contact with the target site about sixty sixty five percent of the time\nAnd out of the information they provide\nA the the hackers through the information will run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent\nNo there there are times when the good remote viewer will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare and when someone establishes they're they're sort of history over a long period of time say tend to ah Nineteen years\nAh that that's the kind that percentage as you can expect\nOne of those percentages increased with a team\nNo I'm from a research standpoint uh everything that we have in the database that we've looked at it are the kind of the science lab\nUh [noise] there's the media has a you know blatantly shown since the November a Ninety five a exposure the project [noise]\nAh the giggle factor goes up when someone starts talking about inside gigs sure nobody either has a political career wants to be caught dead standing next to any of those like it's\nAll in fact we had tremendous support from the Senate on down\nIn a in some very important positions in government and when those people were asked to respond in particular to the Nightline program or without exception all of them responded positively but refused to go on the air or state that publicly [noise]\nAll right I'm not surprised um you all three of you have now turned to sue the civilian application for a remote viewing um\nAre there are there other ethical and moral limits or if I Walk into one of your organization's with a whole ... bundle of money and I say look I Want to know what it means to be she is going to produce into following area what they're doing Lou you do that for me\nUh this is Lynn I um have very definite moral and ethical limitations there are certain things I Will not teach a and basically during the span of the course just a learning the basics\nThere is so much to learn that oh you don't really have time to learn all of those esoteric things anyway are\nNow asking me what in wait wait oh there are certain things you won't teach\nOh I Do not oh even address the subject of remote influencing and won't um\nOh all three of you I take it agree remote influencing which means uh by the way folks the ability at a distance or to influence what somebody else actually does not just read their mind but influenced their mind not only that it is possible\nOr remember it's not remote control it's remote influence understand right oh the um go ahead Lynn or I Want to ah make one thing very clear by the way of keeping the database I kept all of the information on all the projects\nAnd at no time\nWas there ever an official\nTasking\nTo our unit are done by our unit\nOr involving remote influencing anything that was done was done by individuals on their own time and there was some experimentation and so forth but at no time where we ever task\nTo do that well would it be your view when a unofficially that remote influencing is possible\nI Believe so I uh have collected the data and tried the experiments and have come to the conclusion that it's extremely possible\nMy God then you know I I again this brings me back to the military as a parent dismissal of this remote influencing would be of such intense interest to them or that it just seems impossible to me that they would not fully explore it\nWell if you're a politician funding something would you want to get caught funding remote influencing on me\nOr I don't think any politician does and of course anytime you do something and government there's always the chance of a leak and somebody finding out\nThen again they let it go death sure but they don't want to get caught selling missiles to Iran either\nWell that's right and our government does lots of things that it it might not otherwise want to get caught at and the idea of being able to remotely in ... influence of Boris Yeltsin or or Saddam Hussein or any of the other big guys\nThis is Joe I'd like to comment on that from a science standpoint sure um I ... as I said before I've been over Thirteen Years with their cognitive science as well but uh there there are a number of labs across America um that had been involved in a remote doing research and\nMany of those labs have tried some some experimentation in the remote influencing arena\nThere has been some some very interesting and provocative results which are still very much up in the air\nUh so if you were to say absolutely we can prove remote influencing you would have to say no we can't but if you said that there probably that there is a high probability that it's possible\nYou would have to say yes but all the research isn't in yet that based on that uh I don't know how you would actually apply it and uh be expecting a very uh open ability to validate the outcome\nThat's right um and the experimentation I've done a the experimentation I Know is completely full of holes and could be shut down by a you know junior ... scientist\nNo but uh I have a done the experiment to my satisfaction\nAre now believed\nThat it can be done and quite easily oh but as far as proof I'm Still waiting for prove myself\n[noise] um our president has done from time to time over the last several years things did seem utterly uncharacteristic how many of you had anything to do with it\n[laughter] but I voted in with my vote\nNo [laughter] All right I'm without naming anybody would want to view say Oh yes I definitely and my own mind I Believe that I definitely remotely influenced somebody's action\n[noise] yes uh this is what I was saying I Am convinced by so that it does work\nUh-huh um\nAgain repeat that it\nWas never official never efficient and more of\nThis is Joe or one of the problems here are is um when you start talking about remote influencing of other individuals and then you bring in uh integrity and uh\nYeah and that sort of thing as a ... ethics ... one of the problems\nThat you become very heavily embroiled in especially within America and especially within research um is the fact that there are human use considerations that be taken into consideration and\nAs soon as as soon as you are sort of formally identified someone to participate in such an experiment you have to tell them front what's going on All right\nGentlemen hold tight uh we'll be right back is premier network that was art bell

each other\n[laughter] well uh let me let me address that ah I've been watching this on the net\nWait a minute who is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I'll have been watching\nThis on the net and ah if you look very closely or the the\nConcept or the feeling that over ... years or squared off at each other is a form of sort of disinformation in itself okay the\nAh people who are squared off at each other's seemed to be a ed squared off that Dave Dave squared off it it ah it and I are at and Joe ... and\nUh I think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern growing there oh\nWhy do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it there are several reasons\nOne I'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service he started a\nHe started giving classified information to the public oh I'm a while it was still classified uh he uh is making claims that he oh ran the project\nThat he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable things of\nIt not happen you say not true or not true All right uh oh I'd like\nTo make a comment here as well uh this is Joe ... is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh and that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right oh here's the facts are we going to go as has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this ... let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay well that's actually not completely correct to end his nose pulled the Jews because they didn't overlap had came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nUm it actually did indeed do did participate in some operational what we're doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst task or a management training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard he wasn't hired primarily as remote you are in only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one ... uh no you argue that crisis on for on for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list is if you are on I really I\nDidn't have that and I didn't remember that from my data base uh this is Joe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right um the claim was made a um buy at a\nDams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer\nTeacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was a responsible viewer and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to to act as a monitor and interface with the the viewer in terms of a fan linger setting up remote doings in that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained\nIn the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing and and that's OK that\nHad specific jobs within the unit 'em and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform\nYou know righteously into the job or very well [laughter] ah or I have a problem is where he makes claims then then attributes them to themself when they're in fact I don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more today\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom [noise]\nUh this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been\nPredicting doom death and destruction for years and years and years now\nUh-huh uh would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nThat would be with her or something and this is a a\nN and that's fine I'm ... one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make up production or you make a statement about something\nA one would hope that there would be some politically or some method by which you could prove whether you're the brass city the information or I could certainly choose or pick targets that are completely and verifiable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that danger\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so called [laughter] um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd deems has said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell add to come up with these numbers\nI said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that oh so how about coming on the program and setting up a structured test uh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program\nI'm do any of you feel that\nThe amazing Randy's challenge could be a\nTaken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind\nUh and if you if anyone does things on his terms or he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate uh\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh you'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a\nYou know that he uses for for his own a popularity and so forth\nOK buddy that yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThan he wouldn't participate in the eye\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about that he he doesn't except the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs in the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show art in in establishing a valid or reasonable protocol and allow

this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn a I had started a a a do war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I said look\nI I Believe are based on a remote during my experience is that uh the UFOs a real uh let me say that up front\nI have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with UFO phenomena of not seen direct proof of that however are within the context of aliens I Would have to say that are also very similar experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps call Ian\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um and it could be essentially time travelers a extra dimensional a projections\nWhich are almost anything and I don't think we possess pushing proved to say one way or the other what they might your answer Joe\nI'm very however all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us well\nThis is Joe Joe I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of\nAnd it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having in a while we may not be able to say ... very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at\nWhat happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly in we wind up with something very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course\nThey are I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nA generally so yes well that here's Paul I'm from the the biggest body of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might disclose the existence of some human source that we have you know and\nAnd a human outside I'm at risk or you know uh there's a lot of stuff in there that doesn't even involved with them doing that that is sensitive to end or important to ah American security would agree with that\nYou made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time oh well this is Lynn ...\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um I was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance\nTo meet a person named uh\nWho was going to put out a book\nOr this book was about the Stargate project and he asked me to take a a copy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript remember everything was still classified highly classified\nI'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nAre [noise] I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do though they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm\nUh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got it from it\nOh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any age you could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you bite the cyanide pill and die before you do that and yet here was the entire list uh\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a classified thing now the reason that upset me so much was because I'm up another incident where it at a meeting had gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and uh I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate the publishing the book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russia and\nOh or psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing\nThan a remote view in our data collection and ah ah so I could still find no other reason for giving that information to court and they then\nHave something happen to us and uh that upset me very much and uh uh I stayed around ... court and they not only took the first chapter out but also deleted it from his computer ah I wanted to make absolutely certain that was completely gone\nLook guys were at the top of the hour anybody here have to bail out or can you stick around a little bit\n[noise] so I can stay on for a while on all ...

would be out there oh one obvious target in this area uh would've been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm\nI I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time I of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd uh what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location\nThat was being targeted Roswell which was the believe crash site ah there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a a possible ... collusion between uh\nUh some birth birth bound traffic\nAnd probably involved some materials that were sent to\nEnhance or then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did indicate that there was probably a neat that but it was probably not a ... a alien associated\nDuring hot Joe I'm a vaccine for you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I felt was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or ghosts for spirits\nAnd the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters and near where I was discussing a my interaction with what you might call entities that uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make it very clear\nA while these these may have been a personal experience that I think is bell ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a severe um of feeling um\nI I Believe it it's my personal belief a based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote doing that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature are essential existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in a spiritual and to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught them out to cutting off the left\nSo to speak right\nNow I hear well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing\nOf Christ um\nKent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes oh but it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I\nI Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or had the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do with a\nLittle right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or a in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but ah um you know I I just don't know where that's coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that uh uh would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this is land could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive the very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that comes to a person\nI think is basically caused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring a danger that is then let loose um\nI have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a a remote view in session where this session itself or the target itself\nA had a had a danger to the fewer oh\nI think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that dangers been there all along anyway\nI'd ... I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote doing but I Would like to uh underscores the fact that uh this is a very interesting um\nExperience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that are that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct\nOr it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with reality in other words they become a pretty much in in a involved there are caught up in the the irrationality of it or the\nCan get a this is Joe let me uh I had responded to that earlier and ah there's an additional comment I could make in that regard\nA wall there's evidence that there probably is a capacity for some form of remote influencing\nThe the problem has been that uh because of ethical in human years reasons uh whenever those experiments are done you have to inform the person the targeted individual that they're participating in a remote influencing experiment\nAnd as long as those particular rules or an existence would be tantamount to impossible to know whether or not remote\nInfluencing is actually taking place as a result of\nA unknown targeting or whether or not by virtue factor person knows they're involved in that kind of experiment there actually willing willingly opening themselves to being targeted\nSo it it's an issue that probably won't be answered and kill someone has come about a with an approved protocol that in target individuals without them knowing or on wedding targeting\nWell there's a lot of uh talk going on now about influencing of a different sort of by the Chinese with regard to our present administration and one would have to imagine if there is a Chinese project Andrews remote influencing is possible that would have been an obvious or\nA major a project or would you all agree\nA little ahead oh I I I Would agree except that I haven't seen any evidence that the Chinese are in fact going up so it's sort of a moot question and I'm not sure how anyone would would evaluate results with uh\n[noise] you know there have been there's a there have been a lot of reports about the Soviets having been involved in that in the past um but it's mostly kind of rumors and and and such a again no evidence of course I was thinking of this nature it'd be hard to prove any way\nBut there was some interest in what wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nAll that there are All right gentlemen hold tight we'll be right back to you\nA gathering of eagles I'm calling in Linda Buchanan Joe ... and Paul Smith all involved in projects\nDarn good for the U.S government which ran for Twenty years using your tax dollars\nAnd listening to our bill somewhere inside there might be drink coast to coast am ...

know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original abacus awry\nAnd then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a uh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research are appealing and we hope to continue a pursuing the mechanism behind remote doing\nCan you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work ah ah you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nOr we we're of course it see a sellout are the kinds of Sciences lab has never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function [noise] we've recently\nWe've done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and you know those Preval which we have every reason to believe they will or will be some very astounding a findings that will open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every time I chose scares me enough uh I I Am\n[noise] uh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it that I Would agree with that or\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was

will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't do it however if you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it that I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate [noise]\nUm I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience that is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nMost I call 'em\nSound like somebody else wants his face when they do but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the and I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and export and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's that's right Joes joke I I just want to add one thing for you Dr um I Would encourage people to retain or skepticism\nAnd to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain or open a to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge is developed and\nIt's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions\nWell you know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want to instill a demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is not is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national a national television and\nAnyone in America and uh

uh-huh um what are your thoughts on his conclusion [laughter]\n... inclusion or the end conclusion was that a yes this shows that are there is something to remote viewing a seemingly however oh\nWe don't have all of the potential is for a for shooting it down and so uh even though we can't shoot it down right now we're just going to wait until the time comes when we can shoot it down before we make a decision\nAnd uh this to me is not a a is not a valid\nA\nConclusion the ah\nThe conclusion he came to is basically the [noise] excuse me that he admitted that the statistics show that there is value to the remote viewing that there is an actual phenomenon going on but [noise] oh\nInteresting reaction yeah but let's not decide right now until we can find a way to shoot it down\n[laughter]

is that it's not too sensitive at all\nUm I I think what the question is is could give an example All right Ken you uh yes um\nI have no feedback on this one ah because you know I was I was the viewer and this is one we wouldn't get feedback on I did one session where a ride in the middle of the session what's called a phase the stage seven\nUh came in and uh basically my subconscious turned an

one uh please ask when if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed first [noise]\nOh not personally oh that is a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um\nYou know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically getting that I have always felt that are a form of man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological bondage\nAnd then he you know good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and I'm a before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re\nMost humorous [laughter] yeah [laughter] how but you answer the way you want Lynn\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm\nI'm well a A R B a alternate remote viewing\nUh which uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers and ah allows you to a remote view for instance the picked three now the way that's normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who collect\nThe data looks on the chart to see what\nThe results Maine and goes and places Tibet off um but it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell if remote influencing as possible how about sending ed McMahon and the gang up my driveway\nWell do you help people like this are Lynn\nA yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and for many other reasons as well\nOr if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen I Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them partially because I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity\nThat oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nOr die ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case you can't have your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no and I think for many years ...\nYears but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years\nAnd uh and on the results of our ah our session a mill Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding are I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lane okay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nUh do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on the pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time\nWe are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on the east so uh oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day ah we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lyndon Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning my credit for you and I tried to follow up care to cover up a fifth grade or is that\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much a does a session on a target and they're wrong out of your respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to\nTwo different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to end deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nLot of mistakes there'll be paid and\nAnd there'll be a sort of virtual anarchy that would develop that's\nMy fear I Do believe very strongly in the show Drake effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly the more we learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encouraged\nMe incorrectly ... and a dishes my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh\nI'm afraid that they're going to through the ... just a you know the hundred McKee if that's your uh just uh almost destroyed any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released did a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sun has to be up back there huh\nYes uh looking at the one who it is a huh\nAll right my friend while I I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer and uh this will keep you busy for a while it has been a

Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nOh and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that actually\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that I still doing that I remember you know there's always go X ray your candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and I know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off an X ray at the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out [laughter] you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so that he can steal stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the hunted since come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials be have you know when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the hair you\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nUh the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's B it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nHum and this is when you started getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you\nSee since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future\nOn Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ah on us no good question you know I think that um you know ... ... ... Halloween as mentioned I mean it's\nIt's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each ... each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary\nScary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there is asserting innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any of any faith in Korea\nI'm now who doesn't like to dress up like a dress up right I mean you're okay eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's something that is I think is\nInherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and national for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ... or in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know [noise] uh\nYou know where you got like holy crap [laughter] do you get to that yeah that was the thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their say panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm ... and this is will will tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guess sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\nColumbia help on the dot com present so world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't huge there's no jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date [noise]\nHi Dave let's talk about that job you posted for a senior manager okay I've got a lot of applicants already tape you posted on that huge national jobs like what a waste one guy says he's been everything from top Walker to stay at home uncle you here staying home uncle and dog Walker and here's super fun guy who loves animals\nPosting on that huge national jobs I just wasted our time scrolling through irrelevant applicant book I said we're looking for people who are willing to take chances and have a great sense of humor and here's a guy who's a sky diving\nClown backgrounds qualified to me we need serious applications from local candidate resume that you've found me on a huge national jobs I please don't remind me Dave\nDon't be a day but find your perfect local employee at Columbia help wanted dotcom local jobs that were\nNot discriminate against people named Dave Dave the common name funded than so we're using it as a catchall for lackluster buses everywhere they post jobs in the big national board because they really don't care if he's not right is to tell us your dates with insulted by this that that would be a real date moved Dave\n...

will appear on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes tiny stuff so\nLet's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it it works with the\nWill of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nUm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know\nAnd the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean it's one of those things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reached out and grab the crow somebody or whatever and it's the only thing that some of that but\nBut you know that's you for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who are just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause damage because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the fans here what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the role of you\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to Eighteen\nYou know shock not suffer which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of a more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and\nOn the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it is it a wage board are strictly prohibited anyone using ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so so concerned that using a word you board was going to open up you know be more on that corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules are going to sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat's when because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was that\nA kid the dresses up as a witch or a goal will become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from Holly this is not always as a harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um\nYou know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights in the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from\nFrom back then it was a wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to ... just the way it was right down the marathon\nBar on either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop to because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I I mean anything Googled afterward on here that\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their

F. um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person here\nWho tried to do some stuff with something called the God helmet\nA and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think it was awesome\nAnd if they're real and I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it well\nYou know um I I don't know it go for I mean that that you know a quarter million dollar question right I mean you even even among the the ghost hunter unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you don't have a theory that there is something that's going on and\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and treat the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the day that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions you know problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both in our dimensional spirits and you know a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know there's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I I don't know what goes\nObviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spiritual the debt that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving me the information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to you but are coming up so we're going to be talking they wear Wilson London so you'll want to stick around Benjamin 'cause all Sinclair he somebody you want to me out in the case in time definitely thank you yeah yeah well tell us where we can find you and I get more information\n[noise] yeah ah you can find me I'm On Facebook or ...

H O the blessing to the phony what are you off at first\nI couldn't believe what I was looking at so what what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small bone it or you know your horse\nIt's an interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait expert to host to London move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet sudden\nSomething not to me I look at that\nIs it and it was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen is that he led them before they run away he said what he was on all fours and he said if it to the store to open to that being over seven foot and looked like a body builder he said he had no\nHe said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of about ... about whom and ... and ... and he said he's able to almost sort of Britain billing cooler you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both\nAreas and\nThat what he's citing he says well he said I went to him to the edge to them to try and get stiff it's just to protect myself it says although there's nothing we could have done it this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said both the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know\n... miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast corny but if you if you go further down the coast towards home or in the papers probably two years ago there was a piece of bumps and drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd it was such a supposed to be aware of that was sort of going the bombs to drain rooms into the sea six miles from what I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported but moving along the coast and they could go further up the coast you go [noise]\nOld folklore and old legend old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scottish what would they to the pet food and you know these stories after they've come down to being hunted down in time but the the\n...
