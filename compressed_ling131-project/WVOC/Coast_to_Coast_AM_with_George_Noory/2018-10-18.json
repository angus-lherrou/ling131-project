once said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nAll the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out\nA and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this is a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there\nAre also fared ... practice laws federal um a fruit than lending laws\nUh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans who came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp\nThe beltway cabal of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] ah and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits\nYes served on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and\nShe can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise] uh and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan whatever\nHappened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the\nPrice to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you ... ... per year that's tuition room board books um\nFor for your course for a four year college and\nBy the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much data on the ... the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt I there was a story just recently\nWe're losing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\n[laughter] that's right you know and and just really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how this student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes

that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three ... and um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to be a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is it Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear mark for people who need some money and the you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and\nYou know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's had a great reviews you go in and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership here at like hey guys you know the car as no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no break you know\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly as you as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to\nUm you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical educations that joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest it's about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is the very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned\nFor Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from\nPeople go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand dollars apiece crazy so this has just gotten\nUnreal um this is not this is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you George got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah\nThere was a big signs they throw support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of trades will do a ... a former cub there used to work or I got trained on egg wildly\nWhen a totally went under the under the company and I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd that was one of those people too so I ended up her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me thanks as well as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local schools they were to import thousand dollars just to go for oh I I think it was up to the horse there's no one said well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive in I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on hug 'em it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is the ...

on my bachelors ...\nWell what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger alone and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your

more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a loan and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listing a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he tried to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close you know like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are some be loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nWhen he released a on the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like

loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nPromise [laughter] not at all at once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon homeboy

certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to\nTo try in one document tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government thorny relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't tie is the kind of suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know all the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you know like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid told the long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story\nIn one sense for years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing man if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a\nThan a third one but now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this rock stone guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rule\nWell I took a long on on on that one and it was quite a diverge and for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this and when you see the\nFinal product sometimes you think well well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that back then and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so scripted the entire movie that the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way\nI have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom a a day it's a completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like Jeremy ... just made a a a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish within the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nI as I say really to try to talk through some of the the\nConfusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I I think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't get too many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand we'd go ahead on to all the platforms\nThat the young people do you watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food to and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did tenants to uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it by where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization Dewey ... nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is\nWhat do you think that when when you say the organization um he\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nI ... I mean clearly ironic in another way that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought this would dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm skepticism is in the coal ah intellectual\nA human character system but I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it's a ... probably trying to be true skepticism itself I mean it ... to have effectively the so called us skeptics in the end\nUm say they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things for the call it's just in one sense it's paying one on your plea fringe belief for another really these are these people were skeptics are told they would believe that they would you\nBelieve in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on the coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other ... would you do in the ... stadium Facebook page just go to Facebook dot com slash goes to goes to him and the like button [noise]\n\nIs that he was ... the system and receiving cushy treatment he was transferred to the maximum security lockup Alcatraz Island in California San Francisco bay he got out early in Nineteen thirty nine for good behavior\nPlayed by health problems for the rest of his wife component died in Nineteen forty seven and eight forty eight at his home in palm island Florida\nThis week in Nineteen sixty eight Chevrolet began to sell a car truck hybrid instead of calls the el camino inspired by the food ranchero which had already been on the market for two years the Nineteen sixties and seventies this weekend Nineteen eighty seven and an event that had viewers around the world glued to their televisions\nEighteen month old Jessica ... she became known baby Jessica is rescued after being trapped for fifty eight hours in an abandoned water wells in Midland, Texas and this week in two thousand seven comedian and actor drew Carey takes over hosting duty\nOn the prices right the longest wanting daytime game show in television history carry replace Bob Barker retired at age eighty three after hosting the show for thirty five years that's your ... as we can history\nBut I never heard them ringing\nNo one ever heard so much to\nDo was to\nAh well in God but I never ...\nNo one ever saw was oh\nIt was\nWas the one of\nRooms they show the sweet fragrance\nMeadows ...\nDo though was no longer\nBut I never heard singing\nYou know on a little to\nDo was to\nLive from the gateway to the west coast to coast am George Norris we'll be back with more with the pope and we'll take calls next door with the pope as we talk about his work ... at the Pentagon fascinating DVD fascinating indeed\nCriminal multi dot com approaching eighty thousand members now why such just truly remarkable so if you haven't signed up for you and it's free to sign up just go to the website colonel dates dot com and meet people who get your paranormal the dot com or something that will help make you look\nA little more healthier\nScience has come a long way in helping us look younger now we have an amazing product to give you near instant result with bags into your eyes fine line wrinkle roast beef and pork it's called instantly aids loss and\nWent the two minutes see dramatic changes to your look no needle no pain instantly age ... is a cream applied lightly and allowed to dry look younger and intern feel younger\nAnd do within minutes even doctors agree instantly aid work like this from the Rachel ratio\nBoard certified dermatology factor wouldn't need file farewell can turn back the clock on a bike and ride around home the planet the recurrent acknowledging emerging almost like showing the head of hair Erica my wallet that's how they can learn while we're going to try a product or aunt that lives on right on track you know go back\nHeard it on silicon really found a liar and we're going to split the money I make a difference\nAnd then she went off to try products\nCalled instantly age ... yeah instantly you can see a difference even the cameramen were like wow look at the different yeah I definitely use this\nProduct [noise]\nFine and it was actually a very traumatic were chicken ...\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.
