for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone in his subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in addictive phone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the pool you know in the pool but he's certainly dictated most description\nAnd honestly I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about

Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role well he he created the serious um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even pitched it he he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\nShort story sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nUm some but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with television I he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a rebuke to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who are the director and writer of get out\nA is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek but the new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be re injure reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\n\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know it's hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed\nOut and wants to go back to his home town and you know relive as youth and go back to a easier less stressful life was that it will be the uh it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be as kind of a companion piece to its well distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among my favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know the that's the [laughter] ever [laughter]\nAnd then just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a ever at Sloan who actually started rod Serling is very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater or he started that and you start in the fever and yet exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is\nTaunting him and it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or just talk with

the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms reading obviously we talked about some of the censorship but not on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are\nAre so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think he would be thrilled with how\nHow uh the with the quality of those shows of course we have many more channels now and he there's certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality television a cap on the um he and and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time I you know I guess reality television for its time\nA rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show it in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it's kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the the show or you know I thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so the reality of it and he would hate but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWilling old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows where you gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm ... older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that\nKind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously so much more competition that uh you know there'll be there'll be good it's kind of like talking about not major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more [noise] more competition\nWith rod say about all the different channels available though in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know I'd been his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nJust amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the sets which to me it was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering from Nick if he knew how many cameras used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that it that's one of the striking things about the series is is that you know of course the production level of in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the uh for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and the so and he did he got the most out of\nOut of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make you know there is one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like ... of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did he not\nYeah I think so\nIt's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon to\nBe Robert Redford yeah yeah has learned read\nFor actually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah it was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house\nIn a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom [laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know a says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was uh the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there's a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode and the\nOne that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode or certainly wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically well done episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally or at least ... years later and it was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas do you\nRobert ... absolutely right another great and you know great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half hour I'll rarely yeah okay\nYeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nUh and so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seems like it was very a scape is more than maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost\nLittle cemetery called uh enter lake and right on the lake and much loved that area and it's white or when they first got married they\nHad their honeymoon there\nAh on ah the lake or a ...\nA her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer if you are\nRight and relax and uh but uh a funny thing you do a little radio a promotion for ah people hey no an area like extreme or whatever might be a store I mean it's kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and everybody already which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of ... he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people have to college or or local businesses that I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent ... every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally or you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody saying a bad word about Russia oh\nYou really can't Nick we're going to take a

asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the end like where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card suppose that was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAlright you're running around out there in the city angels and you come across an old old house right hundred years old it's big coup all out there and there's a farmer and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of that stuff so right away you got a feeling that\nThis stuff might be a legit not that tag sale where some facts you guys can outsmart right right you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years yes see of fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask him a few\nQuestions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for the bite you buy it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nKnow well that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars no yeah oh\nI had a health care mind's eye and mental than Willie Mays him\nAll to myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to do with kids we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards from\nIran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles or what would those cards you've been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value of very much probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do a little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right everybody's on the baseball cards saying nobody's buying football cards which means you should be playing football\n... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called the big plate\nHe had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie guards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball card but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like a ... by his rookie cup the bike discard\nRight some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth anything\n[laughter] I don't know I did have a amount of sweating occurred did you really do it like a million dollars isn't it\n[laughter]
