two weeks it's been number one in the country of the New York times with all that we don't know what it's gonna be this coming week\nYou never know but ah any weak at all is a good weekend appreciate that [laughter]\nUm you believe a summing up the the jury and the Simpson case wasn't smart the judge was bad right off the ... a prosecution was atrocious right and as far as the so called dream team is concerned quoting from your book\nI'll quote in fact it was only the greater incompetence of the prosecution's say ... bureau belly Scheck at all from defeat um yeah so [laughter] you really believe all that\nYeah not only not only do I believe it not only do I let it about anyone will read the book guys almost compelled to go along with those conclusions because if there's one thing about me are uh uh\nI never do I never make a charge without support in it and uh I have a tremendous amount of support for everything and I say I don't just say something without giving four or five examples to support what I'm saying\nWhen I talk about the incompetence of the prosecution in this case it's page after page after page there's just no way that anyone can read this book or without coming to the same conclusion and it's because\nOf these revelations the shocking revelations of incompetence in in my book out rate that the word of mouth has been such that the book has shot up the number one of the country because\nHere too for the American people have been blaming the jury for this verdict and of course the jury was very bad to don't get me wrong and I are on that at all very very bad\nThe many have been blaming the LAPD claiming the LAPD botched the case before I came to trial and but the main reason why this case was loss was the unbelievable incompetence of the prosecution in this case and you have to realize art I think you know my background I'm very\nPro prosecution no one in this country was more supportive of these prosecutors in Iowa throughout the entire case I mean I even sent them a telegram\nOn the morning or there's some Asian trying to pump them up but\nI'm an option here either not do the book and I actually I was shocked into doing it by my editor and I'm happy now that he did a or write the book and be candid and uh this is a very serious charge that I make and against the prosecution in this case I supported in space so there's just no question about it on either incompetent\nWas up there and watched every moment of the trial a lost a lot of sleep over and I presume you pretty much do as much as you could the same thing yeah did you sit there and sort of beating her fist against the wall about hey well\nYou know I also got on radio and TV I kept a to a minimum but I got on radio and TV and said many of the things that I'm saying in the book now so this is not Monday morning quarterback but I get on radio and television and say they've got to offer some of the evidence is very very incriminating evidence to like it was a conventional type of evidence that\nLaypeople you don't even have a very bright lay people have been consistently basing verdicts have guilty off for the past two centuries that's the type of evidence that\nIs automatically associated even by people rather low intelligence or with guilt DNA is very good evidence they'll get me wrong and I'm not criticizing the prosecution for presenting a DNA evidence in this case a but DNA is very complex very difficult to understand it it was almost alien to this jury\nBut evidence like Simpson\nOr taking off when he was being charged with these murders and they're finding in his possession a gun a passport a cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and and and ... the driver of the eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars in cash on him which he proceeds to tell the police the Simpson had given him inside the bronco that\nType is automatically associated by laypeople uh uh with guilt and it was not offered to this jury they never saw that evidence\n... speed stuff uh Dominic Dunn the respected writer has publicly stated one of the prosecutors didn't present that evidence he says through his sources\nThat he's aware of sheep conversations of Simpson during the bronco chase where he's talking on a cellular phone sobbing and crying claiming to be an innocent man who framed use that why they don't use it\nIn the frame no no absolutely not no no I'll Dominic is partly true there he was denying guilt a big deal\nBig deal up it means nothing when someone is charged with murder and they'd be an ideal of course they're going to do I get off who in the world expects them to confess\nThat is the reason by the way that the prosecution did not offer that evidence nor did they offer a suicide note with absolutely reek with guilt I mean showing an innocent person charged with murder who would write a note like that\nSo they were afraid of it well that yeah but but but for the wrong reasons in the suicide note\nSimpson denies guilt to also the thirty two interrogation of Simpson the day after the murders rent a incidentally I have the I was able to get a hold of the audio that thirty coming in interrogation and I've transcribe it and it's an independent of the book is the only book on the Simpson case that has interrogation ...\nWhere he admits dripping with blood on the night of these murders has no idea how he got caught but in that interrogation he also denies\nGuilt and the prosecutors you're right they kept that out they kept that out all of that because they didn't ... this is what they said and you can't make this up it's too far out to make up guard and says it in his book\nThey didn't want the jury to hear Simpson denying guilt without us taken the witness stand ... but aren't the jury already knew that Simpson had denied guilt I mean they knew he pled not guilty that's why they were having a trial for Pete's sake I mean\nIf the guy had come fast if he had pled guilty there would not have been a trial you're going to keep out extremely powerful evidence like this or just to prevent the jury from hearing something that they already know that is mind boggling and\nThis is the mentality of these prosecutors good people the good guys lost here this is the mentality of these people were representing the state of the Simpson case and and people wonder why this guys on the golf course with a smile on his face\nYou're going to keep out for instance the passport the cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and the fact that our colleagues has all this money on him which Simpson gave him all this cash because he's denying guilt because he's denying ... I mean the jury doesn't know that he's denying why are they having a trial it's mind boggling\nI don't know what about the civil trial and all of this that didn't come out in that trial will come out we were not in the civil trial I can\nGive you a virtual one hundred percent guarantee that um the plaintiffs lawyers like Daniel Patrick Charlie whom I spoke to do it they will be offering that evidence anyone would offer that evidence why these prosecutors didn't\nWhy they're so incompetent I don't know because I keep hearing that are on the federal why are they still incompetent why didn't they do this and I can't tell them I mean it's like asking me\nA wire Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dog a great basketball players I Can't tell you I can tell you that they are but uh the genesis of why they're so great uh I don't know but yeah\nThat evidence will be offered like virtually any other prosecutor in the country would have done if they had handled the case that evidence will be offered during the civil trial and I'm very confident that\nThere'll be a judgment against Simpson uh in that civil trial the question is whether he's already spirited as money out of the country and they're gonna be able to like on the judgment that none of the real problem\nDuring and Clark both how to marry in your face kind of a presentation and a lot of people translated that to competence and they apparently didn't look a little bit deeper at some of the things we just talked about oh with regard to the evidence not presented\nWell actually they were not in the face they should have been a lot more in the face they were much or too casual a and laid back they were extremely casual and laid back they may have been a little in the face a outside the presence of the jury when they were talking to judge Ito in front of a jury\nThey couldn't possibly have have been more dissident imagine in your eyes what this guy's Simpson did to these two victims viciously stabbing him to death you know their life blood draining out of them the horror and the pride in their eyes the last moments when they were trying to survive imagined that now imagine now imagine\nMarsha Clark during jury selection telling this jury\nWhile this thought as in your mind that I just told you he is such a sympathetic guy okay then telling the jury this is not a fun place for me to be making this up this stuff from the transcript\nIf she tells the jury this is not a fun place for me to be art that's like telling the jury you know I really don't want to be prosecuting this guy but I have been assigned the case so what can I Do then she tells the jury or you may not like me for bringing this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse\nThan to tell a jury that you're not winning any popularity caught as because if you're telling them that that's like telling them the majority of people outside that courtroom\nPosted on that huge national job site what a waste one guy says he's been everything from top Walker do stay at home on call\nYou hear see and home uncle and dog Walker and here's super fun guy who loves animals\nPosting on that huge national jobs I just wasted our time scrolling through irrelevant applicant look\nI said we're looking for people who are willing to take a great sense of humor and here's a guy who's this guy driving clown that sounds qualified to me we need serious applications from local candidate know resumes you've found me on\nThere's no jobs I please don't remind me Dave\nDon't find your perfect local employee at Columbia help wanted dot com local jobs but we're\nNot discriminate against people named Dave he was a common name from the sand so we're using it as a catch all for like Lester buses everywhere equals jobs and the big national ... because they really don't care if he's not right is to tell us your data was insulted by this that that would be a real ...\n\n\nWe've been on\nSomewhere in time I was raised new number one on the New York times bestseller list they all serve in the ...\nWe'll be right back [noise]\nMessaging to raise ... earning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

[noise]\n\n\nNow back to Vincent de ... uh Vincent welcome back\nHappy that God I just want to clarify what you're saying something about cutting himself in the fall and the media was saying that and they they made that assumption ah he did say something and the thirty ... an interrogation about going to the bronco\nTo pick up a cellular phone he did not say he cut himself and I thought I thought they asked them specifically how did you cut yourself his exact words the whole thirty two imminent interrogation as in the book he said I don't know later in the interview they asked him again how to get cut yourself and the exact words were I have no idea man so he is not the cut himself in his article\nDuring a vaccine do the prosecutors try the tactics that you fault them for because they were dealing with the jury system that's made up primarily of sympathizers to OJ and people who are not quote average citizens in ... in other words people who can take a you know several months off work to attend to trial\nWell I don't really know what that means because uh if these people weren't the brightest people in the world with which you question may imply that all the more reason why you offer conventional evidence like flight you know after he was being charged with these murders he took off the fact that he cut himself and has no idea how I got got cut the fact that he writes a suicide note I mean\nYou know when you're charged with murder or if you're innocent you're going to be blazing mad that you're being charged a desperately want to prove you're innocent find out who murdered the mother of two children instead he becomes very passive and he writes the farewell letter that ... like a suicide note uh your first comes off of the last person\nThese things are incompatible with innocent so in answer to your question at all the more reason why they should've offer these conventional uh items of evidence I'm not saying they should have offered DNA but not to the exclusion of these conventional\nLuke Luke ... talking about DNA per second all these other issues inside right I'm just an average person talk show host um but I understand numbers why didn't the DNA evidence alone convicted\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme uh uh uh incompetence here um the defense every time\nEvery time they made an argument to explain away incriminating evidence the prosecution either did not respond at all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion\nThe main pieces of evidence in this case other than that that tape but I just told you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pad I Would have convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation along but the main item of evidence against Simpson\nWas his blood was that the murder saying okay there was blood on the ... gate\nOr which was also has found later though\nYeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify not collected that night\nAnd that was not collecting is Dennis phone was the criminal that and he did not pick it up that night and things like that happened that doesn't confidence to you is picking up blood everywhere I mean it was awash in blood there and he did not pick up the evidence from there again it would seem that night there was even a photograph of two to three blood stains that night taken by the LAPD that night\nFind if you move from an out of the kids altogether is there a conviction\nOff [noise] if farm and we're not involved at all in this case um they would have had them the defense would have had a more difficult time\nArguing the conspiracy theory and injecting race into the case but they would have found some way to do it uh although it would have been more anemic the prosecution would have had a greater likelihood of a conviction or without a permit\nIs there any one thing you can think of it if you were to just pull it from the case would would have made it a slide the conviction\nSlide you say ... a law no no no because\nOf this jury um the private let me say this the prosecution when they presented scientific DNA evidence that Simpsons blood was founded the murder scene they did they did in fact\nSimpsons guilt beyond a reasonable doubt beyond all doubt but\nWhere we were dealing here with the jury that was not operating with too much intellectual firepower number one number too many of them particularly the black years were probably biased and Simpsons favor however here's the key point\nA powerfully presented tastes and summation which we didn't have here at all light years away from that where you put a bit on the jury and use spoon feed them can handle both of those problems but this was a problem jury no question about it and with a problem jury it's going to be difficult to get a conviction but you can do it you can do it\nWe're talking here about an F minus presentation and yet the first vote\nThis jury talk back in that jury room people\nTend to forget this a black journey white you're voted guilty on the first ballot doesn't emerging dollar an hour after the after the jury room if you can get a tend to with an F. minus presentation you can imagine bikes for Appalachian what would have happened\nOr if you'd had an a plus performance which the people the state of California are entitled to I think almost assuredly\nEven as the ... ah pardon even a C yeah\nYou'd have had a guilty verdict or at a minimum a hung jury that you'd have had problems with this jury unless you had an a plus performance the only type a jury\nThe only type a jury that you can't turn around art is the type a jury who state of mind is even though we know OJ's guilty or we don't care uh we like O. J. blacks have been discriminated against by white throughout the years we're going to give all day to free murders but let me tell you it would be extremely difficult\nTo find even one juror without outrageous state of mind much less all twelve\nAnd I'm looking at the backgrounds of these jurors for instance the Simpson for person was in the Nineteen Ninety LA county employee of the year I'm listening to what they said on radio and TV reading a book written by three of them I get no sense that even one of them had that state of mind and I don't believe that for one single moment so\nThis was not the best jury but they would have responded to an a plus performance what happened here is that the prosecution allowed this jury to live with their conscience they did not eliminate for this jury all possibilities of symptom being found not guilty\nAlright uh had not the whole of the Rodney King business and the the riots and all the rest of the been hanging over this which was right on how much difference with that ...\nWell no question about it that affected the verdict but again again invariably we come back to the unbelievable incompetence of these prosecuting here's what Cochran debt and it was duplicitous on his part and went right over the head of ... who's a black went right over his head dar\nA Cochran argued to this jury a police frame up from their experience of police brutality\nPolice brutality and ... frame of our two completely different types of misconduct Darden never distinguish these two types and the jury's mind\nUh what the black community has been experiencing throughout the years from a small segment of the LAPD and other major forces around the country maybe two or three or four percent that stay in the blue uniform of the other officers what they'd been experiencing\nIs excessive force police brutality and then of course the police lie to cover it up okay that's what they've been experiencing frame ups frame up by the police for burglaries robberies rapes murders virtually virtually unheard of it's not that it's not common I Know this I've talked to enough black\nI've talked to people who work in the black community that's almost unheard of\nYet ... did not see this issue\nTime magazine did not see the issue time said well obviously it was easy for this jury to buy the frame of argument\nAll the jury had to replay in their mind is the tape of Rodney King get be getting beaten by the LAPD has the Rodney King getting getting beaten by the LAPD in the same thing as the LAPD other word is if the LAPD beating Rodney King is essentially the same as they're framing OJ Simpson who totally completely different types of police misconduct\nAnd it's my belief without knowing that\nThis jury back on the jury one was thinking this is the LAPD we know we can't trust them you know there is a reasonable doubt or they may have framed OJ instead of thinking to themselves wait a while yeah maybe we can't trust the LAPD for certain things but frame ups\nThat's absurd I was on a San Diego radio last week and a fifty five year old black fifty five year old black woman called in and she was carrying and to me you know about the the the LAPD in the San Diego police department the mystery blacks and I said no ma'am\nAnd and she believe there is a frame of and all that I said man I'm going to ask you a question now and I want you to think about it I don't want you to answer right away I think about it before you answer\nYour fifty five years of age I Want you to get a look back into your past has that ever happened to you or any member of your family any relative any close friends\nHave they ever been framed in other words are completely innocent the police come along if they ever been framed for a burglary or a robbery or rape and arson or murder I'm not exaggerating art she paused for five ten seconds and these were words no\nShe hadn't thought about it you fall sure and and garden\nShould have pointed this out to the jury it would have been in a looming eighty moment for all of them he didn't do it and went right over his head\nDuring look we're near the top they are but I Want to ask you very quickly wants to trial got underway was their juror targeting\nI Can't tell you I mean I got it right I I don't know that that I Would always say you're you're\nTargeting I mean targeting by both sides were they both are or were they both playing games and ... off they didn't say we're a favorable to their\nThat oh yeah of course that it's not an every trial it's called a a a primary challenge where you don't have to give any reason whatsoever if you don't like the way someone looks at you the color of their time\nNo no I'm Talking about wants to trial was underway\nTrials underway yeah there was a little bit of that\nUh but it wasn't too successful because Ito was not a\nDischarging people are ... unless he came up with some evidence of possible impropriety you know one of them was\nWell I'm recalling the or the ... the er the anonymous letter\nYeah right but I mean he was under the impression that perhaps this woman uh was going to write a book I Wonder if she was or not I don't know but there was some evidence that went in that direction and uh yes the defense wanted to get rid of her of course 'cause she was perceived to be pro prosecute manage needle you know didn't just willy nilly a discharge or\nMore I learn where we're at the top of the hour give me thirty more minutes 'cause I've got a couple more questions okay All right good ones and gee a boy

staying I Know you've got an early interview a nonstop interviews I guess [laughter] um this again relates to the Simpson trial it's an important question was there anything\nIn ... track record or background that should have set off warning bells to guilt varsity before selecting them to do the prosecution\nWell I had never heard of either one of them before but that that really doesn't mean anything 'cause we have a thousand prosecutors the da's office here in LA and there's one central office about Eighteen outline offices all I have since learned that Clark was perceived to be among the top prosecutors doc da's office\nOne that I Know said that Chris darn was perceived to be a top prosecutor why he was brought on the run on the case I don't know\nHe did handle the a C colon calling the situation in front of the grand jury when the d._a. was contemplating seeking indictment against calling so we got a little background there 'cause I was a an ancillary\nA part of this case whether colleagues would be indicted for being an accessory after the fact murder sure and then there was also the argument that whether he was a token black\nBut uh I can tell you a little bit about his background because I checked into it at least the seven years prior to the trial\nAh he told the jury I'm Talking about ... I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years well I happen to know that the da da da and the Rodney King situation was no exception I can just about guarantee you are that\nIf there hadn't been a tape there by that George holiday they anyone second tape ... private citizen no one would have ever heard the name uh Rodney King\nA fact Rodney king's brother when I went up to the foot he'll division of the LAPD the day after the the beating\nAnd this was before the LAPD knew about the tape and he um\nHe wanted to file a complaint against these officers in the death stars and said look your brothers and a lot of trouble there wasn't going to be any finally and again for officers in any event one guard and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking well wait a wise is this in the middle of the night or with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside Darden and the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting police misconduct cases here so they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven in Nineteen Ninety four garden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even if only case a and he lost it it's a thirty ninth and don't and street case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThat was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trashed it looking for crack and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it and lost that case and if you look at his book you mentioned a lot of cases in his id\nAh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if you've read very closely with thirty ninth adults treat gay so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nSo then what are you saying because of color\nWell I don't know I don't really don't know why I was brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh\nUh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that when he told the jury I been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth he was investigating bad cops or seven years but not prosecuting them\nAs long as public image was lousy uh as I watch the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip on a fault zone [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful Louis articulated there aren't let me give you one one just unbelievable example of\nOf incompetence up between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this of this type of thing you're aware of the ... of the van editor ah bringing the vial of blood back to Iraq and if you're aware of that whole that whole issue\nOh yes okay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a monthly or sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime and murder\nAnd I'm a ... so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ...\nAnd he could have done that however normally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist for someone to the search warrant\nHere that hadn't been done yet a a fun was still at Rockingham first he's been a Bundy collecting evidence\nAnd evidence is booked sequence surely a\nBy numbers so at the book that while\nIt would have been item number one but what the reason he didn't do that as he had no way of knowing what number a phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting at Bundy and walking him it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you can read it around and had opportunity a impossible\nYeah right ah but yes\nBut it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests not one citizen complaint against them in twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife read it to his farm in Indiana and he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence in a capital case in California and testified falsely you can get the death penalty yourself on her one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument and in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a batter brings the vile blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the\nTo the criminalist in their mind that's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here a white bought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of please frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators took blood out of that violin planted them ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the\nTire case okay now there are several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about Ben and bringing them all blood back the Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring the vial of blood back the rock and have obviously he put it in his pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense on number two number two\nVan out are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham and Bundy their cameras blanketing the premise is picking up for the evening news all\nThe movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other argument now what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive than\nIn the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court defense argument about ban that are bringing the vial of blood back to Rockingham they never once even touched on that issue\nI check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nWhen you get to the point when you don't have an open up your mouth and author one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard I wouldn't say that you were incompetent incompetence of showing up for work\nDoing a bad job right well we didn't even argue on it but they're not even showing up for what about the angle that\nA a ride Bennett are carried it out in the world but a lot of people thought well ferman socked away a little bit of but remember the song business and took it over and planted it that's what the what\nI saw the glove ... the the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder scene before fun before affirmative ferment arrived rapid two o'clock and it's right at the these murders happen around a oath whether there's a disc right there there's a\nDivision and you know but but\nSomewhere somewhere between ten Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of during the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there\nFor ... to pick up and deposit at Rockingham ... even if you wanted to even if you will\nNot to frame Simpson by planning to go there was no second glove there unless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for for men now\nMind you Eighteen officers say they all they all made the statement at ... in front of a a a internal affairs but but uh but Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling the other sixteen she had the other sixty in there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call it that stand the greater the likelihood that all Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case\nAnd so had been rehabilitated film art for the sake of argument that these girls are rehabilitated the never do it again or I'm not an opposition to make any assessment of that I haven't seen them personally and since Nineteen Seventy one\nWhere people are are not thinking clearly here is that there are still mean when you're rehabilitated you're entitled to be set free is that that's the only reason why we incarcerate people write it certainly that's one of the reasons we put people behind bars\nAnd a lot of the you know there's punishment that they're still\nWondering why they want us punishment and want to talk about politics that we're talking about justice I mean people say this is fine but retribution as you know that's prehistoric or whatever it is how can you have justice without retribution\nJustice is just a mess that stick way sane retribution and punishment that's another reason why I put on by out of the main reason the courage to set an example that's right we we put people behind bars we punish them at the top prospect tip

point ma'am thank you very much let me think about that a little bit\nLet's all think about that a little bit if\nOne of our ... our our intelligence agencies had received a written threat prior to that just prior to the downing of this aircraft that said this could have been or could be\nAirforce one or may be air force one ... in less the following would such a threat be related to the general public I Would like to think that we have an open government\nThat would ah would would tell us about such a thing but frankly I don't believe that\n\nAnd I'm not altogether sure that they should tell us about such a threat backed up with the obvious reality of the downing of flight eight hundred if it was brought down by a missile\n\nThen you can be damn sure there is more missiles\nWe um we\nInjected good proper word a lot of missiles into Afghanistan a lot of ... which we then in recent years last couple of years we've been trying to buy back from the mujahedeen of course many of these missiles no doubt made their way\nOut to Iran\nThere's no question about that [noise] no not accusing Iran of ah being behind the downing of flight eight hundred\nBut these missiles are definitely on the loose they're out there and I presume that if you've got the money\nYou can certainly get your hands are on a missile you got enough money today in this world you can buy just about anything up to and possibly even including nuclear devices so to get a stinger missiles with enough money I think is not a big problem is it\nSuch a wonderful world\nWe live in today\nInto our bill

I Can't imagine it'd be fifty two maybe I'm always\nThe one who knows I mean I'm not familiar with playing\nAll right sir thank you um I Know a B. fifty twos old and I know that they it seems\nTo me that a B. fifty two came after shortly after World War two and besides it'd be fifty two so damn big that I don't see how it could be hidden anywhere it must have been another aircraft um\n\nI Know that it'll be fifty two has been our standby bomber for a very very long time and they're really quite ancient\n\nUh but I don't think there's that ancient\nWorld War two because we uh no they they certainly weren't we delivered the atomic bombs\nBut to Japan or at the end of World War two not in a B. fifty two and a half had we had to be fifty two then that would have been the aircraft of choice without question most of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nYeah I'm calling from Anchorage\nAnchorage, Alaska Yes sir\nOkay hey our I Want to ask you a favor I have this problem I work in broadcasting and I bought the kind of a jerk and everybody at work but you know it'd be pretty rude cruel I Want to stay in the business though um [noise]\nI just feel like I should move on\nWell there's a lot of that in broadcasting uh so what advice are you seeking I mean how can I help you\nWell you mentioned earlier that you wanted to talk about people that leave their jobs for no reason or you know they just\nDon't know reason I mean just people who have quit you know\nYeah well I'm One of those people I kind of move on from job to job place to place but I Want to kind of federal and\nWell that's broadcasting my friend or if you know it's a career that ah I did it for many many many many years all over the place all over the world and in fact in broadcasting and I'm not sorry about it but there came a point in my life where I had enough\nYeah so um\nI'd be worried about getting that by all the M.

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached the arm out\nNo I was not quite I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is it now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surrounding that was my first experience\nWas relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this and my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... you need that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of ... and yes\nAnd but you can experience at first and and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't just stopped here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and we're all in the tens information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah out all human and has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean the because usually not a language to\nReally clearly defined what another mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd it all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits or this or that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel\nIs the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I call it in Asheville tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way

they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over\nOr their vibrating or they're hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nYou know important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to these travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travels\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each or we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nA mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire

thousand participants who have gone to the ... e training and and then really the genius\nAnd he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the Cleveland was when he picks lanes and then this for audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years so um but I've been studying\nThis in practice in it for forty or just to go on my website astro info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet\nBut there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted or touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you have an accident your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's the dance on because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now the ... you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen unexplored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during it out of\nBody experience ... image\nYou're looking at it's amazing that same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you want to animals sleep they are changing and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences are is natural his breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... bc it temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game\nBut very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you hear me now in imagination\n... that's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and I was still\nLearning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master\nWe're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time and um my point is that when Austin will get\nInformation given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this as one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important yes\nBecause all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational wines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and any\nSaying that left backed up special your religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe that you would have been born\nIn India ah eh we're had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational\nPowerful experience and it's very self empowering\nMm need in now back to the report that you had you talked about these common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of body experience for ... years old and he put ... recount they're changing and it's often repeated experience it happens over and over again but it declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it for the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his terrible news that we\nHave our ... and you realize it's you know there's so much reporting stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest\nProblem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge itself if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day\nI knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars are being not nervous after none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that would be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond you go\nYeah we we

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative energy if if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well well you are creative\nBeings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I don't remember but he could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took on a helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\n... owns a motorcycle and\nHe was and he woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the name was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which\nLooks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we can't each other yeah I Do know is that an adult well out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there was a object to\nThere is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time writing the gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our\nContinuing existence yes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much William this has been great if you go to his website which is astro info dot org you'll find out about all of his books and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to attack about ghosts of Colorado and some of the great history with the forgotten ... Sylvie back I only see you're listening to coast to coast and [noise]\nHim all the time and ... says the reasons are myriad ticket prices are too high food costs too much it's easier to watch the game at home\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am so Mike yesterday her website it's called ... two legends dot com and I love the beginning of it it does [laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history tours Ruben probably scaring the public since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie Lisa\nI'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the ... out of it it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really say pee on an erosion is is that there's a sharing anyway come to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience\nWith her normal\nWell this this I've been seeing go since I was ... an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding\nAnd after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and a unite the paranormal ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend or a fence\nAnd she said professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from the other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we we\nCall it a little faith because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians because what we do is actual real history\nSo even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the night [laughter] supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles sport and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mystery than he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that\nWhat I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually published my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies\nAnd it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through you're going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life with goats what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you've you've I see it and I actually feel it I guess ...\nLike humans to my examples that\n[laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny that I can actually send things [noise]\nUm I'm In path I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I hadn't very ex I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head\nWhere was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while\nAnd about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was taunted and so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying\nSo she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown\n[laughter] extremely run\nDown and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house in five years\nAfter five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you well after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd an artist you know and it's very severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] yeah so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this is before she died and then he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest the state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was epic\nMy goodness you you do things a little out Louis\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost\nOf Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believe me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about story jelly so now you still live in managed to springs right just a little of the history of that area\nWell that's I Believe that says one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here where we live in the Rockies and um so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of vanity springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have in my house is shaking my head and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious but the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up and he um\nYou can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it ... the he was saying he was speculating that maybe\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner\nBy like diving into buildings and in like ... pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am the

A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storage or as we can tell but she's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you what we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um\nI think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nI went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that it is no law that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] needing now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball in this book was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nBad yes but you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast today [laughter]\nYou I have made it is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goals but like other little girls that bounces the ball isn't she do I'm like no\nLeave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you and your tricks to improve\nTheir it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um\nOr at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye is that in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night ... that is the best time\nIs a transition time why it's\nThe if the lighting and if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right San ... an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows is that makes sense\nYes that does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast right now and then\nI got like it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we had a beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rack and that led to the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the place that you're living in now haunted him did you met with non hunt\n... and the gas or the ghost follow you\nWrite that they do on like two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend said well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of that trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this this town is very hunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYou get to you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tree of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the uh did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh yeah oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic trick them no really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nThere are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and absolutely ss\nPart rain there oh yeah that you know this family hotel right there on that a native them it's very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managers springs and bolder and even as to part with ... with the infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light up\nLight up with the red energy I find that very interesting you need all the natives used to call this the spine of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountain this very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine as you're right there in the center of the country\nYeah the central part of the pikes peak they believe was the naval\nOf the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very low fat Ernie I read this stuff pikes peak it's very popular\nAnd it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know

waters and we're talking about Colorado legends in lower\nAnd when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of lead to lure but this particular one because\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know to be [noise]\n[noise] well um pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. a\nTiVo or have a I think that's what the native youth used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nWhine whine and we've been called that connected to the mother okay yeah it's connected to the\nMother and think about the native is the way that they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get\nUm father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out from the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThe and the natives knew that if they are of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold rush\nA produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you ... I Love the show ancient aliens and they talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado there were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards about the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hungry and they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brush it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOur governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically\nSack light up and down sideways hampering you know like a helicopter ...\nA fascinating and they didn't know what till they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere weren't a lot of people out yet but a lot of people thought this I mean just outrageously crazy and he followed his story we're in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know when farmers\nIn Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um what we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as a the director of the paranormal convention and one of my friends is named Dan ... and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed at the he actually had some big hair [laughter] and I'm Dan has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal\nAnd he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick clips and the rocks and I've been back there with him and so all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know or why not\nHave you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend he pulled it it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believes that his property is a poor hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that maybe big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's\nComing in and out or maybe we're seeing 'em meaningless seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and goes and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher\nBecause that's what I Am and I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the name of course like a Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature Bigfoot now would say [laughter] I wouldn't have gone Chinese would know\nThat there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the ... Native American Indians depending on where they lived in the Rockies where they relocated a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand but I mean\nThat's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense you know if all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it just like to call it\nUm you know that is just a name that it's been come up with in the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm not my Christian more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the manager she springs area and garden of the gods and the areas near pikes peak\nWhere that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out or\nSpecial people make the middle is

Institute in Virginia\nAnd William cells as they set aside the therapist and he guides you do these incredible states as consciousness and I personally know that they exist from my experience they'd love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me William\nHow are you feeling good aid\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such that I had out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience to go back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nI explored um and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first\nHoly conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your family who had to leave your tire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality has shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a hit and the therapist\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first\nAnd uh I've I've had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades\nBut the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after a series of days went by a one day I\nWas sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this\nBut you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I\nDid you think we reached beyond that oh\nNo I was nonsensical I I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew\nI was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah\nWell it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained answers for yourself ... ... ...\nI think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't get me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of ... and\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know incredible as our our world is and you know incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the information to be seen me why would universe just create one type of human being it doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention\nAll at once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional mhm and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah not all human and it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was playing because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an addict and mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd it all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by salt and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere is no um when I teach my classes are there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow you're listening you teach and then really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great invasion home only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I mean each person is in a check
