uh his Web is net a and his uh focus again on the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend he immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist

with a new work it's an art ... big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think Dave is probably not likely to take a position on

like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh [noise] there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always\nReading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles infection\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the article but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will the wild man and I had done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archive for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not lifting ten years ago when you were first here can you recap the hoop a project how you got started on that\nWhat you learned and how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for\nTechnology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I and what about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that there would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help or write a white paper about this\n[noise] and during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was ... than a crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba to a very brilliant scientist who has written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it [noise] and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh they\nAre made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old uh Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows house Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find an archive news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into that\nQuote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some exporters wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked at him I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy bike he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it

you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky\nA large black wild white mass landed in a field releasing a huge hair

I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just plan to playing with fire\nSo think about\nUm let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nI think from the mid Eighteen hundreds\nAnd I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans do sort of chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it since it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nDogs you know I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big ... a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of fruit um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives\nAre in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and I got two hundred and fifty pound deer native guy could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast it goes down\n...\nFind out more about it I guess to log on to ...\nSign you know who you're going to be done or\nMay be hard to believe but people just like you are already sending money to being knocked over makes it easy near symbols savings land teaches you how to start saving without going overboard so you don't need to ditch the car and start rollerblading to work [noise]\n[noise] ...

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take film\nOr anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute\nThat think about today nobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a big foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on a PG film yet today there's probably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrion smartphone\nWhich has the ability to catch that\nSo I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe the ... film is real why haven't we caught this by pat on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this one did they won't hang around and lingering knowing the people are watching him something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back the skin Walker day but it the the comparison is pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there are cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it attached to it\nUm the description from the tribes that you mentioned in your books suggest this thing has camouflage abilities that he can poke itself the change of shapes and it can hide\nCorrect that's again

are Sarah black and acclaim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere in New York\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was the ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could ... I thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and then no one told the story you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who is the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to me that the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean yeah I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visit them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with Sarah on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very tight and project from either way I got involved when\nI had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work\nAnd I had been praying have\nOpportunity to work on an iconic ... story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive to get this email from that young filmmakers mum Sarah glad it\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm going into an apple is a storyteller she wanted to render the story as the screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a and a three part series and stick to a major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the ... and a brother that we only the many\nAreas on but so you're going to need right if I have seen writer I don't know how to write a family and friends she read that and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I made a veteran now that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that he was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] [noise] ...\nThat I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then a green to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and um and then when we did it like a project and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the that the people who had who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nOf what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it with to tell the whole story of this shit\nYou know she'd been reduced to a sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did um besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab ... my father was a ... at ... landing craft from those ships to good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah get most of the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us in our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty sick injured and that was what really sent her on the states will journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters of the book obviously didn't survives you're basing them together I guess from people who didn't know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back and land on an apple store it hasn't really man before it gets back and not as it is and you know\nCircled back and the men who marry the atomic bomb aboard the Annapolis when an army name Robert an army major name Robert burning\nAnd yet at the last couple of years of war running down all of the material that they hear the Germans when you try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of Europe\nNo one in one and then burn and very component the little boy in island um that is final breathing yet or you're an end the conflict and so\nIn writing the book we tried to hold back Atlanta than bringing in a lot of other a character and world leaders and figure\nIncluding the Japanese pointed addition to hash matter we had in for the call and tell me you've got ...\nCommander and what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and fiction and doing well\nI'll tell you what I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes down\nOh look back this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named Annie

D board somebody\n\n\n\n\nSaloon Vincent I interrupted you before the break we were about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYes a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more sports that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of\nJapanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from commander how she noticed point of view and there was a chapter on is devoted to Indianapolis but because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nHe was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking\nFor radar and more technology for his that marine because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers account because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored because\nThe shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food all just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost\nThe end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap or a three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so\nAny water that was available with only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of\nMen who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nWere starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nTo send them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you know take small for it is that the the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels for blood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or that was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess you immediately that it did so quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because it could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have ... ... who ends up testifying at the\nOr partial later or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... survey you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With friends and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the general death in the cockpit within minutes late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they the the you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action do you think well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess the same kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd have still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they had a son who you know the gentleman richer the Francis have passed away but it's done carries on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time\nAnd we're at the one he thought it and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents terrible ethic about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster and us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing
