also known is hurting has become one of the fastest growing hobbies across North America and its field a boom in travel and tourism can cast made is an avid murder who's written dozens of books including his own field guide series the caffeine field guides and he led many bird tourists to all sat in confidence\nHe's also a frequent keynote speaker at many perverted nature events and he's joining us now\nHello Ken I'm told your frequent listener reverse shows so thank you and welcome to our world travel\nBoth thanks so much uh yeah I'm very interested in travel and all of you guys are the experts on the authorities so I Love your show will\nAppreciate that very much so and so we've never done a segment on this program dating back to its inception in two thousand four on voting kind of surprised me and it's the reason why we asked our producer Valerie to coordinate your parents from your experiences and travels how big do you think the burning industry is and why does it continue the growing popularity\nHuge actually I mean there have been surveys and studies trying to quantify it all the way there are more than forty five million people in the United states who are bird watchers of course a lot of them do that in the backyard but others are due to travel element to it\nAnd putting groceries and two thousand eleven almost Fifteen billion dollars were spent by bird watchers during their travel well lodging in transportation\nI think that's pretty big now that you can for people listening I think\nYou know there may be the sort of a misnomer that you need to travel to exotic parts of the world to enjoy hurting but there are three areas right here in the U.S that are outstanding destinations and I know that you've written about NATO that you've been to\nA central New Mexico the central Texas coast north\nEastern Florida which I'm not sure how effective they weren't with the hurricane that might be a little bit more challenging this week\nBut can you just give us a quick factor two or three areas\nI'm sure yeah that's especially relevant right now because a lot of them thinking about a National Wildlife refuges and National Wildlife refuge\nStarts tomorrow and October for it so it runs in the ... but anyway uh I'm from New Mexico the book though Apache National Wildlife refuge is an amazing area for wintering bird like fans feel ...\nAnd ... and it is your favorite with just just amazing and less opportunities\nThere the central Texas coast\nAround the national wildlife refuge\nIs the best place in the world including crying and they were there there's a big clock but the northern Canada migrate south central to spend the winter it around\nAnd on the whole area that was hit by Hurricane Harvey in August of two thousand Seventeen and they're still rebuilding ... some of the areas where it rough but\nIf you go there the bird watching with great them by going into whether you're a poor economy and help rebuild and then uh over in northeastern Florida\nOne of my favorite spots as a merit island National Wildlife refuge and one thing about that is a great shape your\nVisiting like Disney World or some of the other tourist attractions around la land though with family and we want to get away for bird watching Merritt Island is very close\nTo do there are some last year I went to moslem Mexico for the show and on the plane with me were a group of voters heading offer their annual trip and that gave me a real idea on how big this industry is about five years ago I was staying at a hotel in South central Iceland hotel rang HeLa Iceland\nI when I woke up one morning I stood on the balcony I was looking out the volcano I noticed this white creature sitting on a kind of a small amount\nAnd the contrast stark to me because the whole rest of the year he was moss Iraqi with some grass in the stream it turned out to be a snow well I can tell you that wingspan so surprised me was huge it was such a truly beautiful creature to see flying can I mean\nThat's my experience so what's your favorite burning experience\nThousand favorite I'm sure you do\nThis but I always feel like my favorite is the next one are just so many possibilities out there\nI mean I think in my backyard and all but especially just traveling around the U.S there's so many opportunities I guess one of my favorite if you're a big concentration of bald eagles are up on the edge of Lake Erie being able to see some of the\nBirds the one that no one bald eagles my guess is that when you get a group\nGroup well Ken listen I Am going to be real curious to see what kind of reaction we get from our audience with regards to today's discussion of burning it certainly is you know popular thing for travelers so we'll look forward to staying in touch with even having your back in the future okay so I have a nice day\nOr cook life I'll look forward to tank you can\nOr he was such a nice man interest Seventeen bald eagles to see them now I cannot and must be seen as one of the great Korean how should we should let us know what you think about\nThat if we were going to be curious to know more about it at the clock ticks down that's going to wrap things for this week connect with them any time on Twitter linked in Instagram and Facebook and fought in world travel\nSpecial thanks to all of our guests here in the show today with Mary Rudy me next door shut seem network affiliates sponsors certainly all of you out there who helped make what we do America's number one travel radio show you may be headed to travel and enjoy\nListening to your are em world travel connection America's number one travel radio show on the radio network\nFive times the most from the\nStudios WVU IRAs radio station anywhere you go on the heart radio\nCalls for a credible investigation into the disappearance of a journalist I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nMuch of the world wants to know what happened to democracy okay the Washington Post contributor who vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nAnd the department of energy has a map on their website that shows you what the our values should be for the attic area\nAnd for the walls of your home in fact if you go up to a\nPlace that sells insulation that energy map is right on the bags of inflation so you can do that too so let's just say it's an hour forty two and the the insulation is maybe in our three per inch of sickness you can do some quick math and\nI can figure it's going to be around sixteen inches of insulation somewhere in that area and if you get up there and you're measuring you've got five inches of inflation you you know you get your work cut out for you\nSo can you put inflation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the insulation which I Hope you don't have\nUsually vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house and let's say you had five six inches you know you've got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down unfazed batting\nOr you can blow insulation in and you could blow a cellulose insulation and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up the soft advance\nIf he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up in fact you shouldn't insulate over it at all ever never\nIf you have older can light you want to make sure that they're protected you don't want to insulate over them\nBut for the most part not a difficult job if you want to lay bats over that's fine bats are not quite know the you know they're still going to be a gap between the would up in the addict that the Joyce the presses\nThere's going to be a little scene there where's your blown it and it's kind of film and all that area\nBut just adding insulation real good idea to get it up to speed the LA Times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are of this is remodeled should be our this but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do\nAnd also when you get up there just can't take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic\nSlime mold on the underside of the roof maybe some rotted would maybe you've got a ... issue\nMaybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in their nests was made in the insulation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got a breach somewhere in the top of that house it needs to be repaired\nAnd maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point\nBut a lot of times it's outta sight outta mind\nAnd that's not always a good option so when it comes as we say to start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable of getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do\nAn energy audit and address those issues eight hundred ... two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nIt or how you doing doing great\nRight now I'm them at all a cabin down in\nSanta Fe on the Tennessee River uh-huh I've got a guy will too but I kinda like at that rate so mental Asian uh-huh have you here what are you going to do it for you\nWrite a while and the crowd things underneath it it got on the side of a mountain though\n... won't be jumping up in the attic he wants to pray at the top of the roof of metal roofing\nOver two by four that are on that yet Mars Arnold ... over the vertical raptor for just didn't they rode out some kind of ventilation ... now shutting the inflation hung in groups filling in it mhm but I have no way to get that phone to stay up there and then do the\nDominant very restrictive spray the top of the roof okay up to the root\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that room correcting we're just going to encapsulate that whole attic area correct\nThat lady okay you know and I don't need to do any um property and selling of it that way\nThat's correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] I'm an older guy\nI'm not going there I'm not going there\nSo uh [laughter] to answer your question yeah about Fifteen Years ago a company called ... started this process of whole house in ...\nAnd and it really is it makes an entire insulated Ava low to the house\nFrom the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require suffered venting it doesn't require roofing a roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now so if you had air conditioning or heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's\nKind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever perfect the challenges that houses really sealed it's really super energy efficient you just gotta be careful that we have good I'm clean healthy air another word sometimes when we over\nA ceiling over inflated house you've heard the phrase sick building syndrome\nThat's only pollutants get trapped inside the home in the house can't breathe so one of the things you might consider down the road and you see how it goes is what they call an error exchanging and it's so it's actually bringing in some fresh air outside in a very small amount but\nClinton that you are meant to be she admits she little unit\nOkay right okay so it's exchanging air it's bringing Erin is pulling air out yeah yep that's perfect man you're going to have another cabin\nOkay well that's what I needed it now has a dollar twenty five square rent for it\nBut I really don't know I haven't had a price gal I really don't know I really don't know but you go that way I think it sounds like a great idea\nWell buddy you answered my where I came down now trendy [laughter] out well All right\nAll right I mean I have a great day thing by by by by\nRight

that was uh interested in buying a standby generator\nYeah Carl's looking for ... you got to be ... or ... I think\nYes mhm well I live in South Carolina where the summers are Ninety five boss uh-huh I'm all for\nAcres I have a Dixie chopper would again Iraq engine okay and it has a to hydraulic systems and I'll tell you what I'm five hours a day and was shot\nAnd and I bought a used outlaw more was using that way over three hours and hours on it uh-huh and\nYeah he uses\nVery good quality\nOil or the oil that interacts says to use an ad mhm I mow all day long and all that energy and doesn't use any oil whatsoever\nYou know human it sounded odd to me again I didn't read the operations manual but I asked them if both said that and he said yes\nUm but I don't know I don't know I don't know of an engine that burns up in eight hours well you know I mean it might be ... but I don't know if it's going to need additional oil\nYeah I I think I'm the reason why ... Iraq as that is as that hey what person who I'm there now what he has to do explain to people and ... installing it oh\nCan work around that again it all goes back to the quality of oil well oil you use a better job performance you're going to get\nYeah in some of the holidays or you know even longer life than they were certainly Twenty years ago\nThose Gen Iraq engines are so wild bill uh-huh have oil cooler\nI have a two so under ... solid that shaft as murder\nAnd it has a oil will around it has a an extra oil filter on it and uh like I said I I ... I ... a day and it's uh Seventy two inch long more\nSure well you're a ... fan that's for sure and one of the things I said Jim and I think you will agree obviously you love your gender reckon I get that\nA color doesn't really make junkie though that's kinda why so no no no you're not going to go wrong either way the biggest thing you can do regardless of what standby generator you get is gets a maintenance agreement and get that thing taking care of and\nYou know tip top shape ready to go because when you needed you need it now\nOh yeah and and then you don't want to say on caches skip that lasts a you know check up and now the thing in fire and but\nI just am ham ensure that he knows the installation papal sure um you know that there's a gap in areas not going to be home to and\nQuite honestly I think that's why a lot of people by the so I'd be curious to and I'll look into it also ah it seems um eight hours is just the little that is a little troubling to me\nThan the other good thing is because while they use natural gas propane sense it's not liquid fuel\nEngine oil stays absolutely clean because there's no liquid ... right and they're going to run on a show on her wall know wash out the walls or that's what causes usage because of the oil and and you start using oil so I'm\nAll right well very good thank you for your input certainly appreciate it All right eight hundred they two three eight to five five would\nKind of get in our homes ready for winter we talked a little bit about insulation we've talked a little bit about I'm a generators as you just surge standby genders we talked a little bit about ventilation\nYou know there's all kinds of places we can go from here that's for sure when it talks about to get in your home ready for\nA winter I guess one thing we got to really do is take a look at that entry door to look at the back door to look at the side door next to the garage let's see what kind of shape that is let's see if you can stand in your living room or your for your and just look up between the gym and the ... day like\nDo you feel a little breeze\nDeal look down at the bottom of the door can you feel a little drift there because those are the vulnerable areas that allow cold air into your home now there's ways to do a little test to see if there is there a filtration I talked about the thermal camera but one way you can do this is a cool little trick\nYou know wait till it gets dark at night and send your better half or friends outside and you stay inside\nAnd you get a little light and you go along the top of the door down the side of the door down the bottom of the door and your friend\nI talk about a ah the company\nI use it like for generations if they've been ripping off people a ... they wouldn't be in business for four generations but having that inspected good idea how 'bout um changing the filter do you do that regularly you should um\nAnd I'm going to be very general here but changing that filter every Ninety Days\nIs where you should be\nYou know one of those big foreign inch pleaded filled her show those good six months you get a little fifty nine cent far because once you're thirty days but most of the police didn't want you can get\nNinety Days\nSo changing that you don't need necessarily a HVAC company to do that that's something you can do you keep your calendar on your phone or if you keep a paper counter put it down on that date Ninety Days to change that silver\n\nBut having it professionally inspected and a lot of people just want to I'm just check it and make sure it's good to know a lot of people want to know what to say they have really good specials because if there is something they would like to sell your furnace\nIf you've got a good reputable H. B. C. person and they're running a special for I don't know Seventy\nEighty fifty I don't know you pick the price will inspecting clean your furnace okay and then they come and then they said well Mr Gleason your exchanging it is correct and you need a new furnace or this is done you need a new furnace\nI'm not saying everybody's a crook all I'm saying is he careful be careful yeah exactly so a lot of times they'll actually\nHave camera inspections and they'll show you the crack and then you'll say okay maybe you'll get to ... maybe you won't I don't know it's up to you but don't make a panic\nDecision if you see the correct that go ahead price that out for me\nIf you're in a situation where it's really really cold in January you got to make a panic decision right that's where you kind of want to get this out of a wing now\n\nAnd if you're not comfortable with the person telling you that it does not her to get to quotes because there's a lot going on and the furnaces there's a lot of choices to make\nAnd when we have ah let's say under pressure and I'm not just talking about pressure from the from the technician I'm Talking about pressure from the weather we don't really do the research that we need to do\nA lot of times you know what what branch should I buy you know what the real important thing is the technician you're using the company or use and I said this a few weeks ago whether it's a roofing company whether it's an H. B. C. company\nIf you're dealing from a company has been around a while has a great reputation they're not going to carry junk\nBecause they're going to warrant that for a long time and they're going to be there for you so finding that good technician that's what you want to do so\nAnyway just getting nothing inspected getting it done or the key and please if you get a carbon monoxide detector in that house\nSmoke alarm in the house you can say that\nAbout year round but it's really important in the wintertime if you're not having that furnish checked in the chimney inspected potentially there's things that can go wrong and you know we'll hear about the news\nHouses get closed up and then this family had a carbon monoxide problem and\nYou know somebody passes away somebody's ... the whole family's very sick you you want to get that taken care of and in one of the things that's interesting over the years I've done different stories and carbon monoxide if you feel like the whole families get the flu but when the kids go to school they feel fine\nAnd you know they have a carbon monoxide detector they may not have the flu they may have mild carbon monoxide poisoning 'cause that's what it's like you can smell it you can't see it but the effects the human body is flu like symptoms interesting yeah so\nUh I you know this one lady I talked to their family had a criminal oxide problem when the kids went to school and went to an overnight and one of their friends' house\nKids weren't sick lady when she went to work she was sick\nShe got home she'd be watching TV she they have a headache just feel lousy wake up the horrible good or feel good\nHuh and what it was the the the pipe then go into the chimney was clogged\nAnd didn't have an inspection and as soon as we're going right into the home so make sure you get a carbon monoxide detector that's very very important\nAh John welcome morning how are you doing good All right thanks for show you a\nCouple of questions here uh one uh [noise]\nCorral a tile floor or the or the cow for the ground in the middle or what is the best way to it's it's almost like a [noise] a why is what it used to be I'd like to bring it back Hawaii what is the best way to do that and it's kind of job\nOh yeah yeah I mean there's people that do it they'll steam cleaned ground and stuff like that but uh you can use different um like a grand a gold they make a ground in stone cleaner it's going to take some scrub than you\nCan use a Mr cleans scouring the sponge a that'll clean it and then the secret is to get that um get that sealed and that's the key getting killed so\nI mean in the path of clean it but it just seemed like material that I purchased a you know didn't clean it like a more value there yes you could always tell that it was wider over there well I'll tell\nYou what I just clean some grout um with some um granted go route\nCleaner [noise] and then I see that with the sealer and we're just talking to my wife and I were just talking about this this morning and it's amazing how it has not come back\nBecause the water ruse tells moisture penetration into that ground [noise] so it does that mold John I'll get to the rest of the question off the air we're up against the are up against the clock don't forget to\nMy favorite product got her brushed\nBut tell you what if the leaves have fallen in your house to get the leaves how they got to get him clean if they haven't politically ball and\nAt this point just wait till they completely fall and clean the gutters and get some got her brush light it didn't keep the leaves from getting into the gutter check it out it's an awesome product ... got her brush dot com and it's a hundred percent guaranteed the work how about that at all saying it back\nAnd I know they will you're at home\nA project and don't know how to finish it ... and one eight hundred eighty three talk you're at home when Harry's oh [noise]\n\n\n\nLifted up football fans mellow mushroom bakers we know that going to the big game and tailgating\nOr watching football at home is not for the faint of heart preparation is everything ... mushroom team is bad on your way to or from the game with your team was fresh mouth watering spring water do these huge ... pretzels and cold beer\nColor for takeout thin edge of the game\nColombia is historic vista and sunset\nBoulevard in Lexington would you buy a pool table\nInternet big mistake chances are it'll be low quality warp and become an level the place to buy a quality table it's going to love to Carolina pool to forget the Carolina pool tables plus seven nine five three zero five\nI thought his cell phone was we were losing him okay ah sorry about that Allen I think your cell phone died but a maybe a good tip there obviously that's a pretty much regional issue\nBut again just being aware of things that can happen is again reason to make sure that had a furnace or air handler is um inspected and maintained\nAs it has an interesting issue though isn't it isn't that amazing alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nMarilyn welcome Garry hello you for taking my call you bet we have a quick patio\nAnd annoy side of our house and about two months ago we prayed when I get on the back because we had a deal that the algae uh-huh well it's back now that I\nKind of like a skating rink and we we practice staff yesterday and we were going to do it again of course we can't get the training that we went and now\nThey're wet and forget what the hell monitor ... [noise]\n... well well hold on you use the wet and forget\nCorrect we get a rational your mind again okay did to get rid of it are no\nGood okay we got a lot of tree okay and in fact the attack\nAnd is it back in the exact same place where it was yeah\nWell that that surprises me a little bit Maryland because the wedding forget it does do a complete kill\nAnd the complete kill should I'm not going to say prevent because that's too big of a word that let's say slow down the progression of re growth\nUm so it does leave they I I guess it would leave a little bit of a film nothing that you should be able to see nothing that should be slippery but um since it is a complete kill it should take longer\nFor the ... growth to take place now you say there's a lot of woods and a lot of shade so ... so yeah so let's do this um I think that whole problem is telling us something\nWe can certainly use the wet and forget again and lemonade ... you know it works um in it'll kill it\nBut I think we need to get that brick sealed oh\nI think what's going on remember the mold the middle do the algae to fungus the like and all that keen grow unless there's moisture so we've got a shaded area we got a lot of ah\nUm dust that's on that broke we got a lot of a morning dues and ... and he keeps that brick wet\nAnd if that brick isn't a waterproof per se it wicks that moisture in and it's um it holds that brick or holds that water net brick for a longer period of time so we get to\nA mold the bill doing everything off and then we use a brick ceilings\nOr brick waterproof and 'cause you don't really want to seal it you want to allow water from the backside to transfer through it but the rain water you want to keep it from absorbing into the brick and then I think what will have is we'll have that problem pretty much fixed up\nNorth side of the house and it kind of year we ... we hardly ever get any\nSense right right right All right how old is the house\nOr the happy forty eight years old okay but couldn't now patio with credit and last fall okay but we did not feel it\nOkay so this is on the patio this is on the floor so kind of have urged right\nYeah we had company can now not done it yeah one name and what is your\nDad yeah it yeah you need to get that sealed there's no question about it so you can get out and so we can spray the wedding forget on their if you'd like or if you want something um that's immediate so you can do it you know in a day or two\nUm we could use like a high grade a a missionary cleaner in fact there's a website let me just give you that Marilyn and you can decide which way you want to go okay we know the wedding forget work so but we also know it's going to take four weeks to get it to clean and this time of year we might want to move a little bit faster\nSo I've had to do that when I get\n...

Woodley and South Carolina homes and land realty I told you for years have I ever decided to sell my home I'd be calling lands well my wife and I decided it was time and of course we call that you've already going back to talk about Lance now I've heard so many great success stories and talked to so many people\nWho've got their homes sold quickly and for top dollar that we weren't concerned but we weren't ready for what happened in\nOur homes sold contracts fullest price in twenty four hours full list price\nLand to Italy and his team itself into homes and land really this is what they do for everybody they do it day in day out they've been doing it for years local realtors who know the market they know how to price you're home get ready for sale and by the way so covered they'll sell your home at a price and a deadline you agree to it that doesn't happen Lance will buy it for cash\nNumber to call eight oh three four o seven thirty eight eighty three eight oh three four o seven three eight eight three the website Lance Woodley dot com that's Lance willing to do what we did start packing\nOn memory\n\nThere are plenty of new options when it comes to making a call the newest announced this week the razor phone to rumored for the past\nFew weeks the Android powered smartphone is aimed at gamers and as a five point seven two inch Indian galleons zinc oxide LCD type of screen that improves refresh speed color gamut and resolution\nThat is covered in Gorilla Glass five in packs in Dolby audio and also packs eight gigabytes of onboard ramp and a paper chamber cooling system\nSo you can get the power you need for your games without the heat there is a front facing eight mega pixel camera and on the back to twelve mega pixel cameras and an illuminated logo that can change colors the razor too will sell for eight hundred bucks later in the here razor will ship the rise you controller for an additional hundred fifty dollars\nThat looks a lot like a standard video game controller that'll hold onto your phone while you play with box on tech I'm Brett Larson Fox News\nThis project of the week is brought you buy the metal roofing alliance [noise] All right back to where we go thirty three minutes after the top of their you're at home with Gary Sullivan\nAs we get into the heating season um I Know a lot of people will be calling in their back bedrooms will be cold and they're upstairs will be cold and they want to know why and they just bought this a super energy efficient furnace and a\nYou know they're they're they're um mother heating building go down that much and they'll call no so you know what's going on\nNow he's talking about the whole system you know you're buying the furnace the heat air and uh you got a system of duct work pipes that run through out the house that distribute the heated air that you just pay for\nBut it's out of the heat it there doesn't get to those rooms and doesn't help you much right and if that furnaces real efficient but you're losing that heated air along the highway of duck or it's not very efficient as\nSo that's why we brought in Tracy Martin and she is with a company called arrows seal and you can check this out at arrows seal dot com but Tracey ... helped me out what what's going on there\nWas a scary and thinks that had an ... what's going on I mean you you nailed it at ... at ... the air and temperature control on the air but without the highway I mean the as you put it but that part to deliver it to\nAll of the living space in there and he had little holes along the way that air is creeping are leaking out and it's kind of like a garden mhm and you want water to get at the end of that right\nYeah and if you have a ... it's not going to work very well ray got all the horrors that exactly yeah so I don't know if you've got the data for this but do give me your thoughts on it\nA typical home we got a gamut of age tomes out there um would you say most people's stuff work is compromised\nYeah actually I Do have debate on me and a half from the department of Energy Department of energy estimates that ... Ninety five percent of home ... got to work and in other than that can happen that's out there and then you know you might hear someone say well I have a ...\nMinute African late yeah\nWell that's just because you put two pieces of anything the gathering prone to having you know ...\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't do this but I was Seventeen years old my job was to run Duckworth [laughter]\nAnd I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right that when we put those two foot pieces together we'd have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of ... sitting in the ... and certain states across the country have courage now that require that for me the old when ... when\nYou were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duck work at our home so we need newer technology duck works that probably help huh\nIt when that OK Harris yeah how\nAre they going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes the leaky a duck work if we changed it you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that is true All right so I'm ... so it's a good bet that every one that's listening\nThey're not getting the efficiency of that furnace they're not getting that heated there to the places they want so what is there a seal\nWell I feel is a technology that was developed about Twenty years ago a by the department of energy actually uh-huh yup down at the UC Berkeley lab mhm um and it was it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient ... that the best way to put it\nTo fill up those tiny holes and crack a that our our typical and into an adopted system mhm\nAnd also at the at the long term uh you know almost permanent type solutions once you do this technology ah it failed up the duct work and it's guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test it to last up to forty or so in most cases\nUh as long as you're going to be in your home right right so it's kind of a line or well kind of I I some people\nTo simplify it look at it like kind of like six of flat in a way it's okay but\nAnd to be real precise about it it doesn't actually coat the duct work when it does is it signed those holes okay like they have a balloon pop a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure on different right right uh\nOur technology and able to find those holes and then he alone from the outside in negative air pressure exactly that's exactly right\nYeah ... ...\n... is that right okay All right yeah so ah so I had just done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\n[noise] Thirteen Years ago now and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal that install net I'm assuming that you go to air sold dot com\n... dot com and there's a locate or they're\n... so called is called me up when I say I want you to check my ...\nMhm thanks a A R a system itself will check to see how leaky the duck forget so we do a before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine and they can run a test\nTo see what they charge you ... you know nobody can blower door to us for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests can alert okay I'm ... different dealers approach it differently or you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find a you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find well\nUh one of the easiest of course you mentioned it right when we began to the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal for that that far room to be colder than the rest of the house is\nWe all have busy lives the smart security like maximus lady can help get instant

fascinating\nProduct I'm Talking to Tracy Martin She is with arrows seal and talking about a eliminating leaky duck work and uh you know you're paying for that either there so let's make sure gets to where it's supposed to be you know if I'm buying a new furnace and they're probably going to be a lot of people buying new furnaces here in the next month\nYou know I mean we turn us like just you know the blowers battered I mean you couldn't just I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here but people find out that I found out last year my furnace was bad just about this time and it's kind of like ugh but when you're working with an H ... guy\nI'm can he\nChecked the duck worker getting getting because like if I'm buying a high efficiency foreigners and I got crummy duck\nWork he he he you know can he helped me at all\nHe sure can and there are so many different ways to check for evidence of\nHow your deck working you know performing how and how healthy in the ... there are simple tools and thinking that a lot of contractors Carrie it's caught a smoke prefer okay yeah all it is it's exactly what it sounds like it's a little too but that will blow smoke and find air current\nFor example if you put your hand up to\n... you were talking about that experience ... right right\nSee smoke coming out All right shouldn't be anything below and right right and you you turn on that smell pepper ... you see that it's blowing either sucking it in or pushing it out\nThat's not a good thing and that's one half an infrared\nA new ... why I asked this question so you don't have to have the big blow tests that I had\nNo you do not eating not\nSo they shooter infrared camera on a wall and all of a sudden you got a big old red line going right through the middle you're on like what's that all\n... that's like Superman right behind the wall and the heat and\nCool and like you got to register behind the wall and that's not helping anybody\nThat's right that's exactly right\nSo in all HVAC guys carry those kind of ...\nYeah and more and more these days mhm and but as a homeowner I Would ask and I would ask how are you going to help me make sure that that the piece of equipment is going to work with to what are you doing to address my duct work because they know how important it is it that equipment\nAnd we also know Ninety five percent of the people have leaky Duckworth decorate cells so we already know you're not getting your value when you buy the new economical for you\nKnow what else carry the a lot of that a lot of the equipment manufacturers now in their consumer literature there now including warnings about the importance of it that brick right and they're saying there are things that can do if it causes our economy fishing the drained sugar sure you ask about your duct work sure\nBecause they got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent furnace has not lowered my eating bill one bit yet that the wire tapping yeah sure you're right All right so if you are buying a furnace and it's getting installed talk about talk to you technician really\nAbout a thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leaky dj because otherwise you're not going to get the value of that I'm highly efficient furnace if you're living in an older home and you got um\nA coup spots throughout the again\nGet a hold of an HVAC guy let him do a thermal imaging thing go to\n... dot com in a you can find somebody that's uh um skilled at a installing this particular thing and you say the ... usually in around the three years yeah on average yeah that that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're a perfect duck working in a nice\nNice uh efficient furnace and I have air sealing the duck we're\nAll right Gary I can do this one in my sleep you know good good I was thinking to myself that might be an unfair question right off the top down now right at\nKind of thing because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do all of the things that that are on sale can do and plenty that can be one of our two of the things that when they break it down for every now\nAnd if you're a

to Scott because one of the things I was going to interject\nAnd I ran into this a number of years ago when I talked about thermal imaging is um you know somebody brought up at all you can get a nap and download that on your phone there's a big quality difference in the app on the phone versus buying a thermal imaging camera or\nThis is actually ... cameras that you plug in your your USB\nPort

rich welcome\nGarry show thank you\nWe have a a theater fence that we put a twelve years ago and when we put it up we painted and now it's at the point where it needs to be re saying well Kay my only question is does it matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm\nGoing to guess that's pretty I'm pretty much a mute point at this point to probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just ah\nMaking sure it's a really clean and that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up um that can be done fairly easily I'm using an oxygen native bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use of would break near\nThat really opens up the wood fibers ... no matter what you use use acrylic\nOr whether you use a oil base um it'll get it'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's gonna last longer\nRight but uh if you had an oil based on the only time you know there's always there's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that there is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names is is it is neither in oil\nBase Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun um in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon that lasts like seven years it's good stuff but if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it\nUh but if it's just an oil in like a ton of moral base or\nEven ... base or or water base at this point I think just getting a noxious ... would break ground there you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great for one another question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fun\nWell that my friend is is ... I don't know but I'm all about that first you gotta know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're all\nAnd K well maybe money [laughter] they ... they had a certain operating like us at that point and go and ... thanks guy you've had by by maybe a spray\nOr maybe it's a prayer would be cheaper than paying the grandkids it'd probably be a little bit better job just saying I don't know you don't know yeah you're hanging with the grandkids right yup All right good man good man\nAll right it's eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab a line as we talk a little bit about home improvement remodeling repair\nAgain it's eight hundred and eight two three eight to five five lines are open so have added Terry welcome\n[noise] hello yes my now you're talking about can get one thing all at the bottom and then the one that didn't have the smaller ones some place [noise] you know what's wrong with the mode\nWhere I come down on some kind of a guy come K. and I can't can't fall let their band at all okay all\nRight and and for me please help me I Want to try like gee I'd love\nAll right so um so the flush is not not working I mean it's not removing all the way so usually when the waste is not thoroughly removed it's because the amount of water\nThat is coming from the closet to the bowl is not coming with enough or a velocity right there's not enough of it that's number one the other thing is\nThe the bent pipe set you checked up top actually kind of come into a bowl of the toilet too\nThe water and air man and sometimes that little van becomes um calcified amend narrowed opening so you don't get enough fair to make it happen so ah let's work on the vacuum first [noise] um\nAnd and you know so we got a fifty fifty shot hear Teri ... a bottle of C L are\nAnd that I get back here than a burden on the phone I have a bird same thought man makes all kinds of\nNoise you hear the bird's name [laughter] hide fly directly I played overcrowded happening here oh my gosh he's an old friend he's an old friend and say okay what the name of the product\nIs called C.
