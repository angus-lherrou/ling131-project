thought it was time for a quick check in with our friends at the CDC Dr Gary brunette is branch chief of the travelers health branch under the division of global migration and quarantine with the CDC and he's joining us now from Atlanta\nWell Gary well with a title that clearly you're exactly the person we want to talk to on the topic of traveling potential room was how are you into that\nVery well well I Hope I and then that took place at the thank you very much\nWe appreciate it that's all right so last month there was at least one flight where some passengers complained of sore throats and other flu like symptoms and the CDC was asked to investigate so I'm going to start off with traveling in the flu since October is the official start of the flu season what are some top tempt you recommend for travel during this time of year\nWell that's a good subject to stocked with because he really all getting into the season now and I think it's really important that people up to date with with a few short I think it's the most important thing that you can do to prevent um for the line of defense\nAnd so we would encourage anyone to to get a vaccination\nOkay Gary either question I picked up a friend from Newark airport in New Jersey just a few days ago was this week and while I was waiting for her I saw several travelers coming off a slight with those papers face masks and I'm curious I Know there was a potential measles warning issued actually at Newark a few weeks ago\nI Travers are concerned about avoiding airborne germs do those papers face masks actually help\nWell it's actually that they took all within within the effective or not I think some people just feel more reassured using right although people are concerned about getting illnesses are catching a gun on an airplane it's a relatively\nHarmless environment although it is possible what people were killed people if they are ill they shouldn't be traveling we we advise people not only for their own sake but for a lot of travelling to avoid travel if they all\nSay are now and they have to travel maybe they should be safe please please people I'm All right so yeah so I think a lot of confusion about the ... it's almost like sometimes when it's really in the media that everyone thinks it's all over the place and now it's really not in the media but\nYou know it's still around right so can you give us the latest update on the ... is it active anywhere\nSo early on in the last year we had a lot of reports in the media thought because she would if it was introduced to the with it but we haven't been hearing as much about it recently but you make an important point because\nHe is still very much present it is present in a lot of the destinations that people traveled to pull the holidays\nAnd people need to be aware of the associated with the average person it's not really a concern but the thing is we know there are complications in and help through associated with pregnant women getting the disease right or\nGood information certainly and so I'm going to ask you this five months ago our oldest son traveled the gun or with a college friend and\nWe knew certain vaccines would be required but we didn't know what was the timeframe for getting them and there was one in particular have and I can think of for yellow fever then he had to get before he could actually get a visa to can you address the importance of meeting with a travel medical advisor and how far in advance do you recommend personally during this before in trouble\nYou know I think it's an essential to take before traveling overseas and ready to any did\nWe did see a provider about four to six weeks ahead of time\nAnd that's important because some of the nation more than one short and so you want to do that you have time to get all the vaccinations that you might um one point to remember with vaccines that this is a good opportunity to make sure\nYou up today with your teen vaccines your routine childhood vaccines\nAnd then we add to that the vaccine\nAnd then as you mentioned the destination a specific vaccines that might be required and sit in Africa yellow fever is one of those yeah that was provided a well ahead of time you should be able to put up with the ... vaccination Flora\nGary less than we do appreciate the chicken good information and helpful information for the audience out

three minutes after the top of the area you're at home with Gary solving hey we've got a kick out of the dark\nThat's right we're going to talk about a household lighting and wow what a change there's been an asshole lighting over the last Twenty years in it so you're like me you're probably a little bit confused\nOn what type of light and you use in our home even if it's L. E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened out we have carbon pest story he's with GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that was scary Sullivan\nHey good morning Gary how are you doing fantastic how about\nYou I'm doing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years [noise]\nAh I guess we have we add incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and a lot of people I guess just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so\nCan you can you kinda just talk about an overview of lighting in general ... kind of dig deeper\n[noise] [noise] well it's a great time to be talking about lighting October is energy action month\nConverting incandescent are halogen to Eli day is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting shorter and I tried getting longer\nWho really has changed with almost come full circle Gary in terms of like bald performance and we had CFL we can have an energy savings\nAnd long life a candidate sacrifice that\nLike quality or that slow warm up or that flickering\nElliott is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent ... in terms of the bright light dental comes on instantly with great color without having to sacrifice his other things that we had with CFL and get the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you the lighting is super energy efficient as\nIt is if you look at a sixty watt incandescent bulb now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm Mm LAT\nExcusing eighty five percent less energy take the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty one lightbulb mhm using less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty watts so it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than a traditional incandescent off\nNo when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got one or two ... made the entire switch\nI get in there and I see flood lights they see you know what is um you know like a sixty ... old fashioned bowl and I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli ... correct\n[noise] there is like with anything in a home improvement store or had a mass merchandising store or there is differences in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality because you're looking at LA de la ... brightness\nThey don't want to necessarily at the water's edge because really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what all is looming right does sixty wipe all this going to produce about a hundred women in the first you want to look for is I bought that has around ... author lumens\nThe fact that you might want to look for his life so there's different tiers of LA days okay some last ten thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which would be at three hours per day is scary to quibble aunt or having that bought last for Thirteen Years he could do something different on your Sunday Morning instead of\nJust like all like the last movie I ... it was like thirty thousand\nHours yeah isn't that amazing Adams fantastic direct that's perfect for me [laughter]\nThen the third thing the thing that LAT has kind of opened up for it says on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the software in light\nOf incandescent bulbs LA they can provide that but not everybody wants incandescent like light or maybe in different rooms if your house you want to create a different food or different effect mhm and that's the LAT has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now is vintage lighting\nLoan yeah dial where you see the like old ...\nExactly right from an efficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more electricity but not providing a whole lot of light and weeding out has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight glow mhm\nBut using a fraction of the electricity so you're using five watts instead\nOf terms he was perfect persona and you're getting along life for this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent ... also switch tally day and get those benefits\nJust taken everybody back from when they went to ...\nFor their first L. E. D. bulbs they were confused about lumens they were confused about energy savings they were confused about the lighting and then different people started talking to including me start talking about Kelvin units\nRight up to seven thousand the lights blue and super bright and I made a mistake myself buying the wrong brightness of ball but\nThe reason I wanted to have young Carmen is genie lighting his finally got it together in terms of changing the whole lighting industry back to where it was where you've got\nYou didn't know that the mood or the light of that ball which is you know like a softer why the bedroom like you made it simple and I love it [laughter]\n[noise] well for most people spending our thinking about lighting is not what they want to spend their time on\nComing a PHD in life ... not really where they want to spend their time or energy or effort is only done it for basically simplify it now we've talked with consumers we know that people use light differently in different rooms\nOf their home well so now that there's a lot of numbers and things on the package that frankly get pretty confusing so it could provide that down\nTo three different types of light bears relax which is a more warm comfortable type of light similar to incandescent you might want to use and\nA bedroom our family room ... kind of want to unwind okay there's refresh which is a more vibrant more like daylight\nHi how are you just fine\nGrained I'm calling is really what the machine that practically hand yes a bad thing to do\nAnd it's so hot and then turn it off if you want to do is south on it and I might\nAdd a little bit probably in three minutes white and all of that right now huh it get off of that\nSo just regular table salt and a a ...\nCat regular K O L O lantern I won't say what that is that when I shop with bad\nExcellent Victoria thank you\nYou're welcome and I have always a pleasure to show\nThey have very much call anytime soon ... by by by All right there you go I knew somebody I Know I I don't know about pressing machines but Victoria did and she knew how to clean them so I thought you do everything you know sir I Do not know everything John welcome [laughter]\nGood morning I was just turning radio station I heard your show thank you [noise] ah I had a lot of like ask comment or question about a light up [noise] I make eight flights that reflect\nThe light out of work that are out of ... out there may be directional lying for showcases yes why couldn't they make a reading light\nThat reflects light downward so where you can read I use the they'll condemn the flights like one of the the ... oh [noise] oh I'm Seventy one so I think I Need more light up my eyes are okay but [noise] you can get a good reading like\nI'll tell you what when you when you listen to Carmen and he was talking about different lighting John\nOn the back end of the park and the manager of the Congress OK\nI'm One of the things that I I Do is from personal experience All right so I too was always in search of a good reading light and I'm\nA CFLs are horrible for reading a incandescents yes they're not bad uh especially the old soft white were good\nWhen he talks about the LAPD he talked about three different types of lighting and you can get really involved in nearby even talking about the brightness of the light is its measurement is cola Kelvin unit the higher the\nKelvin unit the brighter increased for the light is so in the scales from one to seven thousand so if you had a light that was saved five thousand or six thousand Kelvin units it would be a really white almost bluish white Chris ... lite\nWhich is excellent for reading G. E. rather than getting into this whole Kelvin units because nobody's going to do the research to really\nLearn what I just talked about it they got different categories of lighting from relax to it's called relax refresh\nIn reveal and the reveal is the one you're looking for in that is a higher Kelvin unit light it is it is it is super Christ and it's for real close work or reading\nBut doesn't reflect light doesn't reflect light or to reach the end like into a regular lamp and a light goes up through the shape to the to the sailing [noise] well I always look for like it was like eating lamport reflects stuff like the actual writing about only down work\nI I don't think it reflects light downward but this light is brilliant it's brilliant light I I I Would encourage you to give it a try I don't know what that reflects downward I Know the latest\nThey could take the reverse aging lap mhm every direction you know to to the area and they put a coating on top to wherever reflect the light\nI remember the old fashioned incandescent it had a little silver kept to it [noise]\nIt reflected them but I have not seen one in in L. E. D. like that but again if you're searching and try and different lighting John I Would uh\nI Would encourage you to find a GE reveal I think you'll find it a really critical light and a do it doesn't reflect down I think it's going to be a brilliant in terms of being able to uh see the details and help you with reading so that would be the tip that I Would offer you\nWrite from there we go to Alex Alex welcome\nHome care with every morning all the way to a Sunday Morning on the way to church and I really appreciate your ah your editor\nThank you [noise]\nUm [noise] in the bathroom or one of our bathrooms which drains extremely slowly we've tried everything from power a Korean cleanser to to run in a small snake ...\nSomebody suggested the other day that the bet by ...\nIt could be described how it's draining is it just real\nSlow does a ... do you hear it in another drain\nThat's the second phone call we lost by cell phones a day so it can be if it's a clogged a\nBent pipe usually you will hear it um gurgling another drained if it's a shower during my ear the bath tub a drain gr grow a little bit uh certainly if you rent a snake down there that's you know and you didn't cleared up with the snake or I don't know that it would really be the trap\nOf four dreams that are just really super slow running I'm recommending a product called rainbow which has the silliest active bacteria and it literally eat its way through the bacterial blocking of of a dream it's also great maintenance cleaner it's called\nDrained boat but slow running drains\nAnd if you can hear sucking air out of another drain in that room or in that area\nIt very well could be a a a clogged event in worth checking that out run the snake down the vent and while you're on the roof\nHey don't forget about the gutter brush just as the time of year details gutters clean and free flowing as we head into the winter months and then the gutter brush is the ticket or Eighteen Inches three foot length snow cutting you slide just bottle brushed type apparatus in the gutter deer O L friendly than an hour\nAnd a ... gunner protects lease from clogging up the gutter thing keeps the water flowing nicely through the gutter their website you can order read on line is gutter brush\nDot com you're called next will continue\nAt home with Jerry [noise]\nTo get your hands dirty with Garry McCarthy one eight hundred to three talk your at home with Gary [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI'll never forget it October two thousand three I'm sitting in a doctor's office with a ... look on my face when they announced to me you have blood sugar count will over three hundred\nYou are a diabetic not only that high blood pressure cholesterol out of whack I was a mess\nThis is Kelly Masha Ma next several years were all about trying to get that under control diet exercise all those ... and it wasn't getting any better I sold into this defeated attitude where every year things we are getting worse I was getting more medication I just figure there's no way I can win\nUntil I met the people at the health there they taught me how my body rejuvenated self every Ninety Days so when Ninety Days you can change your body if you're doing the right things\nThey taught me how to do those things I'm off my blood pressure medication my high cholesterol medication and off my type two diabetes medication you can save your life and make it better than you could ever imagine\nCall age seven seven I dare me or go to our dear Columbia dot com that's our dear Columbia dot com for their health their\nYes exactly and and I'm telling you these things are great they put the light out where you need it I'm Seventy two ... and my wife sixty eight and a wave vote\nComplained when they started to come out with these ladies and some friends went by him and say hey you know and didn't work for me you want to try and so I had a chance to try\nSeveral that I didn't have to pay for mhm and I couldn't find one Z.

I got I'm On a Nineteen twenties like how can\nA suburb of Cincinnati that God I'm an existing flat roof I\nMean I haven't replaced but now I'm I'm questioning how to put a railing backup on top of the roof ... um I prefer to do it that way that things to be the least expensive way it is it recommend a bowl how would you recommend mounting the pose for your thoughts\nOn the way I don't know that's a challenge isn't it I don't know if I'm qualified even the answer that careers because when you got a flat roof any puncture as a potential problem do you know what kind of flat roof you got on there did you put\nDown here yet it that modified Benjamin okay the north but to me yeah okay okay yeah ah I'll be honest\n'cause I I don't even want to take a stab at it I Would\nHave to do a little research myself on that one I don't know if I got an answer right away even to a point where talking to a a a flat roof is similar to the person that would installed that what what kind of options have you received a disappoint you said you had a couple of options and one was a little less expensive\nUm [noise] well it it just depends on the the the quality of the room for that you ask 'em and then you have a handyman they're like yeah we can put it right on top of that we can you know ... and then just call call the way around it but everything I've read on the Internet shows that eventually\nSo how do you really should fail it OK keep going [laughter] on\nThe other the others are you can do it it just has to go in under the under lame and and then um there's ways to make the host\nUm have I have a thing that goes around them obviously that's a Butte are well you know like a boot exactly that they keep the water from in trading um and then the others are floating deck you could do a floating docks structure on sitting basically on top of the\nOkay let me or that one I'm familiar with the first to 'em and and I yeah\nSo when you first asked me and said I'm not an expert in doing it in the first thing I was thinking was your first option and that is where you puncture at UCLA there is a modified roofing cement that will seal that but anything\nLike that will fail I mean it might give you ten years maybe Fifteen a but it'll fail a eventually in so you know if you stay on\nTop of it that's fine but it's going to eventually fail the boot I'm I Am familiar with that

[laughter] very very I I don't know if I've ever seen it\nAnd that is that the paint was bad\nI'm sure it happens but every paint manufacture every paint batches May Day keeps samples over to test it in case of consumer has problems with the with the Asian and they go back on a paint company and the bank company will say usually your preparation or there's moisture involve or whatever the problem is and\nI guess if it comes to push comes to shove they test the batch that they have on file and\nYou know like I said I don't think I ran into where the paint was bad\nIt was always the applicators and it was always the preparation or there was water getting behind the substrate a but if you do the preparation and you can just about paying anything\nAlright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nTo and Gary yes or find some kind of on TALK\nGot a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub\nAnd putting a shower stall and its place and um and all the plumbing ... is in right now and when I cook the I'm a shower up to the rock climbing I'm using a suit chief I'm a brass are drained a familiar with those\nTell me what's his name is again this is so cheap that the breath I'm a drain that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass type\nUh you know this is this is a straight and the PVC comes up\nOn all okay into it and he put that new frame washer and they're right any type it down\nOkay so it's like a compression fitting\nExactly and it's about an inch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there was a great big hole underneath that were the original Plame was put in for the tub\nAnd that's where all the mice were coming in [noise] and uh so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with the rough farming or going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it'll be you know buried in that box um and I can't afford to have a leak in there and and so\nThe PVC has been tested no leaks there that's all well lit up really nice my concern is that near frame washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neal praying gasket I should call it otherwise [noise] if I put some silicone seal on that gasket as well and then fly to down into the drain and it goes around the PVC and then a tight and then not on top of it [noise]\nUm ... when that silicone dried I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking [noise]\nUh 'cause if I get a week I'm never going to know I have a week because I Can't get it on the shower vase once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on does that make sense is that um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber arise\nIf it's rubber ISIS the black piece of rubber if it's frowned about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the [noise]\nThe drain it so he got their compression and it's supposed to you know basically compressed then um but the b._b._c. can move a little bit and I live in moves a little bit I'm I'm afraid it that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak and this is going to the water's just got to go down that box I built in actually run out\nTime is that the end of the world I mean can you is that a cesspool if that happened\nI got to tear the er at the color and eat them all on the tear the blanket open okay\n'cause it's kind of the shower it's kind of in the middle okay and I'm I'm a ... it\nWas like yeah take up the whole sharp pain or anything like that\nIf well like I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower out so it's a full size to ... at the bottom happened you got the top half when I when I put that path on and I call in those two together like manufacturers says I was supposed to [noise] I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSeeing them come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have\nA week and I was ... ... yeah right and then it might come back\nSo one of the problems I have with the silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nOkay\nI'm In I don't know I Would have to look into that if I put ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's it's it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an inch thick you know we are pre war sure that that's about an inch tall so it slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the time they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taking those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it sounds and you hit a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nI Know we don't want to do it but it probably not the end of the world is repair bullets you know not like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can you can repair it I'd be comfortable with the ... washer\nUm I don't think I Would use the silicone unless I was released certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the ... yeah and that will compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you a call and you know if it fails five years from now that's one thing if it fails a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of disappear\nI Would think the NEA pre more should be good for a while\nOkay I'll give it a shot [noise] All right John thanks\nGarry alone for taking my call you bet I'm ... from South bend lining up ... to put in our maintenance bounding huh [noise] and um it it will go and the author from the bathroom\n[noise] but when my ... uh directions hair and gas and a half a chair needs to be be turning sixty five and eighty five year around for the life of the product and that's just not going to happen [laughter]\nMaintenance building then that's probably the wrong projects I guess I guess we should get that get back\nYeah because it's gonna happen it's going to affect that it he says I don't know which do you have is it to connect do word has kind of like a tongue and it has the and he said there\nNow and he came our whole battle hold back at the ... whatever that\nArea well obviously there and he said that they put on there\nIs compromised and women you gets below sixty five degrees so if you're not going to have it that that's not something you want to use\n[noise] ... you know when you go to Florida and one or two like hardwood floor in your house\nUh-huh um do you have to keep stop at sixty five or about how we don't\nKnow okay no no\nHardwood floor and I I mean they're all kind of different there's all different kinds of it he says there's obviously a reason to manufacture does not want the issues\nAnd I dream temperatures because they know it's going to fail\nYeah okay ... ... pound Daniel I had another question All right we'll see what I'm writing or shall I call a advertisement uh-huh paint your house right ... yeah I never heard of you to talk about that\nYeah in fact we even had a gym for runners shield on back in the summertime\nUh but yeah um so it's not a paint it much much more than a paint and this is um\n[noise] it's got many benefits it's I'm very very durable it's much thicker than paint it also has some energy saving properties it's got a um it's got ceramic coding in it\nWhich bounce back you know solar heat game um\nThat's what go over a looming fighting perfect fighting about it was put on a fixed mhm [noise] but it you know nothing wrong with that rent paying that want\nOkay well again and how long ago was that\nProbably ... that's pretty good and money tied yeah that's pretty good [noise] so that's really sad that\nReally your option so aluminum siding whether you go with the rhino shield or you go with paint\n'em is is probably one of the best substrates to put a coating on because it's it's stable it's not absorbing moisture um it's like ... not going to crack it's absorbed moisture so it's very stable\nSo preparation again the key runners shield will do that the rhino shield is just heavier duty than a pain it's like I said it's a coating it has reflected properties\nIt's going to listen I mean that paint last really good so did you know I mean that's certainly an option for you or the rhino she'll be probably one and done\nI'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that are coming forgive Warren he is but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years um but die it's perfect for ... is perfect for aluminum or vinyl siding\nGreat okay I'll I'll be luck on that up than\nYeah getting won't care what it's going to be in your decision all tall towers are taking my call you're quite welcome Ellen thanks take care Bye bye yeah that has um [noise]\nWell I tell you what if you go even though I kept talking about the signing but even if you're a\nDuring the run or shield over would\nAgain it's it's a more flexible sicker coating than some of your paint so gr abilities there\nJim welcome I guess\nOr how the comment on the guy but the shower based or the child was uh-huh and I put a piece of hard work off underneath there\nOn a box you Bill uh-huh so um [noise] it doesn't change the water would have a league first of all make sure that the shower doesn't really have somebody wrote a bunch of water while he's on to their native ... bail it gets a fight and I agree and and then when he\nSo instead of being ... completely what would that a piece of artwork walk on the bottom or does grip\nAnd he's going to have to go under there to ship as gripping\nRight you'll see he'll see

I think that would just damaged the plastic I think you're right you know and that that would be a good solvent to remove with ... but not gonna work for a minute I'm\nThe only the only other thing I could think of and I hate to see go run and buy a bottle ten dollar increase of remover but you hear me talk about a political ... over it and and that's that's not going to hurt the plastic\nUm it's for it he's sort of I don't know if it's going to remove a pot see though\nYeah I'm\nNot really sure what on there because you know it was it's more or less like to choose a right\nAnd and I can't even though I had a huge that on another part of the helmet it it's hard for me to think that that got on there\nAnd weighing down because it's just the of that it is it's not liquid ... page\nYeah [noise] so did you use the glue or no\nYeah I did but unfortunately I I just can't recall it very well put it in America you know that that\nLittle tiny too but that clear glue that what it was\nYeah so they're so like a super glue right\nExactly yeah yeah\nSo that's I Know acrylic and there is a super glue remover\nUm but again I don't know what that's going to do that plastic shield you'd almost have to try it down at the bottom to see if it's going to do that shield\nI I think quite honestly I mean I don't know what kind of glue used but I Would bet that's\nIt because the ... of that is really really thin and runs and in fact some folks make a\nSign of acrylic that as a gel which is a lot more manageable um but there is a to eat of equal size as the super glue that is super glue remover\nAnd um you know that would be something I Would try uh did you say you tried the nature of alcohol\nTry rubbing alcohol\nAnd then I tried the good stuff and then I tried the hobbies\nAll that yeah and I thought that would cut it for sure I got not too much scary because okay it's it's it's it's you know it gets on usable now that it's right or anything I Do it is it's worth a shot OK\nOkay ships okay where am I going to get here talking\nAll right so if you have any de nature to alcohol in your house try that if you have any nail polish remover you can try that\nI tried that I forgot to

Wisconsin we go amber welcome\n[laughter] yes I Am married and I love your show um I have a\nProblem I have I have a minute and a heart transplant and rain recently moved to a trailer that would donate it\nAnd we got married and I'm about a month a year and we have a leak in the real and and pretty sure that there might be more on the Internet\nAnd not paying attention\nIn the insulation mhm\nI have ten dollar hit that lady I'm Wondering if you think that we're trying to remodel trailer with that and now it or what we should\nBut I think the first thing you need to do is you need to confirm whether there's black mold in there or dangerous molded doesn't have to be black a dangerous mold or\nNot um and you can do that to buy um\nInexpensively amber it's um it's a\nFive minute mold test kit you can get them it ace hardware it's almost like a pregnancy test kid it's a little plastic devices a swab\nAnd you don't have to swab the mold you can just swab around the tops of doors you some of the you know there's usually dust on door frames um swab that\nAnd inserts that\nInto um into this test kid is it'll tell you if it's dangerous mold or it's not dangerous moment if it's dangerous mold then you really got to consider\nWhether it's even worth remodeling that\nUm because that could\nBe not only just in the insulation that could be on the\nUm backs of the uh panels of the walls\nIn other words that trailer may not be able to hold has value to take care of that\nA particular you know the issue so the first thing I Would do amber is is test for mold and then kind of make the decision from there as far as the league you know whenever you have water introduced to a house\nAnd you have organic material there is a good change you mold and may not", "show_name": "At
