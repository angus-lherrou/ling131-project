R. E. C. A. L. ... dot com ... quality from start to finish\nIn the ... as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with a new fixture and you just use the existing wiring is already there yeah no additional wires yeah it was all everything else has wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minute a project and you turn off the break or by the way so\nCould probably pay a very good very good turnout to brag are literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm the has a nice little diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide and\nBlack white or black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely any download the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy\nProcess okay so seriously it is that easy is that I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Sylvia of old flood light you can just simply ...\nYes if you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire that played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd uh I went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really has a lot like the maximus flood light is easier to mail then a flood like you buy the big ... really is because of the quick ... am absolutely who really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's at your door\nSo I'm at work you get alert I'm In the office in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notified makes the sound or listen to the ad sewage whatever the notification\nYou have it vibrates or the noise what however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation\nIf you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar alarm that can be press\nSo if you don't know who this person is and they're not drop it off a package or maybe they're taking a pack each um you can take action\nAnd saluting yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for for downloading viewing later so\nSo if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter]\nYou can see if there's kids come into the house and see a lot ... usually not every child legs are products to [laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years to sell this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you were the only ones that have the ...\nAre usually cameras free standing or yeah so there's a\nThere'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the poor side does come in different um different styles and different finishes 'cause we trying to accommodate you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as a release the porch lights we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe and our customers palaces all the time they replaced their existing\nProduct with ours and how much happier they are with the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality of the cameras detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera [noise]\nIt's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera\nTo detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but\nBecause of our application and our software and the from where the products we actually use less resources so um we're not as resource um heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr a wife I said no it's not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know I just generally speaking we have a very good um customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals so am really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time I'm it's just it's again there's so many uh features in our app that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often [noise]\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of ... to ... yeah so it's\nA it's in a ball basically um both the the flow of light and the coach later the other a porch lights we put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed the product you want to aim that cameras or you get the optimal um field of view so you

my guest he is with maximus lighting and we've been talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates LED lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds before\nBefore what before you see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weeks in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or a FedEx or UPS drivers

how can we help me yes\nWell I heard a click on TALK ... ... what the camera uh-huh now what happens is that many perfectly comes out there and damages at or cover your head is that possible and cover it for the Clinton thing\nOh sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the camera it's very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you gotta walk up you got to get the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other a small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors but the blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question to die and you're thinking\nNot alarm goes off on your phone at how we're actually not a light off the wall thanks so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting at someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button no light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart in order to bring what you said a hundred and eighty two three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI uh I have a question we shoot the runaround will trigger heart\nYeah so I mean the um you know if if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet mean your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know used to look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any kind\nOf curious 'cause we are very true life you know our law turned off\nEvery ten minutes though they're turning around the house\nAnd go wandering if they are the way that the jets the sensitivity on it\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control of his own drink literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera\nAnd you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turn to a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once installed a product you can kinda tune you know which alerts you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've built all that features into the product in the up very cool and then\nSee that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to ...\nTwo five five she'll a welcome hello yes\nYou can pick up a pod cast angel again we we got that on our website scary solving online dot com but one of the questions I have for you is we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also and and they can did they have any video of this happening at all\nNow yeah going\nBeyond them ... and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though\nRight we're gonna we're going to one of the videos is to send them to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we ... we bolted onto the front of the video\nSo you would get the person coming up to the door and see them in the video before they they damaged let's keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually a just a a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what to their looks like a standard coach late with no to the cameras there unless you're really looking forward so that if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome ... were to catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nSecond follow up on that cancer profitability going online mental heavily on building a vehicle\nI watched the first of all the car insurance tying mile ...\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home intellect so which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I have at the first

Mehta fires underneath that it was about ... three thousand square feet on that floor ha ha and one hours analyzing shutting everything down isolated that he made a fires or they were using the equivalent\nOf a hundred and thirty three dollars a month well\nAnd my question we could go further into it if if you please but my real question is simple and easy is do you have to run the suckers twenty four seven because I'm a if you don't you know I can cut a fit\nTo a hundred dollars probably right there and then on my ... is a hungry\nYou're right right well that's great question a diminished fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even little tiny portable ones was misled\nI was told when I'm Out of the pest control company when it was done that it would have your house so playing you know ... than it is ... you know\nIt died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy assume\nYou know but um I was\nTold that the money saved from that and sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so one is running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr ... even in areas a lot from one side to the other you know how they said today humidifiers\nA ... is the the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher extra extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the Monday percentages I mean is it below fifty is above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but I'm a I've had some pushing and home and to this because ah aimed figures guy the humidity humidity is not one of my things but uh I think I've heard figures in the thirties or around forty you know\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern though is underneath the house a that was mode and every time we had the right to treat it\nRang wheel and it was probably run in Seventy percent them\nAnd and so once it was treated the um the humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally encapsulates the lemonade and all that water vapor\nWhile you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal\nRight right and I know exactly why ...\nJoined I really Eighteen negotiating if you work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those ... all the time basically\nYeah how could I possibly maybe once a month or run him for about three days\n[noise] uh I\nCan't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do just\nTotally locked down you know yeah I mean I have free all your van shipping closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little like weather station it's about the size of a book you can put that up in your bedroom\nOr your hallway or wherever you want and then the sense or you just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're going to watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is busier you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house and the home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know\nEighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOn its way too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah ... well I was told by another pass guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted a fifty percent in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and a weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows sure sure\nAnd then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden the humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive down to maybe I don't know forty five percent ...\nUnless I'm abusing your time or the pope hop it's a it's a um one and a half horse and that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right and I was told by pogo off or ...\nThat once the temperature of the water hits sixty five and below ...\nSchools added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nOr maybe I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense it's it's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why of the bumped going Jim we got to go\nBut monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you got to remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nGot to think it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside and you got a big cold front coming through Florence when it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate I'm at that point then monitor where your humanity level is\nAll right thanks so much for the call I appreciate your welcome to join

and we have Chris with us from mill think Chris welcome that almost Gary Sullivan\nWarning Gary how you doing I'm doing great how about you not too bad\nThere you go so you heard the stage kitchen cabinets I don't know around the handles probably most people's uh unless they're always using Vilsack you're probably gonna find that a black grimy oily substance around the handles of cabinets or even on the doors of kid myths and\nTell us a little bit about ... got a long history\nYeah scary most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm resulting second he was a master cabinet maker and her you know products of is fun creations and that's when most furniture polish and cleaner was developed\nAnd really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish it'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural lost her like you said especially when they're on the handle your gang you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors we get that build up and no shackled clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime or a combination of several things I guess ...\nExactly it's a combination that's from cooking oil from the oils in your hand on the Greece's you're cooking on and not all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have ... or you know using ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... or ... you know clean and polish almost up\nNow when you use the word polish I I Know people use different spray cleaners different spray wax is to give them a little luster but even that wax over time get soft and grimy correct\nRight you if you products ... over the years you get that build up where you can almost great but where you're from there yeah yeah no sec doesn't have any ... in fact most jak remove all that ... going up and clean right down to the finish show on your dining room table\nOr if you get a heat ring that white ... waxed built up someone such hot cat on there and I kind of military whack so since most Sacramento's wax built up it'll take that heat ring right off the dining room table watering knocked the coffee table\nAnd it will certainly have a lot of those calls in the next two months I guarantee you so ah so the ... there is no lack sitting there in yet it cleans what what's the secret sauce and then you can't tell me the secret but uh yeah I mean\nIt it's going to be something special ... of the silicone or no silk ...\nBuilt up as well right on your furniture and our our our furniture polish doesn't have any water in it it's pure cleaning and polishing ingredients and their trade secret ingredients in house formulated and allows our product to do what it does\nAnd so anything that would have bought laminate because lame Leah cabinets and stuff like that they get grimy to work on a\n... right my imminent painted cabinets um it's even good on your hardwood floors in laminate floors\nYou gotta you alluded directions on the bottle you haven't been diluted quarter cup a gallon of warm water and you'd be amazed by the ... that lists and the shine it leaves behind\nNow does it have to be deluded for the cabinets are just like the floors just for for just for the\nFloors or otherwise use it straight and I guess you just put a little bit on it or on a rag is\nYeah you just to actually be slightly dampen your towel and then at the mill sector the towel that activates the [noise] the cleaning agent in our products cleaning and polish at the same time you're even came to watch you know we had to hurricanes down south and ... or using candles that candle wax gets on the\nDining room table were any what surface Nosek room that came to

and polish shame she get the same performance as the original I'm an oil except for you have a nice Christmas ...\nWell you also ... also has I think the greatest stainless steel\nA cleaner and I don't know whether it just leaves just a little film on it but when I use it on my stainless steel refrigerator and I don't get the hand prints like I Do with regular cleaners it's almost protects it to a degree\nYes our stainless steel cleaner is so easy to use it to portable liquid it's not a ... you don't have to wipe the floor up from the over spray port on a cloth white the what the ... the stainless turn your tower run a dry hot and dry and when that comes becomes completely dry it'll even be become more fingerprint resistant\nYeah man if you've got a lot of kids in your house to the

is also good on a vinyl corrected cleansing conditions leather and even vinyl\nRight a lot of other furniture out\nThere and there's plenty there which is a combination of leather and vinyl it does an outstanding job on cleaning it polishing it in conditioning that weather and not only is it good on all the leather furniture in your home\nBut your leather [noise] excuse me or like our car seats mhm

they were also\nIt's also available in a drug mark they have our holiday or on marks and do it best all over the country where in all their warehouses\nSo uh it's world we live in I'm sure eventually to work its way out but uh\nYou know yes yes nothing nothing they can say about that [noise] All right against eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five a Janelle also posted the question on her Facebook page and it says hey Gary heard you talk about this someone about David's are holes\nIn a driveway from ... is the word it's when the surface of the concrete just pops up holes are about a quarter inch deep anywhere from two inches to four inches in diameter\nAnd um the product you use for that she wants to know what to use for that what you do is you will remove any of the residue from the spoiled area you would remove any dust from the spoiled area\nThen when then you would come back and you would wet that area down you use a hose you need to use the pressure washer you just want that hydrated\nAnd you wanted as clean as you can get it then the patching material is a quick creepy ... product is called vinyl\nConcrete patch or and Daniel I um I don't know if you're writing it back to them but we might want to do that to a violent is vinyl concrete patch or\nAnd that can be applied up to a half inch in thickness it's a powder you mix it with water\nAnd uh you let sit for about five minutes and it's a it's not a slurry it's a patch it's almost like butter in a tub at that point and you can use a trial you could use a wide taping knife and literally just go around\nAnd just move over those spoiled marks on the driveway\nOr the negative of that of course is no concrete matches one concrete from the neck so if you have a very gray concrete uh this might be a little lighter than that if you have your from the south and you've got a little reddish concrete this is a little more of the great side\nThan they do so tense if you've got a lot of it\nAnd of course there's also products that\nRe surface the entire surface of the concrete\nSo that might be something to but the name of the product is vital concrete Thatcher you can find it and most any hardware store or big box store\nOr write to again to get a question on board simply Dallas up at eight hundred eight two three eight to five five or the Facebook pages Gary solving public your way for the day and we've got all kinds of things to do now [laughter] you like in your job today [laughter]\nSo um yeah [laughter] well you can't say because it gets taken off the air [laughter] so uh Gary\nSo you could also go like Senator or a Facebook page carries self and public figure and a poster questionnaire and we can get that answered also given the number is eight hundred a two three eight to five five it sounds a little bumpy it's the first time we've tried it\nAnd so I wanted to give it a whirl and see if that's something to make our show a little bit easier\nTo handle for you as you a\nTravel around on the on the weekends I wanted to pass that along a again that ... going on that goes through Monday and uh we do have podcast on our website scary Sullivan online dot com or we're talking about the chimney and I hit a chimney\nBe bono yesterday and he has to misuse backed up all the way to Thanksgiving I think he kind of said close\nSo whenever we can kind of started warn you in August ... encourage you may be to do something in terms of getting the chimney inspected um that's really the best time to do it right now every chimneys sweep a that is worth his salt is busy\nAnd uh there's association if you're going to cause some of the new inspect your Jimmy it's a C. S. I. a certified chimneys sweep\nAnd a lot of cases are almost all those guys who have cameras where they can literally inspect the inside part of your cheer me if there's a problem they can show it to you and I think that's really important\nThat they're going to actually show it to you\nSo are there any way that something if if you didn't get your Jimmy inspected and I know you might have to wait a little bit but I Would definitely get on their list\nRight again ah well Mark's got a question mark welcome or a comment hello hey Gary how you doing today and good sir\nI just want to let you know I ordered that ... that are that great deal of mill sec\nYep should beer and a couple of days will forward to it is good stuff and I'm telling you what that products golly I was in\nA hardware business you know twenty five years ago and I'm telling you what that ... been around a hundred years\nYeah boy I bought some I bought them a couple of years ago and I liked it and so now I Need to do more so very good anyway you had a caller a moment ago talk about all these I O T devices Internet of things devices that can be an act\nAnd according to the IT professional though I work with a fellow says\nThat um what most people neglect to do and this is why the devices so ... is ... ... they forget to go in and change the default password on these devices and oftentimes that default passed where it might be a string of numbers like one two three four five six\nOh that's really easy to hack so you want to do\nWhether it's a baby monitor or it's this lighting system any of these Internet connected devices you know get into the instructions there and look for where the password Saturdays and go in and change the password come up with something\nUnique only rules about passwords right into combinations of letters and numbers your\nAnd character signs and and that should\nMake it more robust and and I guess the other thing you want to do too as well is is most of these\nCompanies will ask you if you want to be on an email mailing list right promotional announcements and so forth you might want to sign\nUp for that because they will send you products bullet should updates that say hey there's a there's a new from where upgrade for this you want to download this from where upgrade\nSo that you only get the best you know ... to production protection or whatever it happens to be for the device\nSo certainly a cat and mouse game right now and you put some clarity on there so I appreciate it mark no problem thank alright thank you to go\nHey we've been
