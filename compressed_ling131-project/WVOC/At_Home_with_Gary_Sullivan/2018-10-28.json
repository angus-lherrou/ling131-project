D. P. rubber a which is much more ... which is a stick on also and then there's some with frames that are more substantial with all vinyl bowl but in the ...\nAnd that's the direction I Would go also the joint between the frame and the exterior in the interior walls might take a look it may be putting some uh ... and they're the one thing I don't want you to do is don't concentrate on talking the bottom of that frame\nAnd a lot of cases if the openings or at the top or the sides and you know wind driven rain and water gets in being fined that frame a PC or clock the bottom that water can escape\nAnd then we hold that water in and that's why you see so many door frames that first a bottom twelve inches of the wood frame is just totally rotted\nThere's um obviously if you have an issue with it and the parts broke and\nUh you got to get the part and there's a lot of window parts companies out there and you can also look on line I mean they'll have six and seven million bart GS millions with an M but um at least you can still find parts for a lot of the western window up in the northern Ohio areas one\nAnd uh there's many throughout the country really but the meat that fell to show all the time tells me his infant Tori is in the seven million range so or\nTake pictures trade pictures in order them online um any gaps or flaws in the construction around the frame um can be cocked again always be careful of clocking any\nPiece of wood down at the base a lot of times you got to let that waters Cape and talking at the bottom really can cause bigger problems um weather stripping on some of the\nUm ventilator double hung windows can be replaced\nAgain knowing the type that knowing the configuration of the channel\nA will be key but those\nWeather stripping parts can be replaced\nAnd it is just like weather stripping a door and a lot of cases just sliding it in to the channels so those are a couple of things you really want to take a look at it before it gets too uh too cold out cleaning windows [laughter] I Know they just lost a lot of people that don't do windows but really cleaning windows\nOr extend the life of a window remember window glass is liquid\nYes it's a liquid you look at\nReally really old glass eighty Ninety a hundred years old you ever knows how it's wavy\nAnd it's a liquid but a glass um needs to be clean it can get a little pits in it I'm\nIn one of the best products for clean glass that I've come across is that jaws glass cleaner\nA J ws I Know kroger's carries it and a lot of parts of the country now you can also get it in on line at the jaws cleans dot com\nBut uh that I Would highly recommend that in fact it's a ph neutral there's no silver spoons or alcohol and that\nAnd what that means is you can use it on a glass like um high def TV screens\nComputer screens get even use it on your eyeglasses I'm the one of those things that are about yourself on screen cell phone screens another one that a lot of sensitivity you got to\nUse the ph neutral or civil no alcohol no silicon glass mayor I had a friend of mine asked me the other day said actually my TV screen but now I can see kinda little streets in it and I said\nWould you use\nThat issues in say a common brand of a window cleaner and ISIS got ammonia in it it's got alcohol in it it'll streak that find screen and they go well how to get rid of it you don't\nYou don't\nUh so ph neutral or products like the jaws cleaners um\nI Would highly recommend that glass cleaner you can also get it on Amazon meeting about that prior to it because of the spray bottle and um it's got cartridges so once you spray that onto\nThe glass and you do all these windows in your bottles half empty you\nDon't have to go out and buy another bottle you when it solve away empty can fill that up with water\nTake that cartridge and just put it in the neck of the bottle and run the spray or through it and it just versus um the concentrate in with the water and you've got another bottle you're you're ready to go so um you don't have to keep buying the bottle and all that saves on storage and everything else but [noise]\nJaws cleaners a check that out another tip on clean the windows and we're talking about the weather is ... and just kind of getting things all straightened up um is some paper towels not all some paper towels\nHave a little bit of wax and um\nSo if you're using a good product like a jaws where it's gonna be street free always use a micro fiber cloth I'd stay away from the paper towel some are great I'm not trying to just knocked\nPaper towels newspaper that works good to know no ... newspapers but a micro fiber clause that ph neutral product like jaws\nYou're not going to have any streak in a glass so then you've lubricate decide you replace the weather stripping and you clean the glass he did a really good job of uh uh getting those windows\nAre ready for winter and again just make sure they're locked when the weather gets cold enough have got old wood windows you may not realize this you can actually clock a window close so you know the old double hung wood windows when the wind blows you can actually hear rattle\nAnd um I think we've all lived in a house where that was the problem and if you still have those in your house or you can tighten those up there is a product called draft stop\nAnd what you get to clear ... that you can literally clock that ventilator closed can't open it in the middle of winter though\nA bus cost closing come march that little clear talking will simply a peel away but if new windows aren't a budget or maybe you're just you know bought an older home you're\nRefurbishing it you've caught those ventilators close take some clear plastic those when the kids in put those on the front I'm telling you can take a really old drafting inefficient window\nAnd you get yourself another year to where the life out of there and really minimize the draft are coming into your home so that's a couple of things if\nNot really encouraging you do that right now but [noise] come January that might be something you want to take a look cat if we ever really really cold winters just ... closed get plastic over it [noise] you know we'll worry about replacement windows on another day [noise] All right to our phone number you can join this eight hundred [noise] eight\nThree eight to five five

which is a neat little package mortar that can be applied to a vertical surfaces I'm you could also use a hydraulic\nA concrete patch little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really

week Israel fix some things up you have a house or probably a few things that are broken\nHave an older house you've probably got issues with plaster you probably got issues with wood is rotted so river friend Richard in from Abbott Tron which you know we're talking about all the time but the\nGot some good news Richard welcomed at home with Gary Sylvan\nHey Gary how you doing guys been busy habit you know ...\nOr ... or or a girl or a market\nAnd go rotting in and out is getting older you know what it will never stop it all up exactly\nLet's talk a little bit about what we had a call yesterday in fact and I recommend it to your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was a ... column I can't remember how old the house was whether there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rather than there were suddenly cocked underneath it so it was hold water and it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's already hear about all the ... or ... columns and whether there's our cars are under their how calm\nThere's a there's definitely where your style um and we took it from your products are ideal are making those repairs um where to start to bad or the ... um air rather than having her ... her entire column which ... years are\nHoxby products are called liquid would and where he talks a patch up those bases and it's a real simple process or any of your home or can can use these products\nI'm there to talk to you than in our liquid would product a is a penetrating pox he would heart where so\nWhere would start school go bad and it gets a rotted and hockey and soft right um would you do is you brush away the loose crumbling materials that that that would rock creates and then you want to saturate all that or anything with black or using that liquid with product\nAnd go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into those fibers and ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that soft material it ties it all back together\nUm and make some monolithic repair hardening all that would\nSo I'm so strong actually it's drones\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid would has a compressed those strengths rating over five thousand PSI so there's a vote bearing type repair product chair this isn't just a just a a a band aid that's going to last until you sell the house this is something that's going to last\nFor generations to come this isn't a you know just a quick uh a quick cover up ten product\nAnd then you'll take your ... moved out of the debt point\nYeah exactly so you want to saturate those rotted areas with that liquid would and then uh you actually apply or what a pox while that liquid would still wet\nTacky and sticky and the ... is another part of proxy but rather than be liquid this is more like a party or filler mhm and you use that to patch and replaced the missing sections of ...\nSo you can fill in and rebuild or anything that's missing and you can do barrel checks cracks and splits in the wood or you can rebuild entire\nYou know chunks of of missing material if you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope of or repair that you can make on something like that so\nYeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was in me whether there would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd I'm going well you know if you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went and explained kind of how the liquid would works in boy that is that's the tickets for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nOh right right yeah there's a lot of uh you know single component products on the market that uh like I said there there are ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're\nOr they're meant for interior used or something like that so [noise] you know when you're when you're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural unstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ... types or you\nKnow you folks in amateur on him good news about these products and no because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the white guy and it can really take care of some of these issues around their home\nAnd we were sending them the Amazon dot com or send the Amazon but now they can do to your local ... right\n[laughter] exactly ah we're we're pretty excited I'm Greta ... would have products products or\nHave just been added to the age distribution network and a\nA civil wars we're just trying to get the word out because a lot of the white customers um they don't necessarily understand that a lot of the a storms or an independent Leone hardware stores in pain stores um you know the the owners of those places are are looking to those customers to find out what\nType of products they need right now and now are liquid ... would have ... products are available through that age distribution of channel and so if you can't hide it at your local a store already\nA A R U ... asked your you know the the owner the paint the paint manager guy locally store and they can they can order those products right in that can uh they can get him on the shelf for yeah\nSure sure I'm great products and certainly make those projects that look a kind of overwhelming a obtainable and um you know as you just kind of walk them through this is a project most people can tackle in their home\nOh exactly yeah exactly are we simplified the products that are they're eager to years they're easy to mix there say to your the bell ah there's UCs are our guests are nasty chemicals involved with these products um and you don't you don't have to be a pro ... you just have to be able to follow through simple instructions and\nUh and anybody can can use and and create a successful repair\nSuper so that's called liquid wouldn't ... let me shift gears a little bit because of folks that have older homes and they have plaster walls there always challenged [laughter] I don't care what kind of house to live and they're always challenged with cracks in plaster usually\nBeen talking about are weatherization now that we have that up a Gary Sullivan online dot com and on Facebook public figure\nPeople are posting questions were answering um if you'd like to call we can go that route it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five grab a line and we're going to give us a call ... crazy\nToday is actually I'm a little testy to write an essay on her way in a fun way ... can't keep up with me today Mike welcome\nYes this is my family I'm from Alabama on one of three point nine AM thank you and the question I\nMy father in a while I'm a care I my son okay\nAnd he's eighty six years old and I live with him and he asked trouble [laughter] I'm open to clean up after yourself in\nAny way to lean real far over\nOwn taste calling me right now but I can tell when it when he landed over it takes\n... around the bottom on the base so Sylvia Earle on on the floor\nYeah so um what's going on there is a that toilet is not stabilized on the floor or is a little bit um war and so ... that toilet that sits\nAnd just to kind of give you a one on one on how that world as you've got a four inch pipe the sewer line that's coming up\nAnd you got a ... inch and you have a wax ring the wax ring then seals at the bottom of the toilet and too bold anchor the ... toilet down to the floor\nOr which goes through the uh little plans and secured what's happened is all the way it's been shifted under the front either those votes have become loose they've broken probably just became loose\nAnd that seal is become compromised so when we're flushing that that flush of the water in the toilet bowl\nIs since the toilet is not sealed to lose the a pipe properly you're getting a little spill out on the sides so what you need to do is you need to shut off the water you need to you're going to take that floor off the flinch\nI'm In a ... again you have to get a ... knife scrape off the wax ring and then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal it's a little bit easier to ah make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed in ... on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a ... case in rubber I'm In you'll tightened that up real good your ... on the floor of the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your problem\nAll right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that and the Charles welcome\nGarry Yes sir I got an interesting problem alright I had some holes\nIn my garage wall and then I got those patch just fine the problem is there's a finish on the wall strike it down with a like a quote unquote a plaster type that's kinda runny and rock\nOkay I'm Wondering how could I replicated back [laughter]\nMillion dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nBecause we all have our own kind of artistic touch do it so some people do um uh do use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others will have a\nHalf moon or half around type trial then we'll just wait a minute ... what do you mean by dripped\nUh it it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like it was just going to be when they put it on the walls\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping compound I Can't really visualize what the design would look like I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was the big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... the ... that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush a in literally do what you just said kind of drifted or whatever\nThinking yeah yeah I think it and there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people to try to imagine how that person put that on a big piece of cardboard\nAnd try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about but you know a dripping\nOr a a rain type a finished on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted a you know just maybe just a little bit sicker than paint and just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre mixing\nIt up yeah just use a regular um yeah pre mixed uh I caught up in Columbus and just mix more water and to get it more Ramy\n... show hey that sounds like ocean All right good luck tonight\nThank you take care Bye bye [noise] all\nWell we'll fix it up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred a two three eight to five five earlier in the show today somebody called

Joe ... everything's jailed for and that sticky\nSo like me I use a gel a shaving cream um shave in Washington dumped going down the drain but that gel even though it goes down the drain it starts slowly a coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe\nAnd that a gel combined with flaky skin some risk yours is a bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a\nLike a culture bacteria that creates enzymes that eats that bacteria [laughter] okay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the\nInside of our pipes okayed that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current piping you he uses a maintenance product gets called
