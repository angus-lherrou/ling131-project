Wang is and it wasn't self initiated this is something that just happened while I was recovery and then I ended up recovering very quickly\nUm and actually the same year I was back during doing workshops\nWow this is and then you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear earth or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you taste that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as cars science has been thought of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people\nHave they wake up in the middle of the night and there are no I'm all over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to be travels the experience to ... the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery\nOr twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're mad their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively\nFor instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind near\nOh the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise] but\nThat's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with their higher self with are

with pets to be generally jak here ... he's the founder of preservation specialists\nYou've seen pat and the local media you read his articles in USA Today and investors business daily he joins me today as we talk about whether you're getting good advice for going through this checklist to help you determine if you are getting good financial guidance this is so important\nAs you head into retirement one of the things you want to know is is the advice he gave her you're working with is required to put\nYour best interests ahead of their own self patch should we ask more from our financial professional\nThan upholding the fiduciary standard yes\nA and in fact I heard a speaker say many many moons ago Gen if someone is giving you bad advice there's only two possible answers it's because they don't know the right answer it where they don't care and he would always say well which one is better and the point being neither one is acceptable right [laughter]\nSo you need someone who cares which is the fiduciary standard because they're putting your interests first but then you also need somebody who knows it's my second item on the checklist is you need to determine if the financial professional who's providing you with a device\nHas the skill set in the know how to help guide you financially in the current phase of life you're in right now\nAnd if you're not retired yet into retirement and this is a topic that I Know we've discussed a little bit in the past I Would say early in my career Jen I I really wouldn't have realized how powerful and how important this was but this is something that I have conversations with clients about on a daily basis and it's not me bringing it up its people kind of saying\nThis is what's on their mind and the analogy I always use is\nThe overly simplistic one in our industry says there's two phases of your financial life there's accumulating while you're working and then there's\nTaking income in preserving when you're retired and I always say you know think of that accumulation phase just ... you know do you think of like a horse a racehorse or they put blinders on them that's the best thing to think of\nIf you're listening to this and you're far from retirement you're just trying to figure out how to put money or four one K. or whatever just set it up with your employer put blinders on and then just don't even pay attention to just work and say work and say that's the key but it's you can't do that until the day you retire like that doesn't work so there needs to be a third phase and that's the transition phase\nAnd this is what we're talking about is do you have someone to help guide you through and this is where I get lots and lots of questions everyday jet which is when do I start that transition is it based on how old I Am how far from retirement how much I've saved and accumulated\nA of course it's a mix of all those things and so this is that transition time that we think is incredibly powerful to help you make sure you're getting good advice to lead you into that retirement stage\nWell pat why skills inexperience should we look for in the person who's going to help us with this transition phase for retirement\nYeah I think there's a number of them that come to mind for me Gen ... what kind of walk through a few of those here uh one would be\nMost people when we're thinking of retirement planning the first thing that comes to their mind as their nest egg of their investments\nMost people don't have the benefit of being able to just retire on say Social Security or social screen of pensions so they're living off of a four one K. or some type of nesting\nSo that's where the again if you're a twenty five and putting your first dollar and you're four one K. hey that money's going to be sitting there hopefully for a long time when you're trying to get close to retirement you got a lot more eggs in those baskets that you need to protect\nSo you need more of a balance and so it's figuring out how do you balance that and the example I always uses a loss on your nest egg at sixty five is far far far more damaging that thirty five\nOne thing most will pick up on right away as well sure I don't have as much time to make it up but the other point I always make is you've got a lot more at risk right you might have saved two hundred fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million or more when you're about ready to retire as opposed to early in your life when there's usually a lot of the roads [laughter] on the account so that's the first one\nOf the next one is keep in mind I don't hardly meet anybody who's gonna retire off of one stream of income where you've got money coming from one place so we really want someone that can help construct a retirement income strategy and take these various income sources so you may have Social Security\nIf you're married there's two different sources their four one K. accounts investment portfolios maybe a pension or an annuity\nPiece all those together to make the most optimal income planned for you and then that ties into working with a CPA or\nWorking on your tax planning to help make sure that your minimizing taxes and then the last couple of areas would then be also kind of protecting yourself you know you want someone as well versed in the various types of insurance and retirement like Medicare supplements and long term care even life insurance ... one of the questions I get a lot as do I even need life insurance anymore\nAnd of course then you know the answer that is it depends on all kinds of actors and\nEveryone's situation is different and then the last piece is just it's a big transition going from accumulating the blinders on to retiring and so having someone helping you through that transition in understanding the different changes maneuvers\nDefault assumptions that I might think well there's these things might be best but\nWe always double check that to make sure right because sometimes things go according to plan and sometimes there's a big surprise Social Security is a great example that I've told you Jen that I've learned over the years that until we run the numbers\nI won't have any idea what the recommendations would be or advisory team just earlier this week and we were going to get Alice us and it just said something that none of us expected it\nYou know we're kind of numbers in financial geeks and we'll look and say oh wow that's really interesting you know I haven't seen that before but it's fun because we we're we're trying to do is obviously pull together the best thing for that particular person and then once you gather that information is about designing implementing a strategy that can next year goals ones that's flexible enough\nTo accommodate the adjustments they're going to happen\nLater in life and I've got a kind of phrase I like to use gym that I think summarizes his entire topic and what's really really important and if you're talking to anyone whether it's in a casual conversation or sitting down with a financial professional just keep in mind are you hearing about product before plan\nThat is the one thing you need to be very cautious of because if you come in and say hey I'm retiring next year and they said oh man I've got this great annuity it's going to be perfect for you well that's a big big time out that you want to put their okay because they don't know anything about you and they're assuming that they have one thing that's the best thing for everybody\nAnd so what you really need to do is watch for that and see if they're looking at your plan overall or if they've got kind of this one thing that they think is the best thing for everybody in so we always want to be careful of product before plan and you want to always have planned first so that\nSounds like it's one red flag someone who's really pushing a sale of a particular thing rather than pushing the process first any other red flags we need to be looking out for when trying to find the right advice giver\nYeah I you know a few that come to mind Gen we were talking earlier about being a fiduciary and Syria of course doesn't mean that that plan or isn't being compensated dumb way one of the things they would do is certainly be open about that if you just want to have transparency so you can have an honest conversation\nAnd understand what type of fees you're paying and how everyone is being compensated we like to talk about\nThe various ways that we can be compensated not only that but if we're helping manage any part of the nest egg how those investment companies being compensated because those are I think both extremely important and valuable for you know\nAnother one that's kind of a just a a broad generalization I Would say is just be careful of big promises\nIf someone's telling you that can make you a huge return with no risk you know I think we all have the the idea of you know being too good to be true\nIf something sounds too good to be true you always want to ask questions and understand that I always say there's no perfect investment there's no perfect plan there's pros and cons to everything and as a fiduciary what we're doing is you're planners were just trying to help you see both of those\nAnd then one other one that I thought of that I think is really important is you want to you before you hire somebody just whenever an idea what type of time is going to be available that you can expect the term that we always want to say to watch out for is what we call the quote unquote the hand off which is you know if there's an advisor who maybe owns the company or delete advisor\nAnd kind of walk you through the first meeting or the first two meetings and then you're handed off to you know a college in turn or something like that up for future means because they're off meeting new people\nAnd uh you know every advisory firm has their own process and we all have a limited number of hours you know and as you know I've got a wife and a three year old and a two year old so I Can't work eighty hours a week\nThe boss at the house was not happy with that and I wouldn't be either right so we only to find a balance\nAnd said well we talk about with new clients is if there's financial planning questions if there's investment advice that we're discussing that's going to be with your advisor if there are things that can be done like changing how much money you're taking on a monthly basis are changing a beneficiary we have team members\nThat actually are better at that than the advisers are anyway so it's kind of we have found a way to leverage that is to really have a great team\nTo help you kind of handle everything that you need to handle and really all this comes back to his that transparency of just understanding what you're getting yourself into and making sure that you're not having a misunderstanding with someone right from the beginning and again that's another thing that we always talk about the reason we offer\nThe meeting an absolutely no cost a new obligation to review your circumstances is to give you an opportunity to talk with\nA comprehensive retirement plan or to help get kind of meet them and get to know their personality and see if there's a fit there so to get started with that type of new costs new obligation review cause now at age ... three nine\nRetire and there are a lot of things that we've tried to look at when we try and put together that retirement review for you but we want to take a look at a review of where you stand in how close you already are goals\nWe want to look at how much risk you're taking more stress test your nest egg as you're transitioning getting closer to retirement and do you have an income plans set up if not we'll give you an idea what that was looked like\nOnce again that number's eight or three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show to get started that number once again it's a two or three nine retire\nPets to be is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally Zach alongside eight oh three nine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three is the number we have been going through this checklist of items we need to be clear about to help determine if we're getting the right financial advice\nFor our transition into retirement pat what's another thing for us to think about what's another item on your checklist\nThe next one that would mentioned is are you following a formal written strategy for retirement one that has a lot of thought put into it research understanding it's personalized to you and then also having the flexibility to adjust to changing or unforeseen circumstances and what I'm Talking about here is a real documents that actually has stepped in strategy\nAnd there something that you can pull off the shelf or pull up on your computer screen and this is kind of designed to be the compass right we know what your goals are\nAnd this is kind of helping make sure that you stay on that path and you know I've had this happen Jen where you know maybe if someone comes in starts working with us in their mid fifties one part of that plan is kind of the health care and insurance planning and that may be very low on their priority list when we get started\nWell maybe a few years later and maybe they have a parent or\nAnother family member that needs nursing care and suddenly that's on your mind and so you've got this peace of mind to know hey we've talked about that and we've got a plan in place that fits your circumstances and so that can be very helpful and then the other piece that I mentioned briefly there is we all know life changes so we have goals right now\nThey may be exactly the same as they were five or ten years ago where they might be ... miles and miles away and do all the different so\nHandling those curve balls that happened I was just meeting with a longtime client and he went in for a routine checkup a few months ago and they referred to a specialist and he ended up having to have open heart surgery and while that was a scary time for them we were actually meeting just a few days ago and they said you know thank God\nI we went in there because I might not be sitting here right now if we hadn't done that so there's big curve balls there that's affected their lifestyle it's affected you know medical expenses and things like that so making sure that we have a plan that has that ability to adjust of courses another valuable piece\nAnd having an actual written formal strategy is going to make a difference rather than just thinking about some of these things and having an idea of what you're going to do yeah you\nKnow I think for a few reasons Gen as we've seen this over the years one is life throws a curve balls at you and that can be personal family changes that can be the economy of the stock market\nYou know if the markets crash or you have major medical problems we all left her own devices we might panic reading and so by having a plan in a planner in place gives you someone to talk through that and make sure that you stay on track\nThe other thing that I found Jen is they're usually a couple of areas of the plan that are really important to someone when we're sitting down talking at that time and then there's often a couple of areas that are kind of on the back burner\nBut what people have told me is just knowing that they have someone else looking at that with them and they have something written and document it just gives some peace of mind so I think there's those\nKind of in measurable benefits but then you also have you know the specifics when you have an income strategy we believe wholeheartedly that you can usually squeeze more income out of your different sources by making the most of them by having a plan for how you're taking that income", "show_name": "Podcast Special", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "14"}
