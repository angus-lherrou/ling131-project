W. W. dot Carolina fresh forums dot com we would love to hear from you there you can find a link to all of our stores in our store hours we hope you have a right wing gardening and we'll talk to you next week [noise]\nBroadcasting from the one\nBefore you get caught up in the height sink your ears into some clarity Mark LeVine one news radio five sixty jealous\n\n... Fox News he said Donald Trump supporter suspected of sending a series of pipe bombs to a prominent Democrat a latent\nFingerprint from a package to California congresswoman Maxine Waters plus other DNA evidence help police identify says are say act that fifty six year old Florida resident accused of sending more than a dozen dangerous packages the former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other high profile Democrats\nShould I be maybe using a little bit less risk\nOr more risk on certain pools of money and I think it bodes well to think about this from a perspective of\nHow much risk should we take we should develop a bucket system that we've used over the years to determine how much money are we going to use now how much money are we going to use later and how much are we going to use latest are never and determining how much risk goes on those buckets is a determining factor on when we're going to need the money but\nHere's a simple way\nTo look at this and it's a by using the income allocation model that you and I talk about here on your game plan for retirement looking at hey if we have our income protected if we'd have a plan for our income in a written income plan we know that we can take care of\nThis pool of money and say this is going to provide the income we need and then whatever's leftover we can take some risk on that money depending on when we're going to use that in the future on that bucket program that I just talked about and then determine if it's important that we make big returns on that money\nUh then we want to take a little bit more risk on it but the key is is that we want to make sure we don't have too much risk that needs to be used as income especially anything that needs to be used in the near future for income or other particular spending neat\nAnd so that's the key Rick when will we use the money really helps us determine\nHow much if any risk we should expose those dollars to\n[noise] that's true if we look at it from a standpoint of when and how then we also evaluate\nWhich okay which money should we use from a income tax planning standpoint\nThan we have the separate buckets of money set up to provide us with\nThe income that would have needed a future point maybe if we're going to have some in Greece's and our needs are expenses may go up inflation they eat away at our dollars taxes may go up um we have might have some more medical expenses we get longer into the retirement timetable\nAnd so we take a look at those type of projected expenses and how they might act in the future and we make sure that those assets that are working for us for later or the latest in our retirement are accessible and liquid most\nOf all that they're going to be there with some type of a defensive mechanism that makes sure if markets do drop down and there is a lot of potential for some market volatility that we have those assets earmarked at a maybe a five ten or Fifteen Percent maximum drawdown\nWell market volatility certainly can be scary and a nerve and we've seen a little resurgence in that market volatility and Rick I Do know that\nPeople nervous especially nervous if we perhaps have too much exposed to risk not something that we really ...\nRealize if markets are going up it's only when you've said it before the tide goes out that we realize who doesn't have a bathing suit on or when the markets fall that we truly realize\nIf we're over exposed to risk depending on how nervous about those downturns we get now Rick you help your clients better understand this\nAn allocate their assets more appropriately through that\nReview and that three step planning process the retirement income and retirement planning strategy session\nYes the three step review is something that we've devised as a discovery process that we've used over the years here many years actually here in the coastal Carolina region and now in the middle ends up in Columbia for our retirement minded savers and spenders people that are getting ready to move into retirement\nIt looks at step one how our income taxes going to look in the future can we save some dollars from slipping through the cracks and stop that faucet from dripping and are adding up over years of retirement to a pretty big bill if we don't fix the leak so to speak and\nStop the money from going to Uncle Sam so step one is income tax review step to is from a income planning review standpoint do you have a plan now how has it been evaluated has it been set up in stages of your retirement and then step three is\nDistribution plant your\nRisk of the money that you have also\nDo we want to make sure that we have assets that are placed in buckets that may never be used\nFor perhaps are raw money and things like that in longer term investments that have much more volatility in them to get a potential reward that may be higher for future generations or maybe for ourselves if we live in to our nineties or as long as one hundred\nWell again this review process Rick it's something that you offer to listeners to this program and many have taken you up on\nThis valuable opportunity to sit down review and evaluate our investment portfolio our retirement dollars and tried to make sure that they are positioned appropriately and we're only taking risk where it is necessary\nI Know it's a very helpful process and one

out the tail here and then we can comment on this so\nThe bucket was full at the front door packed\nTo the brim it was overflowing in fact the candy\nFor big evening had been purchased with care and with all the best candy full size king size bars as the day weaned and desk grew into night the doorbell rang it was the first group of trick or treaters they were all dressed in spooky are cute costumes and they also all the plethora of delicious candy\nKnowing that the candy was premium candy I gave simple instructions just take one I wanted to be sure that I had enough to last night for all the trick or treaters who we are sure to show up one right after another after another and in big groups throughout the evening\nAs a night went on the doorbell continued to ring for a while then this dream turned into a trickle and then it stopped altogether I finally looked at the bowl of candy still almost overflowing and I knew it was over\nI had too much candy ... what's that going to do with it all I mean I like candy Rick but I don't like to over indulge I could have given out\nFor complimentary no obligation review of your game plan for retirement this three step\nReview could help

without worrying about your financial plan this is what we offer to the listeners call today for complimentary no obligation three step review to make a positive impact on your financial future the number to call his eight hundred for nine one six two two zero [noise]\nBack here on your game plan for retirement with postal financial planning group's founder\nAnd president Rick turkey if you have questions or concerns about your game plan for retirement if you like more information on anything you hear on the program or if you would like to a request your copy of that book income allocation pick up the phone and give a call now\nEight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero so Rick in the previous segment of the program we spoke a little bit about market volatility and how it can affect our retirement income we also told the\nScary story of too much candy on Halloween and how budgeting that bowl of Halloween candy is much like figuring out how to budget your retirement assets and we got another scary stories to tell here\nOnce upon a spine chilling time on all Hallows eve the candy was sitting by the front door there was an apple amount I had remembered my lesson from the previous Halloween and not splurged on king sized candy bars this\nTime I went for quantity over quality I had the bucket full of many bars of chocolate and small size treats as the trick or treaters began ringing a bell I was more liberal with the amount of candy I was handing out\nGrab a handful I said happily to the first group of costume visitors and the bell rang again and again and again and it happened\nIt was still early and then I and I had run out of candy already the larger groups still had not even made their way down the street\nI close my door but it did not stop ringing ding dong ding dong ding dong the bell kept ringing and bringing in raining was it real or was it in my head was I going mad I knew my fate had been sealed by my careless mistake I had given away too much candy to early\n... this is the ... obviously the analogy for the opposite side and unfortunately what is the reality for many retirees today who may on the day they retire feel very confident just as you did in in your story here that they have enough that they have an apple amount of money\nBut if we go through it too fast\nWe do risk running out too soon and unfortunately in retirement\nRick there is no turning out the lights and going to bed early\nYeah spending too much too early can deplete your dollars and leave you running out of retirement funds to early just given out too much Halloween candy it's hard to budget appropriately not knowing how many years are ahead and that's longevity planning\nThis is how we solve this problem of financial planning\nWe avoid the problem of living too long by making sure that we have a proper\nDole out rate of the candy or withdrawal rate from our assets\nAnd if we look at past records and past studies and and uh ideas as far as how much should we do allow that candy or how much should we withdraw from our retirement funds\nWe find that uh the four percent rule which we've talked about here on your game plan for retirement\nIs no longer valid four percent withdraw rate\nCould easily run out in our lifetimes especially if we're living longer and also if we have increased needs during our retirement for perhaps healthcare reasons or increases and inflation and taxes so we definitely have to avoid this problem giving out too much candy early\nBy making sure we have a proper income allocation plant how much do we allocate to ourselves over these years of retirement and at what rate so a a proper spend down rate\nIs important to have going into retirement and especially if you want to make sure you don't run out of candy too early\nWhere we understand the analogy here and again spooky scary stories to tell in retirement are analogy being that bucket of Halloween candy we want to avoid the scary tails we want the happily ever after\nA ending to our retirement story that's not typically the story ending for the Halloween tales uh and unfortunately for many who do not have that income allocation component of their retirement plan\nIt's not the way the story ends for them either and so we want to make sure that we've got that income plan that's what's going to allow us to avoid some of these mistakes that Rick you've made with your bucket of Halloween candy\nAgain ladies and gentlemen if you would like to sit down and structure that plan or review and evaluate the projections the assumptions the speculation that your current plan is based upon\nAnd see if you're comfortable relying on that through our retirement Rick turkey does make a very special opportunity available for that complimentary review that retirement planning strategy session and I do encourage you to take advantage to pick up the phone and give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nAnd ten copies of that book income allocation up to the first ten callers over the age of fifty so if your retirement minded or already retired would like to learn the strategy is proving to provide for greater chance of the financial success instability pick up the phone give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one\nSixty two twenty we have been talking a little bit about the market volatility we have seen as of late and also sharing some scary stories to tell\nOf retirement and Rick has been giving the analogy of that bucket of Halloween candy and how that's a pretty good comparison to your retirement nest egg ... we've got another scary stories to tell\nWho ate the Halloween candy hey Pete before we go into this story real quick I just had a flashback on when I was a child and when I used to go out for Halloween men to friends of mine went around to the neighborhood and we got to this one door and it really wasn't a there was no pumpkin in front no a Jack o lantern and\nAnd uh we rang the doorbell and somebody came to the door and they said\nI don't have any candy this year and we're like okay I'm a little strange and would you like to step in for a minute and ... we're a little bit cautious and it was a man and he was a widower\nAnd uh he brought us into his kitchen and he did have a Halloween candle at the kitchen table and he was gonna you know kind of tell us a little story and he told us the story about how it rained the night before and how it rained pennies from heaven\nAnd pennies from heaven had fallen in his backyard and he collected them and he had this pumpkin full of pennies\nAnd he gave us an opportunity to reach in and take out however many pennies that we wanted\nI just thought that was a great little story to tell I mean in today's world you'd be afraid to go in you know or have your children go into a house or you know with the with the door closed behind you but this man was a very good man and he told us a story about how these pennies had been dropped from heaven and\nUh and so I guess if we look at the moral of that story is is make sure we have plenty of pennies to be able to give out to the children when they come along too and they don't reach their hand in and take 'em all out right\nAbsolutely yeah or or or Rick that bowl of candy on the front porch a everybody\nIn vision that going the perfect way everybody is going to be honest and take just one but ah it has a a habit of not meeting our projections\nYeah so let's talk about who wait the candy have you ever felt prepared like really prepared perhaps overly confident in your preparation only to find out that you may not be as ready as you thought you were\nMaybe or preparing for the wrong thing maybe you were preparing in the wrong way well I remember one spooky example of when this happened to me\nIt all happened down a dark and dreary Halloween Night I was feeling good I was feeling ready big bags of candy had been purchased weeks ago long before the supplies ran low from last minute shoppers I had learned from my mistakes of the past I had learned the lessons of too much candy into little candy\nI had enough of the right kind of candy and more importantly I had stashed it all the way so that it would be ready for me to put out at the right time I got home she got on my costume and I started the rest of my preparations the pumpkins we're out the candles were ... I grabbed the biggest bowl we had an open the cupboard\nAnd whereas all my candy\nThe feeling careers and look forward to a rewarding retirement\nThey had an apple savings they were feeling confident Alan had a pension and they had saved about five hundred thousand dollars in retirement accounts Allen was two years younger than Debbie and in good health\nAnd had longevity in his genes that he was also in good health but both parents have passed away at much younger ages than Alan and because of this Allen chose a single life pension with a fifty percent survivor benefits as the years went by Alan and daddy lived fairly happily\nThey did many of the things that they had always dreamed they wouldn't retirement then after about Fifteen Years they noticed it concerning problem their nest egg had shrunk to less than half of what it had originally been when they retired\nAnd both of them had many more years they planned to live and do many more things together throughout retirement\nAll that did get put on hold however when Alan had a stroke\nHe was never the same again and his quality of life suffered greatly and so did Debbie Allen went from happy an active to completely dependent on Debbie Debbie went from carefree to caretaker\nShe also knew that she couldn't do it alone she did not have the strength nor the training she couldn't get Alan in and out of bed or his seat even she had to hire some help\nAnd this was not cheap as she explored those costs she also explores her options for covering them\nLuckily W examined Allen's life insurance policy she thought she remembered that they had discussed the cost of this protection which they both had thought was a little more than they really wanted to pay early on and retirement\nBut she thought and thought she remembered something about how the life insurance could change could mutate\nInto something different she remembered it could also be used to cover certain medical and health care needs and expenses in the case of long term care and it's W. reviewed the policy she discovered it could indeed be used to help cover the cost for caretakers that we're helping her with Alan\nAnd she did use it to cover a large part of those expensive as the years continued to go by however the nest egg slowed and its pace but it did continue to dwindle and then Alan passed away that he was horrified to realize she was losing almost half of her income along with the love of her spouse\nThe pension was dropped to half and she would be losing one of the streams of Social Security\nThen she received a call the balance of Alan's life insurance will be arriving in the form of a tax free check within the next week they'd be realized her retirement was reincarnated she could live again\nShe was still fat and by the loss of her spouse but she also had a life to live and now have the means to live it she had provided care for years and now was free to once again enjoy herself and I guess Rick of all of our tails this is the one that is kind of the\nHappily ever after as much as possible of any of these tales now I think that in general people are not aware that this is possible but we really need to examine our insurance coverage and make sure that it can protect us against multiple things and can in fact reincarnate and rejuvenating\nThe retirement for our family and our spouse in our loved ones if the worst case were to happen\nPete this is a a really good story it's a really great ending it is also a a exact reason why people should look at and evaluate their insurance coverage is to make sure they're taking full advantage of what the ability for these policies are\nAlso too you may want to reevaluate should they be updated or are there new forms of insurance that could possibly cover some of these things that you just explained Alan and Debbie experienced in their lifetimes in retirement\nBut it's a great example of why life insurance is often\nAnd not analyzed as a potential tool to be used for retirement planning share with you too quick ideas of what happened in this particular situation number one\nIf you'll remember Alan had a fifty percent survivor benefit on his pension so that meant Debbie last half of his income when he passed now that was something that needed to be replaced because that income was what they both lived on but the\nExpenses didn't go down that much when Alan passed away secondly will remember that\nThere was a benefit that was found in allens life insurance the Debbie was able to use for his long term care needs it may not be a long term care rider on a policy it could be a accelerated death benefit ride or perhaps if Alan had a stroke and the doctor said\nWow he's only got six months left to live Debbie could access his death benefit in his contract\nEven though it didn't have a long term care Ryder she also if this was permanent life insurance\nCould be able to take out cash value from that life insurance plan to help support her needs during the period of while Alan was alive\nBut there's certainly needs to be analyzed because in Debbie situation here she did still become beneficiary of a large amount of leftover dollars that weren't used for Allen's care with his long term care rider that help provide her mom needs to be able to replace that\nPercent loss and his pension and also the money that he had coming in from his Social Security so when we do complete financial planning we make sure that the foundation of our plan\nDoes involve some form of insurance or safety net in case some of these things some of these scary things happen\nThat happened in some of the stories that we talked about today\nPerhaps it's an insurance product that provides a guaranteed stream of income or replacement income\nThrough a product called annuity perhaps that includes some disability insurance for someone that's still in there working years perhaps that includes some life insurance benefits or long term care benefits through life insurance\nProducts that are offered\nBy the insurance industry for people today to protect against the long term care needs\nThis is part of the planning process\nAny kind of an income allocation plant or a plan throughout retirement is going to review your insurance\nYour investments your income needs your income taxes\nAnd also what risk could face you throughout retirement it's

Fox News ... developing story out of Pittsburgh this morning reports of an active shooter near the tree of life synagogue in that city squirrel hill neighborhood\nThat's a major problem and again and we were budgeting a hundred and Fifteen or a hundred and fourteen million dollars a year to fix that\nHowever the for and that's coming from the gas tax Fifteen months into the new gas tax law the special account has the balance of less than Twenty one million dollars and according to this the problem is\nThat the expected expected tax credits that was being claimed by South Carolina income tax payers is a lot more than they had expected anticipated and uh so now\nThis is as big as the Boston Harbor Tea Party ever thought about thinking about that for a second\nWhen we first heard about the tax roll out windows two ... two cents per gallon increase it by two cents every year and then you had the welcome to South Carolina two hundred and fifty dollar new residents tags the national happier here yes thank you for coming to our state there will be two hundred and fifty bucks thank you for passing go\nThen we had all the other ancillary things having to do with the increase in this tags and stuff like that\nI'm ... and also the sales tax on automobiles but there was an opportunity for us as South Carolina taxpayers to make sure that you keep your receipts on your gas\nAnd then at the end of the year you could compare those with Maine regular maintenance issues for your car and you could choose the larger of the two that's what I told everybody in my house save every gas receipt you got\nSave him\nI had to walk into the store to pop doesn't give me a receipt shut up and get forty feet out of the way walking for a receipt because at the end of the year I get to choose\nOh take two of the cars and they use the most gas or had the biggest maintenance issues for repairs that qualify and then I can get that as a tax deduction written right off the top of my state tax and look what happened south Carolinians who would have thought south Carolinians took that and I mean they grabbed it like a dog on a\nBone yep there they're going to town on let me make another idea for a ... or a prediction in the next gathering of state house officials uh-huh we will have a bill proposal that says it's illegal for gas tax pumps to print receipt\nJeff [laughter] illegal you'll have to walk years you'll have to walk and again that's probably another hurdle but we're going to if that's all they do cause I guarantee you they're going to ride it out they're going to make an adjustment you can't get that tax benefit anymore we've only got four more years of it or maybe three and a half more years of it right on its own expires\nBut look at how much more money they would lose by the time it gets to the interests of knowing they lack of ours and that will have to be adjusted\nHere's another interesting stats from the story the department of transportation says eighty percent\nOf our roads need to be re surfaced or rebuilt excuse me can you give me the percentage of our state highways and you're saying again what was it eighty percent of the state's forty two thousand miles of roads need to be re surface or rebuilt\nClearly the department of transportation and the people who oversee it that you're legislature have done a horrible job for the last Twenty years to allow it to haul this is what you call a state\nOf disrepair yes this is where we're at eighty percent are now need to be rebuilt or resurface unbelievable unless\nYou happen to live within like a quarter of a mile of your local state legislate tore there is a good chance you like me are riding around on roads that would really qualify for some kind of\nJeep commercial [laughter] now for your legislators up at those roads are smooth the babies but that's why we're expanding twenty six we got some high pollutant legislators over they're tired of getting bumped into bumped all the way home\nSo and in case you're wondering how this all plays out you mentioned the figure this is the actual figure three hundred point one million dollars is what the state will be short on what they had anticipated because of the south Carolinians who are and your words hanging on to those tax receipts for dear life that's\nGreat I'm so proud of my state this is the biggest tax rebellion rusty to pass or to be jumping for joy\nBut as we a drive to the bank to deposit our savings [noise]\nMake sure you know across the bridge can be you could be the car we should hold the lottery or one

W. B. C. [laughter]\nDo you have to come with Jonathan and Kelly the road to immortality will explain that coming up hello Kelly Nashville's a busy week is banned for our president and national politics in general are we started off the week\nYou know Trump started he's been on the road all this week making a campaign stops working hard for Republicans in the house in the Senate and then of course Wednesday came down and everything get kinda thrown up in the air so far as\nBuilding momentum for the for the midterm elections coming up and the Republicans have you believe the polls now as opposed to two weeks ago or a worse yet two months ago when the blue wave was coming Republicans now are closing in a lot of those races that no one saw coming so they say mhm but we will go to the Donald Trump most popular choice of the week\nWell the most popular tweet of the week um as far as I can tell is one uh well there's a there's a couple that are about tied\nAll levels of government and law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including during early voting cheat at your own peril violators will be subject to the maximum penalties both civil and criminal at one who's very popular\nPeople love the law and order a Trump I hear you were to get like a Donald Trump dial you'd want to get the law and order dolls that\nHad the dog get the whole collection because that will be one of the better ones of the collection um\nYou did announce this week he was a nationalist that was thrown around a good bit and then tied to white supremacists on most of your news channels\nO'Rourke is a total light weight compared to Ted Cruz and he comes nowhere near representing the values and desires of the people at the great state of Texas He won't be allowed to turn Texas into Venezuela\nTexas said that was the ...\nIt's the talk of Ted Cruz's do nickname Texas Ted is beautiful Ted\nIf Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together we could write up and agree to a new immigration laws in less than an hour a look at the needless pain and suffering that they are causing look at the horrors taking place at the border Chuck and Nancy call me\nIt has been um difficult to watch that many people knowing that their lives I'm sure are miserable but\nHow they're being manipulated or at least from my perspective that's my opinion being manipulated by far left groups in order to make that a campaign issue\nThe number one tweet of the week is just a little snide comment as always Facebook is just stated that they are setting up a system to purge themselves to fake news does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business [laughter]\nThat's the most popular tweet of elite [laughter]\nCNN who\nI give my opinion rebel in the fact that they received one of the infamous packages of this week that was addressed to John Brennan\nWho we know is on MSNBC or CNN took full advantage of that even broadcasting from the city sidewalk in New York City long after they were building had been cleared for people to be able to go back in\n... although you know I'm not going to say a whole lot more about that because it is a very sensitive issue obviously this guy or girl whoever group or single person or lunatics um and we've got more packages being delivered\nEven we record these on friday morning so we don't know what happened friday afternoon or evening or even early Saturday morning but we're up to this point we've just added Cory Booker and James Clapper to the list you also received what is now being reported\nI like it as bomb like packages because according to NBC News these can't explode so there's nothing in there that would make them explode there not actual bombs they're bomb what packages is the phrase they're using now\nI share the some of the pie cast the other day so it'd be redundant for pike asked listeners but they're still reminds me and this is this is a a ... of this is as Hillary Clinton would say concerning to me\nI remember an episode I Believe it to be rod Serling twilight zone where a man went home and someone had had field is home with snakes kind of like snakes on a plane they were everywhere\nAnd so he finds himself surrounded by the snakes we takes a fire poker or something and hits one of 'em in the beginning and the whole thing just busting the pieces it's mechanical mhm so then he just walking around his home pick it up these mechanical snakes and throwing them into a bucket or a trash can until they get to the last one\nIn a bidding mhm and I thought this you know we're still I Know that we have scrambled every law enforcement person available and the FBI and otherwise the beer to start tracking down to the person who's sending out these packages\nOpposed the bombs but this is not funny not in the least bit so few here uh say things that you think that we are mocking it I Am not in Kelly has not\nNo no ... and one of the interesting theories I mean obviously the original theory was that has to be coming from a nut job Republican or conservative\nMaybe a then it became it has to be coming from a left wing nut job because they're they're not bombs they they don't work so this is somebody who's trying to imply that the right wing is doing something maybe\nThen that the more recent uh analysis has said it's probably Russia it's doing it or some sort of third outside party trying to further divide the country possibly I Wonder if", "show_name": "Podcast Special", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "27"}
