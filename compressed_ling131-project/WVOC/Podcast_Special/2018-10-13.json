are making some of the most impactful and important decisions that are going to determine our ultimate success or failure or continued financial stability throughout retirement\nYes the we're looking at all these different areas that can affect us throughout our longevity period of retirement that could be a twenty to thirty year period so we want to make sure that were evaluating all of those different road blocks or perhaps opportunities\nAny ... any issues are opportunities that we need to address prior to retirement in that read so in that red zone could be\nSometime around seven years five years maybe even longer maybe even shorter just depending on how conservative you are and making sure that your plan follows through for the remainder of your life once you hit the retirement date that you've chosen\nThe retirement red zone the financial red zone the warning track the home stretch there's something about this last little bit of time before reaching a goal that it's uniquely Dane\nTourists and deserves some particular caution and time and attention and on this program we'll talk about some of those specific dangers that you'll face in the red zone that can be rail your retirement the biggest changes that you should be expecting\nAnd a strategic move that you should consider\nBoth pre and post retirement so as always don't go anywhere lots of important information coming your way but once again if you've got specific questions for\nYour individual situation that you would like to sit down and address with Rick turkey and the team at coastal financial planning group simply pick up the phone and give a call the eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero so Rick the number one thing that you wanted to address here that is an inherent danger and something that we absolutely\nNeed to evaluate during this retirement red zone is the amount of market risk we are taking\nYes Pete very common that we meet with people that are coming into the U.S because they're concerned about what they need to know\nAbout retirement as they're approaching that date of their retirement and one of the things that I see very commonly is that the risk has not been as Justin in their market risk and so\nWhere someone might tell me that their desired risk is on uh\nI like to use a bucket approach on a\nSafe and secure percentage a low to moderate percentage of risk and then also a moderate to high percentage of risk and they might tell us why I'd really like to have\nRight now fifty percent of my assets and safe and secure I Want to make sure that those assets are the assets that are going to take me through retirement and then I'll take risk with low to moderate risk and high risk on the rest of the assets and\nThen we do an analysis of their portfolio and we find that it's totally out of whack they're eighty Ninety percent in high risk in equities and their current source of the financial advice hasn't done any risk tolerance on them and ask them these ... important retirement planning questions\nAnd propose what the risks\nOf market risk could do to affect their retirement income plant\nBrick there's an old rule of thumb with in Wall Street that sort of is an indication of how much risk we should be taking and it's not exact it's not precise no rule of thumb is but it does give us kind of a starting point to consider this that rule of one hundred can you explain that\n... the wall street model would take your age and subtract it from one hundred and then whatever's left should be at in your equities okay the base of your\nRule of one hundred would be your age and that should be in bonds or a fixed income now we know that both of those are a problem number one that equities can go up and down and certainly you can get a better return over your retirement lifetime inequities but\nIf you're withdrawing out of those equities what do you do when it's a down market can you take 'em out no so\nYou have to go towards your fixed income investments and right now it's all over the financial news is to\nYou know the ten year treasuries going up bond yields are going up so what happens to bond yields\nAre what happens to bond values is as yields go up\nOn values go down if you want to cash in euro bonds you have to cash 'em in it at a discount so we can't\nCash the bonds and either so we have interest rate risk on that portion of our money what we need to do and what my proposal is is to use the income allocation model the income allocation model will tell us let's take our age\nAnd let flock that up and safe and secure and that guaranteed income stream let's make sure that that's going to provide what we need to live on and then let's take the remainder two buckets the low to moderate risk or a fixed income and then secondly the stock or equities\nPortion the moderate to high risk and let's make sure that if we're going to use any of that money in the near future five ten Fifteen Years that we're going to have that defensively manage but then there's going to be some leftover money after that if we can afford to take whatever risk we choose to take so it's a balance model\nBut we got a tweak that model it's not the old Wall Street bottle where we're only choosing between fixed income and\nEquities because fixed income right now is not the way that you want to invest for your safer money but the\nPoint being Rick that as\nWe get older that rule would indicate we do become more conservative with our money and for most people that's because at some point in time we're going to be using that money\nIn retirement so we don't want to risk a great deal of it right in that red zone period especially Rick as we near the time we're going to transition from putting money in to beginning to pull money out the return of our money sometimes it's even more important than the return on our money correct\nYes pie I've got a great example here I had a client come in the office this week for their annual review and we were talking about maybe taking a little bit more risk in the man's portion of their retirement assets in his IRA but we wanted to do it calculated because his wife said well wait a minute now\nWorth checking income out of that and we've heard you enough times at your workshops and your seminars and your college classes say we can't afford to take risk on money where withdrawing out of\nAnd I said yes you're absolutely right we do definitely want to do that and she said but I'm okay with my IRA 'cause we're not withdrawing any money out of that yet we're not at\nSeventy and a half I'm only sixty five my husband is at\nSeventy one so he's got his start drawing out that required minimum distribution now folks that's an income stream that's a withdraw out of a pool of money so she was okay with hers being at higher risk because she was going to take a withdrawal for another five years or so but\nShe didn't want him to be a higher risk or take any additional risk because she didn't want the chance of that money running out in either one of their lifetime so that's a good description of sequence of returns risk it's\nAlso a good description of that five years before you're going to use the money or as we're talking about today in the show the retirement red zone\nBut Rick this is also something that shows us the principle of dollar cost averaging and the advantages that it can produce in other words when we're contributing to an account when we're putting money in that is the place that we would often want to take the most risk if we're no longer contributing to account\nBut not yet using it maybe we take a moderate approach but when we begin using an account for income we don't want to take an awful lot of risk without account\nYes the rules change when you reach retirement and the red zone you're no longer an accumulation you are definitely in a very close to distribution point of your\nAssets that you save for retirement so you do not want to take risk with those assets as to any market downturn for any loss in value\nWell again that's why you want to address your market risk especially in that retirement red zone you want to understand how much risk\nYou are holding or exposing your assets to inherently in your retirement and investment accounts and Rick that's one of the big parts of your review process is a risk evaluation an assessment because oftentimes people are truly aware of the amount of risk taking correct\nYes see it as I said the most common mistake we see is not adjusting risk as we get close to that retirement red zone in our market based investment so that's part of our three step review\nStep one has a review of your income taxes and where we can maybe do some tax for planning we're going to talk about that a little bit on the show today secondly it's income planning making sure that you have an income plan that's realistic and the expectations are set fairly review and your\nSignificant other to make it through the rest of your life\nAnd then finally risk as far as market risk\nBut we're gonna take it a step further there's other risks other than market risk and we'll talk about some of those today so call us at one eight hundred for nine one six two two zero this morning get on the docket\nCome in and see us we'll spend about an hour and Fifteen minutes hour and a half together and we'll go over those three steps with you and find out where there might be a whole or two in the plan right now but hey we got time to fix it because right we're in that retirement red zone right now are leading into retirement\nBut again in that red zone the decisions that you make the choices their consequences the path that you set yourself in the structure of the plan that you are on are absolutely\nCritical and will determine your ultimate success or failure\nThroughout retirement that's why it deserves some specific time and attention here on the program and for you in your planning and Rick turkey does offer the opportunity for that complimentary review that retirement planning strategy session he does also make the book income allocation\nWell again if you'd like the individual review and evaluation to structure the income plan and help you identify where you may have market risk and or sequence of returns risk that could inherently jeopardize your retirement and your standard of living in financial security\nThan calling request that individual review with Rick jerky he will go through the strategy session and said detailed three steps review process to help you make sure that you have structured they plan to work to help you achieve those goals and objectives that you have\nYour vision of retirement pick up the phone and give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one sixty two twenty or you can request your copy of that important book income allocation\nIt does describe the problems with the status quo the way that most people are traditionally planning for retirement it identifies those issues that are leading to doubt and worry and concern and the reality of the possibility of running out of money\nAnd then describes the model the structure of the plan that can be\nImplemented to address those big holes in traditional planning income allocation is an essential retirement planning strategy guidebook you need to read this if you're in the red zone again Rick turkey makes it available all you need to do is pick up the phone and give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nThat's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nAnd if you'd call us today at a hundred and four and I'm One sixty two zero I'm also going to give you an opportunity to come in and join us for one of our upcoming labs sessions on the books were offering classes throughout October in Colombia and also in Charleston for\nIncome allocation so join us for a live presentation on what we talk about on air here if any of the topics today perk your interest eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nAs we enter that retirement red zone and we look at the largest lump sum that we may have ever saved for ourselves in our lifetime it may be easy to fool ourselves into thinking there is no longer a need for\nCertain types of insurance coverage could this be a potential catastrophic mistake we'll talk about that when we come back here on your game plan for retirement in just a moment [noise]\nA recent retirement focus study found that the number one fear of Americans in retirement is running out of money can you relate Rick jerky coastal financial planning group invites you to a free informative no obligation dinners seminar at Britain's grew in October visit retire soon Doug ...\nYou'll learn how to build a stronger foundation for your retirement income from the low countries voice of retirement planning advice for over forty years Rick turkey is extremely limited visit retire soon next vest retires Doug much [noise]\nBack here on your game plan former time it of course talking with Rick ... and ... and the low countries resource for commonsense approach to planning that unfortunately is far too uncommon in the financial world\nThat's why we are seeing the problems with the status quo in so many baby boomers retirees and pre retirees concerned if they have structured their plan correctly or if they may eventually face the inevitable and disastrous consequences of running out of money\nSomething we certainly want to plan to avoid but\nThe traditional means of planning does not address that concern and that's why we see it as\nSuch a high concerned but Rick turkey knows how to structure that plant and the book that he is making available on today's program goes a long way and describing those methods and models and the structure of the plan as well that book is income allocation if you would like to request your copy pick up the phone and give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nThat's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that we are talking about the problems that we will face in the red zone and the strategic planning moves that we need to consider\nOne of those Rick is the fact that a lot of times we can look at our lump sum that we've saved the amount of money that we've been able to accumulate the fact that we're no longer really going to have\nAn income that needs replacing we may be out of debt that we no longer have children that were supporting we might be able to fool ourselves or or at least reason and rationalize with ourselves that we no longer need life insurance do you see this as a common thinking and rationale for people\nAnd do you think that this might be a mistake he\nJust yesterday I had a couple come in and see me in the office and they both had just taken care of their parents in nursing home facilities and foot the bill so it was certainly a big expense that they had and it affected their retirement income savings also\nSo this gave them the last to live on in retirement and so they found themselves having to pump up their retirement savings again try and put in as much as they could but they weren't really sure if they were doing it in the right way\nThey had a concern individually about long term care that it may happen to either one of them\nAnd then what if we work as hard as we can to rebuild these assets and then one of us needs to take\nMoney out of that pool for unexpected healthcare needs so they had a lot of concerns going on there\nAnd then they said but we don't want to be insurance poor we have insurance right now in our homes our cars we've got disability insurance 'cause we're still working we just don't feel like life insurance is something that we should look at in retirement what do you think Rick and I said well what if we could combine the risk of\nWhat if one of you died early\nAnd it affected that pension survivor benefits or\nIt also affected their surviving spouse as to what was left for them to live off of and one of you died early in life insurance death benefit gave the survivor income tax free dollars yeah gosh this is in a situation\nShouldn't where you have a need for life insurance now but it could happen in the future right what does that also gave you double duty dollars and protected both of you now in the event that either one of you that had the life insurance policy on new went into a nursing home or in the long term care insurance\nOr Rick let's talk about that in just a moment because there are some additional\nVery valuable benefits with what you just mentioned there but even with out those benefits I think that\nRetirement can be a long time and that large lump sum they gave us confidence and saying we don't need life insurance when we turned sixty or sixty two we may spend that lump sum down over the next twenty twenty five years and therefore we might not have\nThe same confidence that eighty or eighty two were eighty five that our spouses going to continue to be okay and I think we focus too much on the cost and not the benefits that it's going to provide for our spouse\nWhen there is a payoff replenishing those retirement accounts so they can continue to spend with confidence and not only them but how much more confidence Rick what we have\nBeing able to spend and enjoy our time together knowing that by doing that spending we're not jeopardizing our spouses in our family's financial security how much more fulfilling would retirement truly be\nTruly absolutely much more fulfilling because you wouldn't have that risk facing you that once you're\nGone the one that you love the most is not being taken care of and that's certainly a big concern when people come in to see me in the office they say our biggest concern is is making sure that we take care of one another throughout our full retirement lights state so\nWe have to make sure that that's going to happen if we live long than it may be necessary to have life insurance step in and re infused some dollars into that asset pool\nCalled our retirement income savings that we want to laugh throughout the remainder of both of our lives right both of our lives in retirement so life insurance becomes\nA new asset class of its own that we can do some retirement income planning for and it's often times not looked at because of as you said Pete the cost\nLet's just look at it as transferring dollars from one source to another source and leveraging those dollars by creating tax free income for our survivors and here's one last thing if we never use it in our lifetime me and my wife\nThen guess what it's going to go on to our beneficiaries income tax free and if that helped me and my wife live more comfortably during our lives\nAnd we still get to leave a legacy who loses here no one bright\nAnd Rick you did mention these health care benefits or protections that can be included in that same type of life insurance and that same price that same costs so talk to us about that how are these\nAncillary additional benefits now able to be included into our insurance planning\n... what if I mentioned is that if you died in your sleep you would get your beneficiaries taken care of through a life insurance benefits\nIf you had to have in home healthcare nursing home assistance or perhaps assisted living that you could receive that benefit from a life insurance plan or long term care pay out\nNow I just I always had a problem with that I don't know I always felt that you know the old saying smart people learn from their own mistakes geniuses learn from the mistakes of others we don't have that time or luxury and retirement nor and the red zone and that's why we want to make sure to educate ourselves on these important choices decisions and option so if you'd like to request that book\nThe Medicare blueprint if you'd like to request the book income allocation if you'd like to sit down for a personal individual Social Security report and analysis\nOr to map out your income plan to show you how to incorporate Social Security and or pensions into your total plan to maximize the protection they'll provide for you and your standard of living in the asset\nBase that you have worked so hard for pick up the phone give Rick dark you call the eight hundred for nine one six two two zero eight hundred for nine one sixty two twenty foot break we'll be back with more with Rick turkey here on your game plan for retirement interest among [noise]\nA recent retirement folk who study found that the number one fear of Americans in retirement is running out of money can you relate Rick jerky coastal financial planning group invites you to a free informative new obligation dinners seminar at Britain's grill in October visit retire soon Dutch neck\nYou'll learn how to build a stronger foundation for your retirement income from the country's voice of retirement planning advice for over forty years Rick turkey is extremely limited visit retire soon dot net vets retires God much [noise]\nWe're back here on your game plan for retirement as always written turkey president and founder of coastal financial planning group our resource for this important information here on the program always covering different aspects\nOf your financial and retirement planning life and the decisions that you'll make those decisions by the way become even more crucial in the red zone the five to ten years leading up to retirement the\nFive to ten years immediately following retirement that's the discussion on today's program Rick we've covered a number of different aspects of that red zone and the decisions that will make and how they can affect us the market risk the sequence of returns risk the income planning the insurance coverage aspect those important\nPermanent decisions that will make with Social Security pensions Medicare and we've got a few final thoughts for folks as you are in the red zone that we need to make sure you've covered written the decision to charge up savings make those ketchup contributions tax planning income planning all are going to be things that we need to\nFocus some time and attention on yet charging up\nThe savings feet I had a clip all come in the other day and they said should we put money into this four O. one K. and I said do you have a Roth option and they said yes we do said well maybe we need to think about that because that has to do with tax planning consideration how are we going to spend on this money when are we going to spend this money down\nAnd at what point do we decided to take the bully taxable dollars in our IRA versus some less tax dollars and our Social Security as we talked about earlier or we spend down our non tax dollars which are also resource that we set up maybe in our raw fire race so\nIt's just critical that we look at if we got this money that we're going to pump up the retirement\nWith do we put it in\nA Ross do we put it in non qualified assets do we put it in our four one K. to get the match important to look at that because when it all wrapped up and we look at the retirement income plan which is the driver in your\nPlanning for retirement and takes you through the remainder of your life from as we talked about today the beginning of retirement in the prior years of the retirement red zone and those early critical years of the retirement red zone that first ten years of retirement and then beyond that income plan\nHas to spell out exactly what we're going to do during that time now\nDoes it always happen just like we use spell it out in our retirement income plan when we write it out today no it doesn't it's changing it's always changing so we do annual review to make sure that we're in on pace with what our plan is but these three areas\nPart of the final three areas we wanted to touch on today they all do deserve more time to think about so called us today at a hundred for nine one six two two zero will spend time with you in our three step review\nAnd cover all of these areas of how to make sure we save up enough in between now and our retirement date\nHow to make sure that we're giving it proper tax planning considerations\nAnd also let's develop a retirement income plan let's do it now let's do it before we retire\nAnd have a good game plan for retirement going into and throughout our retirement years call us at eight hundred for nine one sixty two zero we welcome your calls we look forward to talking to you this morning here at the coastal financial planning group one eight hundred for nine one six two two zero and thanks for your time today\nHey Rick just real quick before we wrap up here sometimes I think in those last few years people may come to the realization\nThat they've got a pretty large tax liability in those tax deferred accounts and sometimes we may not sometimes we may plan our retirement based off the lump sum and not think to include the tax liability either way\nSometimes it may boiled down to a choice between throwing extra dollars into the accounts or paying some extra taxes in that home stretch in the in the final few years do you think that it's kind of a case by case thing or is there a balance or is there one way or other that you would go more often than not\nWell I Would more than often than not always recommend the consideration overall conversion strategy paying some taxes now on those IRA dollars\nIn that early retirement red zone period of say your first ten years of retirement up until eight Seventy and a half when your arm do you start so it's a great opportunity to look at it as far as tax plan in consideration but it is on a case by case basis because some can and some can't\nSome will some won't in some want to and some don't so it's definitely a case by case basis as to whether or not you would want to pay some taxes on your IRA today versus paying taxes later on your hire a required minimum distributions\nOn this program we have been discussing the final ramp up to retirement and the first several years of retirement and how important the decisions are that you make during this time the red zone since most people have never done this before and only plan on doing it once these decisions may\nBe pretty difficult if we have not received some specific guidance and education and these decisions do impact the duration of our lifetime in our confidence level to spend\nTo do the things that we want to threw out retirement so let's make sure to give this the\nProper inappropriate time and attention in that red zone we need to understand these aspects that we've discussed on today's program\nRick turkey is willing to sit down with you and hope you identify how these different things may affect your plan or holes in your plan that had been left on address through that complimentary three step review\nAnd the retirement planning strategy sessions oh you need to do to take advantage of that is pick

trafficking weather report morning's news radio five six\n\n\nHours away from the oval office I'm Pam who sales Fox News President Trump is tweeting about the anticipated arrival of an American pastor who's flying home from Germany after nearly two years of tension in Turkey the president saying close\nAnd he's the only member of the African American community who starting to get attached to walk away mhm but now um let's see how does that play on CNN but but Cory sellers on the panel\nIs what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures of it is\nA car and waves which you can ... out laughing discontinued he wrote\nThe whole panel up with that All right so as if Donald Trump needs photo ops I'm John I'm going to be clear ... when he said he doesn't read is not talking about news and stuff like that obviously he's a businessman he knows how to read if he\nReads a lot you know you can read spreadsheets he was talking about novels but\nThe point that I Want it to really point out was that because he had to make it a racial thing why did he say\nWhy couldn't you said this is what happens when a man doesn't read why does it have to be a negro and ... and ... obviously you're not calling him a black man because that would have been two complimentary of ... you had to try to figure out a way to demean him right there which is so pity and below you let me give me ... let me give me ... words\nThere was a problem we have with Kanye West and the reason we have to keep talking about him is because the bastard either this platform there is no Harry Belafonte and Kanye West there is no uh individual who you look at a who upholds their platform and use that in in a quest for justice in Kanye West\nOkay a quest for justice that what what you see this is where we need a translator when Kanye West says a quest for justice in his opinion it means\nThat individuals have the opportunity to earn a living in a way that will be self sufficient\nRight that we all have that ability and opportunity when bakari sellers says it he says the entire African American community needs to be on welfare\nThan black folks aren't that train ... in the race on draft okay\nThey've had it with ... seriously I mean this is not the kind of a west of teeth out and you know for a college dropout album guy on ... this is not and what's funny to me to watch all of these white people behind Donald Trump\nClapping away at the name ... wasn't that long ago that Kanye West said that George W. Bush doesn't like black people care her ankle Katrina\nAnd el ... but now the ... because he put out an ad hats\nAnd he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model for the first thing is he's the ... of that of the Trump Administration is is ridiculous and loans highway seriously\nNo one can take you seriously you are just invoking all kinds of racial terms in a way to try to inflamed the situation but let's get back to what her point is and that\nWhite people AKA all people who think conservatively because there was also blacks in the room and Latino is in the room [laughter] you just didn't want to recognize that there was other people of other races and or sex is there was women in the room as well but\nWhite men clapped it the name of Kanye West in the in the oval office after ... said what he said why would they celebrate that it's because somebody has become aware of the truth\nThe truth shell set them free the only way they get really there's your enslaved by the Democratic party and she wants her slave back on the plantation if you want to use racial terms\nIt all the only way they can recognize the applause for ... is that he's become now a chess piece he's now going to be one of the chess pieces for the Republican Party and the celebrated icon chess piece it can't be these actually saying something that other people or will too and there will be more people becoming woke\nAnd it's not just con you a a who's a musician a Thursday I think also kid rock was in the oval office life ... does Donald Trump need photo ops with kid rock or Kanye West to help further him in any community no he does not\nThat we understand that in the black community conservative politics if not really taken hold nor do we expect that to happen anytime soon Donald Trump does pull better than any previous Republican uh I think in the history of of politics I think Donald Trump polls better in the black community than anyone previously\nIt's not because Kanye West it's because Donald Trump that's why Donald Trump is giving you a power in a message of empowerment and some people rabbit other people are repulsed by it you happen to be repulsed by it man\nMuch like it was celebrated that I'm a girlfriend Taylor Swift tweeted out\nThis week a lot of people outside of obviously the people on the panel the CNN this week a lot of people started taking a look at what ... was saying because he does have such a tremendous following and I believe that they are going to become finally woke or another step towards being woke because Donald Trump was right what the hell do you have to lose\nOn the uh Taylor Swift issue I Believe that same panel maybe it was a different panel but I definitely heard people on the left celebrating Taylor Swift I wait and her positioning and how great she uh you know she's using her platform to him to whatever it is that they think she's doing\nUm listen I'm not one of those people who feel like celebrities shouldn't give their political opinions I Believe Americans should give their political Iranians if they're inspired to do so no one should force it out of you but at the same time just because you're an athlete or just because you're a movie star or an author or whatever\nWhy would we diminish their opinion so ... opinion is is valid is Taylor Swift opinion\nThe difference here is no one's calling Taylor Swift anything derogatory\nWe're not we're not ... we're not mocking her celebrating her for being able to drive a voter registration and if she does that that's great ... ... more Americans in the process is problem we're always going to be a good thing I shouldn't even say probably it is a good thing the problem that I Would see is that if more Americans don't educate themselves as to what the parties really\nFor them but it's just very tragic I think it just sailors straight just\nHow dangerous it is and how things can happen so fast that you go to a call that you don't expect that the fifth or just the normal call and there's really no such thing as a normal color normal investigation and\nAlso ended up getting shot and then respond and all sorts of getting shot so far they asked us to come in since we have\nSo much experience and major crime and crime scene investigation our guys are very expanse than and trained we recall an athlete investigation so or ... or have been doing that we're we're glad to help them out for\nHelp that thought a lot when we've had the two thousand Fifteen to flood here\nClark that officers to help us out so it's kind of a mutual thing that we help each other out when they share if they're called and\nAsked me to come come help fending off people we we respond or just like when I asked them for how they responded\nWell that certainly has been money well spent for the taxpayers and Richland county for the CSI department and the the amount of technology in education trained personnel that you have available in your force is really a leader in the nation\nWe are I think a A R crime scene and not forensic lab is second to none and that the international a you know we have international accreditation there's that were the best and ah and we want to make sure to wear bass 'cause I think our citizens deserve that we always strive for excellence and everything that we do\nAnd so you know that forensic lab and a crime scene and our investigators yeah they're the best and I think that the credit the dam that we got called in to to do this you know major investigation is probably one of the most important investigation state for\nQuite some time and so you know for us lead it I think the credit that he's dead but it\nDoes I Know this was not an important question but it's just something that is I Wonder about you mentioned that it's a four hundred yard crime scene there in Florence\nI'm and I'm assuming then that that would actually cover other people's lawns ... are they not allowed to go back to their homes until this crime scene as there's been completely investigated\nWhile it's still an active crimes they know they're not a ... that we're stands now live past that everybody is on oh they are all very out they are home now we've we've been able to reduce the crime scene to just a small area now but that for a while people were not able to go back to the home\nYou know we had to process to make sure they were safe and had the evidence that we needed and the fact that it disrupted the whole community in more ways than one\nThank you for your time

[laughter] yeah they were just going nuts yeah the the media had a rough time with Donald Trump this week as with every week Donald Trump apologized\nTo the Brett Kavanaugh family yeah for the nature of the nation you know that's all of you yes I Am your president I'm about a year and a half so\nUm but let's talk about stuff that really mattered okay so I'm Donald Trump is\nClearly trying to get Republicans nominated and or excuse me elected at this late hour where what twenty five days away from the elections are also so he's going to Erie, Pennsylvania he's going all over the place trying to get people elected the blue wave is a common according to pollsters\nNow they've got it I haven't looked at it in the last five minutes or so but the last time and it literally changes by the hour or five thirty eight is the uh the polling firm and they say that it's like Seventy five percent chance that Democrats take back the house when I look at\nTheir map of the U.S good news is none of it's coming out of South Carolina\nWhen the question is oh one district one in that one is the only had\nFour yeah they decided public can be I was even more than that the last time I saw her she was fifty nine percent is okay I thought was going to be the final for her Katie Arrington we're talking about James Clapper is going to hang on to his seizure but they do have a one percent chance for the Republican against them\nBut there are some seats in Georgia but most of the blue wave if it's coming according to the pollsters is not coming anywhere out of the south ... except for like the Miami area that the southern Florida\nSo it's hard for us uh who live here and we live in the I'll call it the echo chamber of Republican politics to hear how anybody could think that Democrats are going to win because they're not going to win here\nThey are going to win in what will call purple states North Carolina's got some that are probably going to leave when they think so and so forth the only thing I can point out is that they also thought the same thing in twenty sixteen that Donald Trump's goose was cooked\n'em polling had him at Seventy one percent chance of losing Hillary Clinton on this date was Seventy one percent chance a and it was I think just around the same time that the tape was leaked from inside a Hollywood like he is so cooked there's no way he can do is write us off\nUm [noise] I Would say that\nAnd I know this is probably not very popular comment but I thought Trump was going to lose until the announcement was made by Khomeini that they were reopening the investigation\nInto Hillary Clinton I called several people and I said Donald Trump just won the presidency and they said he's not going to be able to come back and I said I'm telling you the fact that call me is opening up this investigation ... death for a second time is enough for a lot of Americans to think twice when they go into the the ... they don't like or to begin with\nHer likability is about a two\nSo no one likes her and now it's like [noise]\nEven the FBI doesn't know about her\nI don't think we're going to have that benefit going into this there's nothing that I see that as like some sort of Democrats scandal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Podcast Special", "city": "Columbia", "day": "13"}
