David Brancaccio so they're ready to size up this afternoon game along with a complete list in it as a full list of who sideline this week time now for Carole and an injury and in fact [noise]\nBecame Knoxville to get back on track in front of the home crowd this afternoon welcome to Carolina injury and in fact I'm Gary David joined by former game called captain David ... as a host Missouri today on the S. E. C. network David too big game so far\nAnd the this young season games against ranked teams game scene is must win especially the ... game talks had hoped to compete for the FCC's title and well in both of those games handily beat and which one of those games bugs you the most\nProbably Kentucky huh I don't like the way we lost to get a play in Georgia and you know everyone I don't think anyone that was really realistic thought we had a great chance of beating Georgia but we wanted to play better against them then we certainly did we didn't think it would be a route\nBut that one's a little bit explainable I guess yeah Kentucky's not you know Kentucky has got a stranglehold now on the on the east as far as er the second place team right now their time with Georgia and and the conference you know and they get a hold of him I think in a couple of weeks they play I'm In Lexington\nUm so you know we're going to find out a little more about them but certainly where we thought we were going to be and where we think we are in the pecking order in the east there's news is not so well\nI mean bizarre things would have to happen now for the game talks to have a chance to one of the east coast or do you have to conference losses already four games in but [noise] and three games into the SEC slate but you know you've got these you've lost of George Allen talking so\n[noise] yeah ... ... and you know nine wins last year you know was was what a lot of people thought was over achieving for that ball club\nAnd um they want some close games um but you know I think people expected a little bit more now we've got to figure out where we are going from here which is you know he likes to play it every game as the season um another big game today\nUm we've got to get back on the winning track and establish some things on off in San on defense\nMust shambles asking his oppressor early in the week um about the differences between say defensively in particular this team this year and the team that he had last year and he didn't really want to address that as I used these wants to focus on the TV's got in front of 'em right now and you get that I mean it's a coach that's what you got to do but\nUh the the the defense this past Saturday it was like a Jekyll and Hyde thing uh and maybe you can say second half Kentucky nurse a lead you know three touchdown lead and all that but whatever the case it was two very different games for the defense last week\nWhat what ... ... it was and I think uh you know I listened to him talk about the same thing that you you're a boat referencing now there's a fine line between playing a intensely and play into the whistle\nAnd then there's a the point after that where you're getting stupid penalties and you're playing with a little too much emotion and not doing what your job is you know if you if you watch any college football\nAnd uh and you see a team that can run the football\nThe the player's supposed designed to go to a certain hole a in a certain place in the line of scrimmage but lots of times that running back cuts the cuts back\n... cut back line our defenses predicated and based on guys getting in a gap and staying in that gap when he says gap control\nHe means if it's the left tackle or the left linebacker in the play is designed to go away from them that they don't over pursue so that the backside gaps they build with people so that wouldn't have back tries to cut it back\nThat there are people there we had more than one guy and in in a gap\nAnd I don't think it's a ... a lack of effort as much as it's not playing your position it's eleven guys on appeal everyone has a specific position to play and job to do in that defense and we just weren't doing it now second half our gap controls a lot better\nUm and we played a lot better defensively but I don't have a ... an answer for what we did offensively and what we didn't do it was a freshman\nI think as I said earlier I think that plays into you know what we do best ... you know coach a much capital granted\nA coaching coverage in teaching those guys to really line up in one\nOf defense show him on looking at the snap of the ball get into another from a secondary coverage so I expect to see a lot of that I expect to see some man I think he'll switch stuff up on him but the bottom line is we put ... if we put lock in third or short\nThird one third into because we're not able to keep them from a gain in big yards on first and second down it could be a long day and as we talked last week\nThe officer's got to come on and have some consistency and it doesn't even mean that they've got the score every Dr they've got to change field position they've got to eat some ... they've got to move the football even if they don't score so it's it runs hand in hand but yeah it was the original throw the ball over the place\nToday I I really do believe so Missouri today am next week\nHow crucial is for the game talks to go out and and what a football game today with a and M. knock it and boy you dropped to inroads here\nIt's tough you know it is true for you know and and I I hate\nTo say this but I mean if we don't have some success and the next couple of weeks then\nYou really have to look at the some of the positions are and some of the things you got going on and make some plans for the long haul 'em you know if we're not moving to football if we're still making terrible mistakes um yeah I look at\nMost of the\nGood teams in college football now they do have a quarterback that can hurt you with his feet\nAnd we're not ... they're now maybe as Joyner who wins and joined us today yeah and maybe you know we continue to stay on and not very good on all ... we need the somebody young that can run the football as well as throw it will not throwing up very well no\nYou know we're not running it very well so I mean you know I\nThink if ... if we don't win today and we don't win next week then I think coach bus chance got some hard decisions to make\nWas how do they last week 'cause I usually get healthier receivers Emanuel hauling a brown do should both be back from going injuries receive a return or a rich shot\nFloyd close to coming back for a broken bone in his foot he suffered that back in August strong safety Kim Hilton playing into a club after having some surgery\nYou ever have to do that because it is fun buying people with yeah yeah it's like a carrying a big ... where the referees come in and check you to make sure there's not like some brass knuckles or something and taping their doors yeah the game talks and fair and John next week as them dumps of town and it seemed that are getting talks to never speak to them by the way\nThere you go next seven counties rhythm back for

Eric Wilson [noise]\nMore here\nAs always at the circle and BP station on bluff road right across from Williams Bryce stop by and say hello to us we're broadcasting from our jak from architect of Columbia getting ready for Carolina Missouri good crowd on hand at least so far early as they start to flow into Williams Bryce oh a lot of parents here for\nFamily weekend and who else this year Josh Jindal game got beat writer for the state newspaper with the state of the game actually better busy couple of days\nYeah always ah when the starting quarterbacks health is in doubt it's always an interesting week\nAnd you broke the news of course about Jake Bentley yesterday that it looks like Michael scar next year we'll get to start this afternoon\nI think my understanding is Michael told during the week he would be the star that he was the guy now\nWe saw jak Bentley walk in about twenty minutes ago within the last name right down will much chance we'll watch him I think is probably doing that right now and just just see if they you know if he can Willis rate out there to get the shot of adrenaline and he feels okay\nAnd he feels like you can play I still expected to be Michael Scott ... but I don't think we know a hundred percent right now I I don't like what must share that was a hundred percent right at this ...\nThis injury almost comes at a good time otherwise would there have been a controversy about should Bentley started yeah I mean I\nI was asking the question before the we understood how serious the injury might be just the same have confidence in jak Bentley because you could see where it might be it wouldn't six touchdowns in six interceptions twenty two interceptions in his career die off it is just not clicking\nThat's not an object mentally spot but some of it is in regards to how much of it really is he's a quarterback it falls is they they get all the credit I get all the blame is part of the\nJudge scandals with us from the state newspaper Josh what do we know based on very short resumes and even shorter when for to carry on a joiner but what do we know about Michael ... and joined or who is now officially the backup quarterback for the um\nYou you might be able to replay this and for hours and I sound like a complete idiot but I think that\nMichael Scott ... had the ability to play really well I think there's a possibility especially against him is already fenced is not all that that Michael Scott ... could play well enough today that people say wait a minute jak been like that or you know Jake Bentley three intersections against Kentucky and we lost Michael ... comes in and doesn't do anything very flashy\nBut we want and he looked you know he was you know twenty or thirty or something like that I don't know what I don't but I think Michael ... is very smart I think Michael's going to ask you understand the ... I think you operate everything very well I think he has enough physical ability to get them through a game like that and I think you'll be fine joiner\nIs the real wild card for me I think that there is no question Eric and I talked about this earlier you've got to have a package ready for him today because you didn't you don't know didn't know what was going on with jak Bentley you don't know about Michael despite my confidence any none of us really know it goes out there when the lights come on\nIt just didn't click for him you got to have a plan B and plan B would be to carry and joined her I Would like running the ball a lot\nThat's not a terrible plan B actually plant say at this point after ... ... ... that's a pretty good points the but we'll see\nThe other question and maybe it's been buried a little bit because of the injury news if it's not the quarterback do they start to be concerned about the system where they knew offensive coordinators likes to see [noise] [laughter] I don't know\nYou I don't know that you can get to questioning the system yet because first of all before you know anything about the system you gotta catch passes and you got a quick turn on the ball over I mean that we just don't we haven't had the ability to evaluate the system I don't think because the execution has been so rag yet\nThat they had they haven't had the ability to\nShow to to execute the system really all they had to have had the ability to execute the system they have not done that so I don't think we know anything about the system so that's kind of leads me into a good question and that is you've got a pretty experienced\nOff into group here you've got a starting quarterback who's been here for three years Ron Edwards has a lot of planes variants debo Samuel is one of the the most dynamic players in the country last year\nAnd I think just from when you look at that there's a number of things were that hurts you is it gives a short feel so the opposing off ants which made it easier for them to score\nYou're not creating short fields yourself which means you got a foot long drives in place to school\nSo to do that and I think we've got to talk about why is that happening I think Jake Bentley's not reading his progression is the way you should a lotta times he's trying to force the ball into brief nap reads and then in terms of of bumbling\nOne of the things that I've noticed is just basic fundamentals Rico doubt or a couple of games go I noticed on one of his bumble you'd actually trying to exchange the ball between hands\nBefore he crosses the line of scrimmage on one of the biggest things you teach running back to two hands over the ball through the line of scrimmage you don't even get to a one hand carry until you're to the linebacker level you've got the ball on one hand and he's tried to transfer it to the other hand\nRight after he takes the exchange so fundamental things like that have got to get better or this turnover things not going to uproot\nAnd you're worried about that a little bit more with a new cog in the wheel you got a new quarterback so the quarter back in ... new meaning Michael ... he had not necessarily new to the team but certainly knew as far as starting in playing a complete game for South Carolina you've got the quarterback center exchange you get ... running backs et cetera\nYeah and we saw the ball on the ground twice just last week when he was in the game so it's just it doesn't have anything to do is is he good it has to do is watch the comfort and and the the feeling of of just being out there what's getting used to the snap getting used to or there are some times where South Carolina ensure yard situations have gone under center which I like\nBecause it gives you the ability to get to hardball the run but that's just one more thing when you put a different quarterback in the game his hand positioning under the center every one's a little bit different you know in the ... and Donald families used to snap at the ball to Bentley badly badly and all of a sudden ... comes in maybe your hands are a little bit different place all those things matter so\nYou know they're not doing well to begin with\nHopefully you know with the addition of somebody different every one kind of dialing on those little things knowing hey we can't screw this stuff up because we've got other things to compensate for\nAll right we'll see we'll set ... much more on this afternoon game across the street in a moment first let's check out the big highlight reel it's brought to us by\nBig boy cards as the game ... stumbled their way around in Lexington last week costing Carolina a chance to break that annoying string to the wild cats and the Carolina mistakes started early against seventeenth rank Kentucky is air just mentioned misuse on the game got spurs to drives set the tone for the night\nFor\n\nThey had of course he did in [noise]\nAnd I've never\n\nDone large calling the SEC Network last week that Rico devil stumble at the seven led to the first point to the game only three there\nAs a beer or false starts sports the Wildcats to keep the Ogle the game graduate answer with a park or white twenty nine you order and it was three three going into the second quarter but penalties and for tackling quickly got Kentucky into the end zone twice [noise]\nUp goes Russia [noise]\nAnd\nJust like that it was Seventeen Bree wild cats and they were done to Jake Bentley interception led to a ... it was twenty four to three Kentucky to break it wasn't an insurmountable lead though the third quarter started with a missile Wildcats the Ogle followed by Carolina cashing in\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd then\nTurn it into something a fifty yard touchdown evil\nAnd that Judy along with a park or white went after suddenly got Carolina within two scores of good junkie but that's where the game would stay as penalties injuries and turnovers all took their toll [noise]\n[noise] looking to be [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] it does but it can be friends with\nTold her to see the SEC Network is ... ... ... ... three interceptions didn't leave the game late to hurt the seventeenth rank Kentucky held on to be ... were gender Wildcats fifth\nStraight victory in the series and that's a look back at the game ... the big highlight reel Roger was by big boy carts Carolina ... playing the early game there are some other early games out there this afternoon let's say you're back to a game got control Rob Sanders with a preview\nToes I'm watching about for early games today in addition to of course Carolina and Missouri I've got Boston College in in the state in the state is about six and a half points favorite in that game Texas and Oklahoma and interesting match up in the big twelve Oklahoma is favored by seven and a half\nAnd I'm going to watch the Alabama Arkansas game to simply because\nNick Saban was angry last week I think because his team did not cover the seven touchdown spread they're thirty five and a half point favorites today we'll see if they can cover that instant coach they've been home happy\nOh All right Rob I don't think Nick's savings ever happy but we'll see let's check in now with former game got quarterback Steve Danielle and Steve it's all about your old position today Jake Bentley still apparently with at least a shot to play this afternoon what her coaches looking for as they watch him and as they watched that injured knee in pre game or months\nWhile they're ... they're probably just looking to see how is um you know the injuries respond and uh if he can move around if you if he feels comfortable obviously the kid probably wants to play\n'em and I would want to play so you know that they'd be treatment all week and and everything I had to do to play but uh if he didn't take a lot of ribs and breakfast that's a concern\nUm specially coming off a game which he didn't play as best\nHopefully you know ... ... ...\nInjury or be fined and he'll be able to play but you know it'll be that pre game warm up so I Would imagine unless it's just a smokescreen and you know he's not plan you know all along\nYeah the state newspaper reporting the Bentley is seen very few practice reps this week so that's another indication that you're getting another quarterback ready to play and you put ... in the rearview mirror well\nI mean because of the injury or or you know they they feel like he's not going to be ready Saturday um and and a ... from what I understand had a really good preseason camp um and he's come along real well and and uh we'll find out that this isn't an easy game by all means\n... coming off the game where we didn't play well at all so um is a big shake up this is a big opportunity for the young man for sure\nFormer ... quarterback Steve ... with us Steve ... as a coach how confident are you you had a week's time to get ... ready at the same time Bentley's your field general ... is seen the fielding games in very little action well\nI mean you want your started to play I mean there's a reason that the Jake was our starter in you know\nUh and and you want him to play again coming off a disappointing game and headed into another tough SEC game\nUm this isn't the best thing for the fence or you know I I started forty games in a row here so I I I played every week and it and it helps um there's you know different ... different how every everything's different when you go to the next guy\nEven though he's the starter its its though everything's different you know he he's going to do different things than Jake did and and uh you know maybe it'll give it are often a boost I'm I'm I'm Still you know I still think Jake's our best you know our best guy we got to have help all around them and that's the thing when the backup comes in everyone else has to play\nPick up their game some um ... if we go out and play like we did last week is not going to matter so um we can have the drops we we can't bumble the ball in the five we we need to we need to do everything right and the players around the quarterback need to need to play better\nLet's talk about last week's game for a second because it is almost perpetuates the theory that a lot of people have had and that is that Jake Bentley presses too much in the big games well\nI don't know that it's him all the time you know if you look at the last few big games we've had at night last year Clemson we throw pick six early this year Georgia or the the ... election\nPick six um and then this week here we are in a big atmosphere\nAnd um Kentucky who's playing good and we turn it over in the first series at the five yard line with the with the ... so we we kill ourselves in these big games or not I don't necessarily think it's all Jake's fault 'em but we we don't play very and we haven't played very good in these big night games I'm here recently\nSteve ... with is the former game got quarterback also the owner of sheep to any hills group therapy do you like each day games is that better for business or is it ... the night games where people go straight from the stadium to\nWear nice definitely in games or the day games are better the night games with all the traffic is just hard for people to get from the stadium down so the day games are better\nUm it's a little tougher on everybody um but the the the day games give ... give people at the game or a opportunity to get out of traffic and and get back and go eat and income around and go out when and helps everything so that we need to win some football games that helps and uh\n... you don't want to say ... because there are Georgia kinda made its own luck but two big mistakes\nAre fumbled it was ripped out that Georgia return for a touchdown and then a block on at Georgia return for a touchdown and you can't take away those two places that happened but if you take away those places it was a it was an even gay\nOr he was able to run the ball on Georgia or they slow down Georgia's running game so they felt good about a lot of what happened in that game but they realize that it was it was really a missed opportunity\nUm to catch George on a day when George wasn't playing great so there's a lot of the teen clean up\nA special teams are the big area they've they've had some some glaring mistakes there or they can't return a punch at all which which have struggled with um a lot the last\nTwo years really um and and then the turnover is it is a big issue I mean you just you can't beat a good team when it turned over ratio is three to one like it was in that game so there's there's there was a lot from er to feel good about but there was a lot to six also\nAnd one addition to this team since the last time we saw them Derek duly the new off into coordinator will ... says his old friend has brought a renewed dedication to the one game what have you seen ... first years the coordinator\nWell he's brought a little bit more of a a pro style approach um after spending the last five years the Dallas Cowboys wide receivers coach and he was always a little bit more of a pro style guy even when he was in college working under nic said then and then being you know the head coach in Tennessee so\nHe hasn't drastically changed Missouri's often there wasn't a whole lot to change after they did lead the league and\nAnd yards per game each of the last two years but I think he's brought a system that\nLock is much more comfortable with much more full field reads where he can go through is progression that have just cutting the field and half like ate it at\nA younger using their tight and more as receivers and it got more of a downhill running attack whether that's out of kind of a pistol formation or just out of their regular shot on that um and I think he's he's he's a different voice and I think this team\nFeels more comfortable more confident against elite ... whereas in the past and they could put up a lot of yard and a lot of points against um teams that weren't very good but they really struggled against the best he's entered the FCC how they feel like they've got a better shot\nOut with what ...\nWhat about the games for a moment they they matter as with is misery writer for the St Louis Post Dispatch ... even before the injury to Jake Bentley there were questions being raised about the game quarterback in his performance in nicknames\nConstrue Locke who obviously is putting up some months for numbers just like at the same kind of questions about big games especially SEC road games\nHe does um I think last year you know when they won ... games I wrote down the stretch I think he started to\nPeck away at that reputation a little bit um you know they they eat Florida and in Florida wasn't very good but they're still good defensive team um they'd be a bad tendency team but you know they it was it was a team we finally beat and that's the Eighteenth they did go on the road last year and beat Vanderbilt in Arkansas\nAgain not great teams by any means but those were solid road when it was absolutely at\nThe teams that he has struggled against the obviously um he hasn't he beat South Carolina uh back in the in two thousand Fifteen but but not since ... come on board um you know he had been beaten to retain like Alice you're\nAn Auburn um you know here he is not beaten Georgia so those things are still out the winning team that have gone out to eat a Bill Clinton bowl games at one double digit games that have been nationally ranked those are the those are the teams he hasn't yet and uh you know he's obviously got a chance\nUm you know the more chance of the season um and I I think winning today with what kind of ... ...
