W. W. dot Carolina fresh forums dot com we would love to hear from you there you can find a link to all of our stores in our store hours we hope you have a great we gardening and we'll talk to you next week\nSo we have to take a certain amount of our assets and set 'em over on the side and say these assets are earmarked for income in the future we make sure that those are guaranteed that they can't lose and then we take a certain percentage of our assets and depending on your risk tolerance we put those at risk based on what potential for\nLast you're willing to accept\nNow those are not guaranteed so you have to take some risk with that but the key to the whole discussion is this we were given a reprieve since two thousand and seven to two thousand nine where we had\nCorrections in the U.S domestic stock market domestic equity markets losses over fifty percent we had to go back to work we had to stay at work we had to help those accounts by continually funding those IRAs and four O. one K. is so we saw the rebound we saw come back and\nFor some that did the lay retirement and so you have to keep that in mind if you are one of those ones that kind of said I'll Wait till I got back to break even\nYour back past break even now now's the time to look at things again and say do I want to experience this same definition of insanity let's call it do I want to continue to do the same thing and expect different results because as I\nSaid earlier the market will go up and it will go out we just don't know when so we need to have a plan that will work for our\nFinancial stability and security regardless of what condition we might see throughout the future and certainly throughout our retirement\nThat's true and so we don't want to change anything that we've always known is that we have to be properly diversified we have to look at where our income is going to come from and retirement what sources it's going to come from and that we have a proper income allocation plan\nSo that we can make sure that our money lasts as long as we needed to that's supposed to provide the income\nNow I'll just share this because people still are saying well that's the same thing dark he's always said let's hear something different from turkey let me just share this with you we feel that this year should be positive\nThat doesn't mean that things can go down this team twenty percent there may be a correction it's how long it takes to recover from that if you're in your accumulation years that is your determination of how much risk you want to say\nBut if you are taking income out of those assets to live on right now you've already retired you cannot afford to have a Fifteen twenty twenty five percent drop and not expect that that's going to significantly affect how long money will last beyond your retirement lifetime\nAnd break if somebody does not have that way and if they don't have the confidence in their plan or even if they do have some\nConfidence that they have done a good job planting but just want to try to fill a holes identify potential red flags that may have been left on addressed that is what you and the rest of the

a hundred and four nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred for nine one six two two zero so Rick we've talked about all the progress that we've made since two thousand seven eight and nine the great recession we've come a long way\nWe don't know exactly what's in store but if we have properly structured our plan this should be a year where we make Ford strides in financial progress but are there any particular things that you are warning people to stay away from in their investment lives\nPete I think it these times when the market's going up and we're a little bit greedy you know we want to take part in that we need to address things from a standpoint of risk we need to make sure that we stay away from too much risk on those assets that are providing our income for us\nAnd kind of get away from that accumulation mentality that we grew up on as we built up our assets in the eighties in the nineties and then saw them really stay flat in the decade of two thousand two thousand and ten\n... we've talked about the balance of the foundational fundamentals of planning and putting some investments in place to have growth over time maybe a couple of home runs out there but I Know\nYou help people create that balance what event for maybe ... people in your life or in flew into in your view of money and finance and how to balance these two sides of our coins so to speak\nWell Pete I got to go back in time here and share this information as far as my listeners go many of 'em are tuned to this already but\nI'll share it with some people that may be recently joined us on the show here than in the financial services industry for now going into my twenty fifth year so I got to go back to when I first came into the business and I met this fella and he was a first generation Greek immigrant\nHe taught me many lessons I Would say that he would be one of my key financial mentors in my life he was a multimillionaire already and this was twenty five years ago folks he'd say I get calls from financial advisors all the time wanting to manage my money said I'd tell them no I'm not interested because he had built as well on his own\nAnd he didn't think that anybody could come along at this point in life and helped him\nWhich overtime he learned from me that I could even at that young point in my career that I could help him by doing research for him he asked me what do you think about this or what can you find out about this and I would do the research on it for him so he found me very useful as far as helping him to build his well\nAnd that would come back to me many many times in in his wisdom that he shared with me throughout the years where I knew him first generation Greek immigrant came to this country with not a penny in his pocket\nWent to the University of Illinois graduated in finance with a finance degree and ended up working up in Cincinnati for the city of Cincinnati and the accounting department and work there is whole career\nHis wife meanwhile they had a son and his wife worked at Proctor and gamble\nAnd so they were able to live on his income alone\nFrom the city of Cincinnati and everything that she earned\nTypically somewhere in that prioritizes list is going to be developed a written income plan and income allocation plant\nAnd so that was their number one goal they know that they needed to do that so we put together the information that we needed we looked at their current budget we looked at their current sources of revenue and income that's going to come in to them their Social Security their pension\nTheir other self directed IRAs that we would convert to dollars we put that together into an income allocation plant\nAnd when they walked out they were very happy to find out that their plan took them all the way out into their mid nineties and if we made a few more tweaks along the way they were only in their mid sixties now but in that thirty year span if we made a couple of weeks 'cause we reviewed the plan\nOn a regular basis and made adjustments to it to make sure that we stayed on track that we would reach\nThis end goal and maybe got 'em out to age one hundred or longer\nThis is many times in people's plans the root of doubt and worry and the concern of running out of money is that they have not gone through this process of actually\nMapping out how to translate in transition to lump sum into the income that they will need to fail because uh we have not calculated that income gap we don't know\nHow much income we may need to fill and have not taken into account\nThe taxation on what what draws we will make to fill that income gap but it is a mathematical process we don't have to base this on speculation or projections so if people would just know the process and know how to identify that income gap it would help to alleviate a lot of the time that we spend worrying and concern that we have\nThat we may run out of money in retirement\nThe problem is is that no one has ever taught us that process and so what we have to do is we have to look at situations here that are made available to us where you can educate yourself on this process\nOf how to go through and develop your game plan for retirement with the proper income allocation model\nAnd then use that information to take you into in throughout your retirement are traditional models of how to accumulate wealth\nHaven't been that hard to do especially here over the last five or six years we've seen very good growth in our accounts I had one lady that came into in the last seven years has doubled her three hundred and fifty thousand dollar account that she had for her four oh one K.\nBut the problem was is she was only in one bond and is it done fantastic but it's time now to take that\nAnd build a retirement income allocation plan so that it can provide the income that she needs because she's retiring in January and\nIt's time to look at how do we create income from that asset pool instead of just continually trying to grow it and we need to look at the possibility of risk of what if we do have\nAnother downturn like we did in two thousand and seven to two thousand nine and you're in a growth stocks on you're going to see some significant losses and not so certainly diversification but also rebuilding your plan from a thought process of accumulation to\nA income plan where you're actually taking that money and you're using it to create your income because in the past\nYou got a check and now he's got to develop that jak from what you said\nIf you have questions or or concerns about how you will generate income if you'd like to find out more about that process if you've seen significant gains in your accounts over the last ten years but also realize that that could\nAnd probably does indicate that you are also exposed to a large or significant amount of risk in your portfolio of the market is to move in the opposite direction then I encourage you to pick up the phone give a call being in touch with Rick turkey\nAnd the team from coastal financial planning group they love to help you through this process and show you how to structure that\nFoundation for retirement and identify and and fill your income gap and minimize the stress and strain on your personal assets identify what is needed for income and what's left over and discretionary for growth for spending for legacy or whatever other needs you have throughout retirement but not\nAffecting your standard of living in the minimum amount of income that you will need to live on through our retirement give a call ... eight hundred for nine one six two two zero\nThat's eight hundred for nine one sixty two twenty Richter he would love to hear from any

you and reviewing your plant\nThose complimentary strategy session is designed to provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions to put you in control of your financial future\nTo schedule a complementary review of your retirement portfolio and your game plan for retirement call your local retirement advisor Rick dirty at eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred\nFor nine one six to to the [noise]\nBack here on your game plan for retirement with the president and founder of coastal financial planning group your guide through retirement he is Rick turkey\nAnd from the middle instead of low country or resource for commonsense approach to planning ladies and gentlemen if you've got questions or concerns pick up the phone and give a call the eight hundred for nine one six two two zero that's eight hundred\nFor nine one sixty two twenty Rick we talk about the amount of concern in doubt and worry that people have when making that transition to retirement and making their way through retirement all the things that\nCould derail their financial security go through their minds quite frequently and that's why we see that concern my question is\nIf the status quo was working so effectively if the conventional wisdom on\nHow we are structuring our plans was effective what do we see that kind of concern would we see the don't worry that we will run out of money and rhetorically questioning that I don't think that we would so can you talk to us about the fact\nThat the model that we are following actually creates some of the instability in our financial foundation through retirement\nPeter when we look at the models that have been taught traditionally here in our accumulation years it's by and hold it's okay if we lose some money because we're not spending any money out of the accounts yet we're just growing are well we're in a roast mode\nAnd so now there is a major shift that happens once we have to depend on that money you hurt your conversion of paychecks to play checks I call it in retirement now\nYou still need to get a paycheck 'cause you need to cover your bills and what's your fix expenses are but you should also have a play checked for some of the dollars that you were going to end on discretionary items such as travel or home improvements or for that college fund for your grandchildren but\nHere's what the issue is here that I think we need to talk about right now is what are those conventional strategies traditionally and and you've seen them here recently on the TV the question arises is what's your retirement number\nNow when we do that type of strategy planning we don't look at first what our risk issues and opportunities when we're trying to calculate how much money we're going to need by just looking at the number that we're going to create as a lump sum to create the income we need and we're not looking at the risk were subject to\nWe have longevity risk\nBecause we don't know and that's our worry is in that model is we don't know how long this money may last and the reason we don't know it is because the money is subjected to another risk called sequence risk or what will the market do when we're drawing money out of it\nSo people often wonder\nHow much is enough to retire and Wall Street models really give us general guidelines but we shouldn't base are possibilities of retirement here on hypothetical returns are past performance\nNeither of which can be guaranteed we want that certainty that you mentioned earlier in our plan we want a high degree of confidence that we're not going to run out of money with this pool of money that we've saved so\nIt's a thought process that you certainly need to do to define your income gap and look at it from another strategy perspective defining that income gap as we're talking about today using an income allocation model\nAnd then creating a strategy that can give us the best of both worlds and certainly replace worry in doubt with confidence and certainty\nTheir concern was that the market is starting to do a little bit of volatility here now and I saw it go down and I don't really like that and I said okay well here's your two choices number one we can\nKeep it where it is keep it invested and then we have the risks of longevity and also sequence of returns risk that could make that pool of money runs out um during our payout years\nWe could take it and we could develop our own pension check with that are self directed pension plan I'll call it and we could guarantee that for\nA lifetime period a lifetime period was survivorship just like our pension plans offered us when we used to be able to take that\nPension option and create lifetime income but the downside of that is is when you do that you're committing all of your assets to one option either way and those two options\nJust said what if we could blend those two options what if we could come up with an income allocation model that said we'll reached that required minimum distribution on the guaranteed side and what we'll do is create a lifetime income for both of you with survivor benefits so that that income will keep on going\nAll the way through retirement even as cool money runs out and they said well that's a pretty good idea because you know what will probably get used to get that income payment and we don't want it to run out even though he's got these other sources of income that will be living on two at the same time\nSo we're not dependent on that money but we sure want to be good stewards for it and make sure it lasts as long as we do and hopefully it'll last longer than us\nSo that we can pass it on so we developed a strategy in income allocation plan\nWhere we took a percentage of the assets and then we provided the required minimum and distribution payment that was\nGoing to go through both of their lifetimes if either one of them live longer than the other and then we took the remaining balance a percentage and we invested that at risk and then that's a pool of money that's fully liquid and can grow and do what you used to do with\nThe lion's share of your retirement plans during your accumulation years let it grow so that it's there and it can provide that extra bucket list thing that you want to do like take the trip around the world or you know pay for that\nCollege education for a child or grandchild this way we could certainly have the best of both worlds we had guarantees that we would certainly calculate how much we would need to meet our baseline retirement expenses\nAnd then we had the extra amount that was invested in an income allocation plan for a future needs or perhaps to pass on his legacy\nRick very reassuring there to know what portion of our money is necessary that we can't afford to take risk with\nAnd what portion is more discretionary or available to us to spend out of what's out depleting the asset based that will need to generate that income into future years and I think that's where the concern is what the traditional Wall Street model if we spend today\nHow do we know we're not depleting the assets we need for income into the future and that's what the income allocation model does it separates out the money it formulates two plans and provides a lot of additional clarity\nAnd uncertainty in the planning process and that's something that probably if people want more information on they should find out about this income allocation and and how it could benefit them\nStart with lower and a copy of the book did they call us up one eight hundred for nine one six two two zero and we'll get that copy of the book income allocation\nOut to you it talks about these fundamental plan issues that we've talked about today on your game plan for retirement it'll help you to understand how do I start this process of education and how do I learn about how the\nCompanies that use to provide me pensions how they did it and now how I Need to do that for myself so let's create that retirement income play on the income allocation plan let's make sure we go through a process of discovery and learn how these financial decisions are going to affect us\nFrom attacks planning standpoint when a certainly when we want to uh\nWhere we take our income sources from we want to know how much we're going to pay in taxes on those so that we can favorably work through retirement with the income allocation model that factors in taxes\nThe second thing that we're going to look at in this decision making process is how much income do we need how do we make sure that we're taking care of those fix expenses and retirement\nAnd then thirdly we're going to look at what risks do we want to make sure that we address now before they have any potential for happening so that were planned and we're doing some forward planning\nAnd avoiding some of the risks the potholes in that road map through retirement that we definitely want to avoid Pete there's one thing that I often say about money and what it can do for us there's four things that are money can do for us during our accumulation years and during our retirement years\nAnd that's it that's all they can do Okay Number one they can grow number two they can be safe number three they can be liquid and number four they can provide income the shift happens from gross\nTo provide an income when we go into retirement\nAnd money is actually a terrible multi task or it really can only do two of these things effectively at any one time or in any one type of investment so if you take too much income you could run out that's the problem we've been talking about today\nA money ... in the market can certainly grow and his liquid but sometimes it's too liquid sometimes it's not safe\nAnd so we want to make sure that our money is working as hard as it can for us and it is working in the direction that we needed to either grow be safe to be liquid or provide income\nAnd Rick that's what that review process in your office is all about assigning tasks assigning specific jobs for our dollars in identifying what their purpose is a so that we can have more clarity and confidence in the planning process\nThat's exactly right the and so what we want to make sure as we're looking at all of the different pieces of this puzzle were putting together this puzzle with the proper ideas in mind to avoid risks to make sure we're taking advantage of opportunities\nAnd making sure that we are as we said earlier in a high degree of confidence that we have a plan that can be achieved\nAnd we're replacing worry in doubt with certainty and a plan that we feel will take us through retirement fairly safely\nRick has given several special offers on today's program where you can get the information to help you build and have that confidence uh the class\nOf events that he is holding the book income application if you'd like a copy of that if your retirement minded\nThe first ten dollars to the program can receive a copy of income application or the complimentary review and strategy session the ... person time to learn how to design and

hundred people you're right you're in the state of South Carolina very military not just military friendly military appreciative\nI'm In likewise for for other uniform servants like police officers in the like and we're sad to hear of the um the tragedy that happened in Florence a while back but you know it's not so unusual is too sad anymore I was just reading about in the past five days we've had three border a border patrol agents assaulted\nA on our southern border we got way too many law enforcement officers in military members in the light getting hurt in situations where they shouldn't\nNeedlessly to be honest with you just like you just mentioned in Florence South Carolina\nWhen we saw the police officer thirty year veteran serving a warrant guy goes for the second floor

country has folks coming through Mexico which means no one knows where they're from\nIn the president's strong desire\nTo push to break on countries like Honduras and around the country world\nToying with Senator Tim Scott I got a quick two prong question here for you is the first part of the question is\nAnd I'm I'm Wondering do you agree with me and a lot of conservatives who say that Robert Mueller's investigation appears to be as Trump would call it a witch hunt and or just very partisan and the way he staffed it\nThere was no doubt that there are a ton of Democrats who have made contributions democratic candidates on the Miller team number one number two it is clear to me and it should be clear to everyone who watched any part of the investigation that Russia and collusion\nIs not the primary focus and it doesn't seem to be the secondary focus\nThey are reaching for straws and if you if you pay attention to any of the ... agreement\nAnd has nothing to do so far with the president not going to do with Russia but business transactions that predate the election that is by definition which\nIs the second part of the question is if he is a partisan and who's trying to bring down Trump I find it very good news that he's not going to release his or any of his findings till after the midterms do you agree well\nTwo things I think that they feel like this this investigation should've been could have been wrapped up in September as relates to Russian losing questions and we should have already had that answer one of the norms the traditions that have been broken again\nHas been as these investigations head towards the ... election that their their fight a lot we've had plenty of time to finalize the investigation I think we should finished investigation I think however it should have already been finished\nHigh that they will release information after the election as opposed to releasing it between now and the next twenty ... twenty days or so smart but we should have already had conclusions because it's clear\nThe coup look the conclusion do not include\nPresident Russia collusion collaborating and or any other word that you might use are they sending them to convince\nMy wife says hello cause she calls your office every day especially during the Kavanaugh hearings she didn't get to speak to you directly but she spoke to your staff and she said they were always very friendly and apparently we're writing down every word\nI Am very proud of that I was on the phone with the interns in my at my other staff members during those calls will die could here from the constituents one on one so they can tell me their stories they were surprised to hear from me I was a excited to hear from them I Am a static on the way that it\nTurned out there has to be if a you know the premise of our nation is one built on freedom freedom is built on liberty liberty is built on justice\nWe have to have the rules in place for a person that still innocent until proven guilty and you have to have a process in place to discern that true and that has nothing to do with the me too movement a lot of folks have been struggling and challenge and assaulted we should deal with that but we can't come\nEvery issue\nOf all places on the shoulders of cabinet showed her that\nWell again we really appreciate all the time people should
