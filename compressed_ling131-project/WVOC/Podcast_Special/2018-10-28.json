[laughter]\nLove to throw curve balls and just just keep ... too so yeah for the next one we're just gonna lumber a bunch of things together into anything that would be considered a retirement account of the first things that would probably obviously come to mind would be a four one K. or traditional or off IRA if you work for a nonprofit it'd be a four three be typically\nI'm going to throw pensions in there as well so anything that is a retirement plan essentially that either you control or that an employer controls and these are like you said probably where you thought we were going to start and of course these are hugely valuable and the pension in the retirement accounts of course are very different so pensions\nAre incredibly valuable right now because they have that opportunity to provide you income that you can count on at least hopefully depending on what type of pension that you have\nAnd they're of course is disappearing so we're not seeing those as much\nSo most people end up with that traditional i._r._a. and that four one K. and that's a huge asset to have but now all of a sudden the responsibility is shifting tremendously and a generation ago that responsibility for retirement income was on the employer or the government who is offering the pension\nThat has now been shifted heavily on to our listeners shoulders because now if you are retiring with a four O. one K.\nYou've got to figure out what the heck to do with that and how to turn it into income\nSo that's where it's very valuable to be kind of giving this some thought and thinking about okay how do I go from actually getting a paycheck to now having this asset which is a wonderful thing but I Need to generate income from it and those are some of the big planting decisions that we find our clients are struggling with\nAs they are approaching retirement or you know within five ten Fifteen Years of retirement\nPat let's talk about some of those options for what to do with the four oh one K. because at four O. one K. is in like a pension where you just have choices that a lump sum payment or an annuity paint and there is a little bit more to it than that right\nThat's exactly right and for a long time with four O. one K. is that was just the way it was you were going to have a lump sum there\nOne of the things there's been a big push as people have realized what a struggle there is to plan for retirement now it's been a huge push to offer some type of way to convert that four one K. into an income stream which would essentially be some type of uh nudey program inside the four o one K [laughter]\nIt's a very very rare for us to see that right now but that is a trend that we're watching to see if that becomes available so another option that's available\nIs when you are approaching retirement or retiring you off and have the opportunity to roll out your four one K. or a portion of it\nAnd one thing that some people are considering or looking at is taking a chunk of that money\nAnd putting it into an annuity that's going to offer some type of guaranteed income now there are as many different types of annuities as you can possibly imagine so you know that goes well beyond you know the amount of time we have on the show today but the bottom line is there are different types of annuities that can essentially create some type of guaranteed income for you\nWe like to call that kind of a personal pension and it would be very unusual for someone to work at an employer for a long time and then roll the entire four one K. into an annuity and taking them off of it that's not what we're talking about for most people the annuity is a piece and trying to figure out based on that four one K. what makes the most sense for you\nAs far as uh using that to turn on income and this comes back to we talk about five areas of retirement planning that we want and you're a comprehensive plan their estate planning in health care planning and tax planning but the two that really for most people are on their minds all the time or\nHow do I invest my money as they approached retirement and I'm In retirement and then how do I generate income from it and that's really kinda piecing those two things together\nSo while there are a lot of different things we need to talk about when we're sitting down with someone those are things that we can often provide a lot of answers for it and really we find even in that first new costs new obligation review you can get some peace of mind 'cause you can talk through those things and kind of see where you stand\nAnd see where you are right now and if you're on that track to accomplish our goals to take advantage of the new costs new obligation review call now at age ... three nine retire mentioned the savior retirement radio show\nIf you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call man with a two or three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three we've reserved space on the counter for listeners the today show that we do not have a large number of spots available so call now at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nTalking today with pat ... is the founder of preservation specialists\nI'm generally jak alongside and studio working our way through a list of most valuable assets for retirement and now they're one\nPath that is on our list and some people wonder just how valuable it is or what the chances of being valuable in the future are that would be Social Security let's talk about that one how do we maximize this how do we make sure it's on our list is valuable assets\nYeah it's funny Gen I've been in financial planning for Twenty one years now and for the first half of my career and no one even talked about social\nAnd you're right it's a huge asset for most of us because we're you know funding it with our taxes for so much of our career and you know making the most of it is a really big deal so when you think about the benefits of Social Security first and foremost it's designed to pay out for a lifetime\nAnd of course we're assuming that you know our government can kind of shore up the finances\nBut that's the assumption that we have right now number two is a Social Security benefits do have some type of inflation protection or cost of living adjustment which is extremely valuable the thing that's nice about it although it can cause confusion is there's flexibility about when you can start those benefits so those are three really nice features\nAnd let's talk about some of the flexibility for when you start receiving your Social Security benefits that pat is where it can become the most valuable asset or not if you make the wrong decision here right\nIt absolutely is an engine sometimes we teach classes on Social Security options and I see you in the beginning of that class has a lot of stressed out faces because you know you're getting close to retirement a lot of times people are reading articles and they're hearing don't do this or watch out for this or\nThe biggest mistake your life and those types of things and that's the challenge with there's so much information these days it's hard to know what the follow so it's just important to know that generally speaking when planning for retirement their normal for retirement age is going to be either sixty six or sixty seven\nThe earliest you can claim Social Security would be age sixty two and then anyone's benefits can be deferred and continue to grow until at least aged Seventy is even an eight year window there\nThat's really significant and so how do you decide when to do that well there are so many factors and it really is incredibly valuable to get some type of projection done so you can see an analysis for you\nWe believe if you are an individual it's really eye opening to see what those numbers look like for you but if you're a married couple it can be just an enormous benefit because the way your benefits work together\nThere are literally hundreds of combinations of options maybe it makes sense for you to both take Social Security for retirement maybe it makes sense for one of you to take your benefits early in the other two different yours\nAnd if you're working with a plan or a a retirement plan or like us\nUh well we can do is we can try to help you evaluate if an annuity would be of benefit at all and if so what type might make sense and then we can kinda essentially shop the marketplace and try and find something that's a fit so the way that would work Jen is rather than being built into the four one K. there'd be some planning as to\nAt some point either near retirement or at retirement rolling some of that four one K. out into an IRA so there's no taxation to you and then using that IRA or a portion of that IRA to fund the newly opened\nAnd leave that sounds like a lot of steps but ultimately what we're trying to do is just to turn an asset which is a pile of money and your four one K. into a different type of ... which is a guaranteed income stream and that's one of those things that it's just different and\nA lot of people if you're approaching retirement is probably not the discussion on experience you've ever had and that's of course All right you know we don't expect you to be experts in this what we want to do is we want to be there as a resource for you to help guide you\nAnd maybe through that process we determined that that's not a fit for you I mean there's pros and cons to every type of planning area\nWe want to help you figure out what fits for you for some people it can be a huge benefit to help build up that kind of guaranteed income that you're planning for a on a monthly basis in in what we find is ultimately our job with you is to build out a written retirement income plan\nAnd you might say well what is the point of that well the point is you've got something you can look at and you can actually see where your incomes going to come from for the rest of your life what the plan is to do that\nAnd the goal there is really to just give you a tremendous amount of peace of mind to see you can see okay now I'm going away for a paycheck\nAnd now I see where I'm actually going to be able to live and can do to do things and I don't have to sit there and worry about what his money disappearing where's that going we found that so many people will just found an enormous relief from that type of process and that's why we offer our first meeting an absolutely no cost and no obligation we call it a retirement review\nAnd we offered an opportunity to sit down with one of our independent advisors help you uh look at your situation make sure you're right on track and help you see if it makes sense to start building weekly custom built retirement plan which means it's designed specifically for you the first step is to call us right now at age ... three nine retire\nWe've blocked off time in the next two weeks specifically for listeners of today's show but the spaces limited so call now it it was three nine retire if you save at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside in the studio pat just gave me the phone number\nThe website is retire with pat dot com if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we're talking about important assets most valuable asset for retirement and we've made this point before but again Patt\nSome of them are tangible some of them are really relating to dollars and cents things we might typically think God's when we think about our most valuable assets\nOthers are intangible and I want to spend a few minutes on some of those before we get to this next break tell me what are some of the valuable assets that aren't necessarily something we can pick up or look at it on a statement\nYeah this is one agenda that is so incredibly valuable and some of it's in our control and some of it that's your good health so depending on what kind of what stage you're at in life you\nKnow you may feel like you're in great health right now you may be struggling with health issues but this is something that's so important and it's one of those things and you know I'm forty four right now\nI can feel and maybe I'm much more empathy for someone whose retirement age now than I did last thirty four years of and so you start understanding the aches and pains and all those kinds of things but what's really happened in Twenty one years of experience for me is\nI realize how precious every day is and you just don't know what the future holds and that comes through in our planning because we really want to do is we want to find out what are you really want to do\nThat you mentioned this in the very beginning of the show\nDo you want to travel the world do you want to spend time with family with grandkids [laughter] um do you want to volunteer at your church what do you really want to be doing because we don't have any idea how long any of us are going to be here\nAnd we can't blow all your money in the first few years of retirement may you may live a long time\nBut at the same time the last thing I Want to do ... and I feel like a lot of people that plan for retirement and the financial world they just want you to sit on a pile of money and I just hate that thought of thinking that you missed out like you said you never get time back\nSo while you're younger and healthier and retirement let's find a way to help you enjoy and do the things that you want to do so one of the ideas\nIt may sound kind of silly but we talk about if you do have a longer retirement there's gonna be three stages stage one does that go go years things too is this logo in stage three is the no go and so we want your go go years to really be filled with all the things that are important to you\nAnd then we all understand that that's not going to last forever so we're probably going to slow down at some point\nAnd then we have the no go which means if we're still living and we're in our nineties you're probably not going to be jet setting to Europe or something like that right [laughter] so and we really just want to think about all these things and really help you accomplish the things that you've always wanted to accomplish and have the retirement of your dreams\nAnd the other thing to point out pat when we talk about your health and time\nReally what good is all of your wealth that you the ... is you no longer have the or health or as you said if you are too afraid to enjoy it I mean that really defeats the purpose of what you've been doing for so long right\nThat's exactly right Jan and one of the most rewarding things that we've learned how to do is when we're building those written retirement income plans we can build that lifestyle into it and what I mean by that is when I was raised my parents have always been very frugal you know their parents lived through the depression\nAnd so they've got that kind of mentality\nAnd it's good in a way that you're responsible and you know don't rack up debt and things like that but you also can miss out right and I will tease my mum all the time and say mom you don't have to feel guilty about doing something you know so they lean to that direction I mean so funny that balance to help you create a plan\nThat actually maybe put the budget in there for whatever those things are maybe for you you have grandkids that are spread out around the country and you want to go visit them so you've got a travel budget in there for those trips just whatever that thing is we want to make sure we budget and we put it in there and then takes the guilt away and it gives you that peace of mind\nTo know that it's all part of your planning because he's a comfort to know you're not blowing through everything and being reckless\nPat ... is the founder of preservation specialist I'm generally jak alongside in Studio ... again it goes back to the big unknown\nWould be how long you will live than because we don't know how long we need our assets to last we have to figure out how to\nPreserve then what about things like insurance pat is that something that is part of this list of most valuable asset for retirement\nIs Jen and this is one of those topics that you know we have a lot of different philosophies out there and you are someone who is worried about risk you might be heavy on insurance you might want to buy the most comprehensive insurance on everything meanwhile there are people who believe that insurance is a rip off and you want to pay as little as possible right\nWell there are some truth to each side and finding that balance for you is what really matters you know we talked about health insurance earlier maybe your personality is to have a very low deductible or maybe a high deductible is appropriate for you so it's not a one size fits all\nBut you want to have some type of insurance against major medical do you need life insurance that's the question we get a lot most people build up their life insurance if you're married with small children at the time that you might buy a lot of it\nAnd maybe still have it in your thinking why am I paying for this\nAnd it's a great question to ask because maybe those funds could be better used saving for retirement or something like that so we can do it in analysis of that also long term care insurance that the topic that is a very challenging one because nursing care costs are extremely expensive and of course none of us know support and need that\nAnd there are also insurance plans that kind of combined those things so there are life insurance policies where you can access the death benefit for nursing care if you need it at some point in retirement and then the final want to mention is Medicare supplements so we touched on Medicare earlier\nThere are a lot of different places that insurance can fit in\nWe are not insurance brokers per se gym that were you know kind of buying health insurance or Medicare supplements or anything ... that's part of the area we're helping guide you were helping you review options\nHelping you see basically can we make sure you're covered for his little cost as possible and ultimately we hope we're providing a value there to your point which is just preserving what you have and of course if we can do that with his little out of pocket money going to insurance companies as possible that's what we like and that's again", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Podcast
