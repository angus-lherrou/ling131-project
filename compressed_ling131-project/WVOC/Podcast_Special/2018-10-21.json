{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "A couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his sister ... eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian ... another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the it would only do three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up on us Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm\nJames ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building\nYou know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was trick she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nCheer 'em and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere in trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake\nHow all those lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com is the both the paperback and e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art do all those years ago and I recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona\nAbout fashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get to Dr Schwartz on the program again and follow up\nOn that yes thank you so much for this\nWell Richard you're an excellent host you have a good heart and the work you do is making the world a better place and I appreciate

on your hosts generally jak here alongside pat you know we recently saw a precipitous drop on Wall street if you're like most investors nearing retirement you might be wondering how this is going to impact you\nMy colleague Megan ... had the chance to sit down with financial educator and New York times best selling author David Baake for and insightful conversation about what this volatility means for you and retirement let's listen in\nOctober tenth saw the worst day where they down since February\nA big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's at nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finished rich and smart women finish rich and today he's co founder of a even wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nAnd it's great to be with you even though you know it's a little ugly in the markets it's still great thanks for having me on the show\nLet's talk about that an eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked this sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taken place over three or four so you know over a thousand pointed down on the handful you're scaring people and and so the question becomes all their things going on and I'll give you\nThe first thing is that right and you even heard the president talk well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising\nActually been raising rates really\nBut most recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can call that was fun chore record happening and when those rates went up a couple of things first of all the cost or a money right so you're going to borrow money for\nIf you're going to refinance if you're going to buy a car you're going to finance that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where's your or owing money the cost to borrow that money is now going on and that's\nAll folks the market right because if you're well maybe people will either by less home they'll refinance so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop when it costs more to borrow money\nThe markets can boots that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rate going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rate it really really really really low like you know we talk a little rich well over ten years and those historic got put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nAnd they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up the Kenya treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three or the tenure treasury is over three point one five to as I speak that means if you go and buy a ten year treasury are going to get a rate of\nThree point one five two percent and that's the highest rates we've seen on ten year treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happened and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't way like this right let me see no\nWe've seen a sell off in tech stocks particularly tech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so there's been some so often these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher company you know we call him saying companies like Facebook and\nAmazon and Netflix and Google use main tech companies have been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably you know about time for us to see tech stocks pull back\nI think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um all this talk of trade war with China\nIs having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world\nAnd so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a pre there to an almost\nA recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nSeveral components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street he but I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees is special retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement and the good news about race going higher is that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries\nAre going higher and in most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rights again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's a nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe\nYou know I've done other interviews on\nI Know that we're we've ... we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had\nAt the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] I don't know it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent\nSo it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties and America's pull back you can't afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you were retired your\n... your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nI don't know if it was dumb luck or if it was by strategy but you did a great job letting these and nine times out of ten they say oh it was dumb luck [laughter]\nAnd I think some of that humility because I Know they didn't necessarily know how that was going to benefit them but they also knew you know okay there's benefits to having a Roth IRA versus a four one K. what we're doing is we're taking all these different tools and concepts that you've been accumulating over decades and we're helping putting it into a cohesive plan where they all fit together so\nI think that's kind of the first step that I Would mention\nAnd then it ties in to that idea of you know diversification of tax consequences\nIt is very important certainly to be thinking about how that's going to pay out in the example that I always use is\nIf you just have everything has tackled retirement what you might be in a twenty two or twenty four percent tax bracket our tax strategies we want to try and do is it's not that you're probably never going to pay any income taxes in retirement but what if we can lower those brackets\nHow about a ten or twelve percent federal tax brag instead of twenty two or twenty four percent of those are the kinds of things that our clients can be very excited about and understand conceptually\nPatterns he talked about taxes I think one of the goals here is if we can save money on taxes we keep more of our money longer that can affect our retirement date as well right\nA huge huge factor Jim because of course we want to help you make as much return on your investments as you can but it's not just what you make it's would you keep and so if you are investing in generating great returns but Uncle Sam is getting a larger portion of that\nThat certainly doesn't make sense right so we really want those pieces of the puzzle all fit together we can generate good returns and also help you minimize taxes as much as possible that's the ideal and you know when I talk about that that kind of ties into what exactly are you doing with the nest egg\nHow are we trying to generate those returns and that's where it comes back to that diversification so we talked about diversity in how you are taxed on your accounts\nWe also want a tremendous amount of diversity on your investments and you know my soapbox speech on this topic is most financial firms want you to be in a pool of stocks and bonds or funds because those are easy to manage for them\nAnd our philosophy is there's just so much more out there and you can have a tremendous amount more diversity and reduce your risk\nAnd you can just be a tremendous value to you in retirement we talk about there being three worlds of money in retirement so you have that\nStock market or mutual fund a world and that's your growth world\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that that's where you have the potential for high returns but you also have a tremendous risk there as well on the other end of the spectrum you have the safe world so that's going to be accounts that have some type of account guaranteed to them that might be bank accounts or savings bonds or annuities have guarantees to them\nSo you're not going to of course expect as high of an average return on those accounts but they provide that safety that you need and retirement\nAnd then one of our areas that we work in a lot is the middle of the road world we call it a steady income world so these are not guaranteed accounts they are investments but they're not designed for all of the ups and downs to an swings of the stock market and the economy there just\nSigned usually to pay a nice steady income stream maybe five or six percent or something like that and that's one of those things when you're thirty or thirty five and you may be saving for retirement you're thinking well that doesn't sound appealing at all I can assure you when you get to sixty or sixty five that sounds a lot more interesting\nBecause you're switching away from this high growth long term mentality to how to preserve the principle as long as possible and generate as much income to enjoy my retirement so hopefully you can see how all these pieces kinda fit together or we figured out what you want to be doing in retirement what's going to cost now we're kind of filling out your nest egg\nTo create accounts that are going to actually generate that income\nAnd allow you ultimately to enjoy the retirement you've always hope for and that's our goal that is why we offer are five step retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation to take advantage call right now at age ... three\nNine retire we have had a lot of interest recently saw a calendar is nearly full but we specifically set aside a few spots for listeners of today's show so call now eight oh three nine retire and mentioned the savior retirement radio show if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now at age do three nine retire\nThat number again that had just share to heal eight oh three nine retire or a oh three\nNine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nRetire with pat dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more thanks for staying with us here today and said the retirements with pasture be pat as we talk about the different next he might have in your portfolio what you're trying to do is make sure your portfolio is not going to move\nAll and the same direction and when you have it set up that way\nIt probably won't capture the highest of high rise\nBut it also shouldn't hit the lowest of loads re\nThat's perfectly said Gen if you think about maybe at any point in your life have you had all of your investments in the stock market you know if you have a great run it in the market over a year or two you might be a mix thirty or forty or fifty percent on your money which is of course incredibly exciting but we've all experienced two thousand eight and if you've been investing long enough two thousand two thousand one\nWhere the market within a year or two dropped in half\nSo you can make as much as the person or lose as much as ... percent\nAnd maybe that's okay if you've got a couple of thousand dollars in a stock you're playing around with\nBut it's a whole another story if you've taken your whole life savings and have it there\nSo all we're doing is if you can picture me kind of with my hands real high for the higher returning low fat low return just trying to squeezed those hands closer together\nAnd narrow that range and of course we'd love to have as much of that up so we can and we want to eliminate that risk on the downside as much as we can\nAnd of course you have to understand there is no such thing as an investment that has a really high returned with no risk that just doesn't exist of what we're trying to do is use all the tools available\nTo help you narrow down that range and that's where we believe our expertise lives because we are not investing for thirty year olds for high growth we are investing for people that are in their last five ten Fifteen Years before our time and then throughout retirement\nAnd if we can generate a nice income stream off of that portfolio have the potential for some growth and reduce your risk as much as possible that is what most people are excited about when they're coming in and talking with us\nThat when we talk about having the right next to the assets for us send our unique situation if we aren't sure if that's what we truly has is it a good idea to get a second opinion from someone like you\nWell I think they can be a tremendous value Gen and of course you want to make sure\nYou're getting a second opinion that is not gonna apply pressure to you we truly mean that our processes zero cost and zero expectation on our end because it's just an opportunity for us to get together with you and get to know you and we certainly are not the perfect planning for for every single person\nAnd we're certainly not big enough to be able to work with every person so we're trying to find people that were a great fit with and we know that's what you're trying to do as well\nSo whether you are handling your finances yourself\nOr you're working with some type of financial professional we just see tremendous value and getting a second opinion because if you're on the right track isn't it nice to hear from someone else yes we run the numbers and you're doing really well and if there's something off\nThan you certainly would want to know and then the third possibility as young as it's a different philosophy and I love to talk with people about that and I say you know if you're doing something that's working okay right now\nAnd I say if you're interested in seeing what our philosophy would look like I said the one thing that I can tell you that I think you'll have tremendous peace of mind about is nothing we're gonna come back and show you is going to look exactly like what you have\nSo we're not going to say oh we're slightly better this or that we're gonna show you something completely different because most financial firms are designed more for growth their design more for someone in their thirties maybe in their forties and what we're doing something completely different\nA retirement plan to take you from\nThe five ten years before retirement into in through retirement and so it's going to look very different and that doesn't mean it's right for you but it should make that decision easier for you to look and say okay I see where pass from is coming from that maybe I don't agree with that maybe I Want to have high growth for further\nInto my life into retirement or maybe I'm not concerned about those five different areas retirement I just want to have a portfolio is going to generate as much returned as it possibly can and so that's the beauty of the process is getting a second opinion\nFrom a retirement specialist really can help you see ultimately coming back to your question Jim hey are we on track\nAnd is our allocations set up appropriately for us in that ties into a number of things first of all how old are you how far off from retirement are you how much of your income do you need to generate off of your portfolio and then we also need to talk through all those things that are really individual to use such as\nYour personality your comfort with riskier desire for growth\nYou know what does that retirement gonna look like is it more of a jet setting traveled the world type of retirement or is it more of a home body stay home type of scenario\nAnd that's really important to make sure it's personalized for all of those types of things that's why we offer are five step retirement review with absolutely no cost and no obligation because it gives you the opportunity to talk to someone who is a specialist in the retirement area\nAnd give you a customized assessment to help you review and help you see are you on track\nFor when you want to retire in to accomplish the goals in life so you're trying to accomplish in retirement\nAnti also put your nest egg through a portfolio stress tests to help you see if you're taking the amount of risk that you believe you're taking and ultimately help you try to match up your retirement income to support those goals that we talked about earlier to get started costs now at age ...
