New York about thirty miles west of Albany the state capital Chris Fiore is with the New York state police\nInvestigation at the scene revealed that the two thousand one Ford expert excursion limousine was traveling southwestern state route thirty and failed to stop at the intersection with state route thirty a\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boy she said she said she was in her late teens\nAnd she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then we find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica she went to Hawaii she went to ah\nThe south Pacific Island she went to a French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh she had no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nThat she uh the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause it came out that they want it to second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that\nShe also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kevin all thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves and crooks and miscreants every every description the second accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supported her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Lebanon Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from\nA weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken stayed to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence\nAnd simply parrot it public statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American costs\nJust as quote unquote so said a Senator Susan Collins\nAnd that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin all\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on ... it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a son this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kavanaugh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project in others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence destroyed or goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford that completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports\nShe could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show as a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial do miss aerial do much to say writer on Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others\nTo make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable ... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nStephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media pedaling in lives in irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats and some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night you can put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job\nSo let's continue with more of your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later is that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum talking from a woman's mothers perspective\nI have a sense that cabin always going to be a conservative maybe about along the lines of an Anthony Kennedy\nBecause that's just what is your one when Susan Collins one Saturday yesterday and spent all that time at three o'clock running over his opinions and looked at me like a pretty moderate Republican why was selected I'm not sure\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated opponent by the Senate by the mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore north teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false\nIt's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nThat were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door in our house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend none of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out\nIn an affidavit to the Senate how many times that professor forward lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett a judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen must continue wearing their calls recalls from Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour

am you give it to\nInvest in better futures UNC a visit you in Sierra dot org slash invest a mind is a terrible thing to waste a wonderful thing to invest in a public service announcement brought to you by us yesterday\nTo be the key voices the United States Senate I didn't think I'd ever only\nHandle the truth\nSo for us and say real\nB. O. C. received as a my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant going over for forty five minutes while she was going to support then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not\nStand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad is girls\nAnd what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination to witness confronting your accuser is all that kind of stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything forward said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now clowns fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure\nYeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but uh over the years or one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry it I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why do they take money from these people who would split women that way\nFounder Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky for him Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and that open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nDuring a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies and subjugated women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate and Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because uh you know the older the fact of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with ... probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party who were the eyewitnesses\nTell me again about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said in twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties\nBrett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fear that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli you're left foot\nBecause you weren't treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist and twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said in twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely\nLearn more about the W.

children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed\nAre believed in other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and one hundred percent acceptance on the other\nThe fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do as a criminal defense attorney a take off my ad and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar Raj or victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process determined to but she was saying was actor now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and said she was a thief\nInstead of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says you say if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or a lie\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and a one and not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist\nWant it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do with Koester phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe\nShe had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursue were not with you on that she said\nShe is mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like

people get checked somewhere\nAnd I'm not talking about suppression of votes so I'm not talking about the limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about them actually getting control without any facts to\nSubordinate their their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and regret of loopholes in this day and twenty Eighteen cannot with at the ballot box the court they can't one of the courts they go to the streets if the cat went in the streets but next thing has bloody revolution\n... years yet before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for New York or newspapers has a ...\nIt column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue let's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller because Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think there are people like Brian saw\nOn only dishonest they are downright evil they will do that nothing to get a power\nNumber two the Democrats look socialists progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change or whether it be the lives that that Dr forward presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about the second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about or late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid nineties eighties Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin all in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by route\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that route political force is the only way that we are going to come and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beating them at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote it down or if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts here there and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you walk that fight\nReally didn't get a venue today to hear\nEric Holder who still contempt of Congress you say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo you recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought accord sailor was going to win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means\nHe's talking down in American democracy and I'm appalled that someone who's the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never conceded the election she never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thanks for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSimon and his book code red about a ... vote and Russia encouraged in America in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is\nA bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama than citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China consignment would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms in the machine and the companies that I made a fair for the next ... only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine has program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nThe machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the terms who's on the ballot what have you know and the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm\nOr like a wave votes from Republican to add to the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ... he was on three hours and it was really a riveting and it's been happening for a decade\nLibel I Believe

done to others they try to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to break capital they will try and do to us if they can\nThe second thing is is that all we're mind this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten\nOf these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties [laughter]\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within it I don't think we see that but I think if we do\nIt will provide a great context for

the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those positive way she'll be all new again let me\nTell you this thought Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator wanted the church undermined
