{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "From many view that are listening tonight you or your loved ones may be receiving the new Medicare cards that are coming in the mail you may have already gotten them so what do you need to do with these cards especially when it comes to all the things that are coming up with health care at the end of the year\nDr Lisa McAdams is with us tonight she's the acting regional administrator for the southwest region office\nOf the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services Lisa for people to get these new courage what do they need to know about them and why did they get them well\nThank you for having me ban and um the new cards were developed in order to better protect the security to prevent identity theft for people with Medicare\nAnd for people when they get this card what do they need to know about it do they have to authorize it like a new credit card can they start using it right away to they have to wait till next year\nThe new cards in Texas for four million then I'm Medicare patients here\nUm or being a mailed a to the uh people with Medicare um they don't have to do anything to get the the new card there's no cost for the new card 'em and they should see that in their mail sometime before the end of October\nAnd what if you're listening and I haven't received your card yet what do you need to do\nOr if they haven't gotten their car by the end of October they should call our one eight hundred Medicare number or they can go to Medicare dot Gov a and look to see what the status says\nI'm there should be plenty of information or on the Medicare a wine a counselor available to help them to identify what the issue is\nUm most of the time if they haven't received their card\nUh it it will be because the um the mailing address it they have register with Social Security is not correct um and so if they want to double check and make sure that that addresses correct even now they can call Social Security to make sure that the numbers are correct\nAnd for people they always ask like how long do I keep my old car card what should I Do with it\nThey should destroy the old card as soon as they received the new cards I when I say destroy I'm mean totally destroyed they shouldn't put it in the recycle ban they shouldn't throw it in the trash they should try that cut it up into little pieces\nSome way to destroy it so that the um Medicare number on there can no longer be seen\nAnd laughing for people that want to find out more information where can they get all the info that you talked about tonight\nThey can uh go to one eight hundred Medicare as I mentioned um we have a counselors available there to help them uh uh\nFind out a answer any of the questions that they may have a or they can go to Medicare dot Gov I and we have a lot of information about the new cards there as well and Medicare dot Gov\nI appreciate your time thank you Lisa for coming on we'll take a quick break it's been for some show a lot more coming up\nWe're listening to the ... on the icon radio network so I just discovered\nJoined us [noise] weird shedding I'm about Kanye West's the Democratic party and how they are treating\nUm\n\nDemocrats to disagree with him\nCounty west has been turned into a bipolar ignorant white man who doesn't read by the Democratic party because he sat down with Donald Trump just think about how messed up that is thinking about how jacked up that is\n\nThinking about how insane that is\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to what's good to your phone calls on this see what you think about it uh let me go to Beth thanks for wedding you're on the ... show Hi Beth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi ban that that was saying earlier I'm a conservative from South Carolina\nI never quite he's always been a nice guy he never did it in any negative behavior that on that work with him but I Would just like to apologize to Kanye West or\nThe kite sellers comment and that just really disappointed me and I'm just very disappointed that embarrassed by the ... on that and I like to fight the part that it kind of have less ah\nPut a comment is because um I ...\nThat was totally unnecessary particularly\nI Know I'm ... made a comment about mental health but that was that was extremely sensitive and I would like to ask you I mean it's very frustrating because\nThey're sitting here and then President Trump a such a difficult time and when he got glasses second I really liked that pre shake the comment on your previous caller\nA scot who made the comment earlier I really liked the comment that he said he refers to himself as an American ... and I really like that\nBut I Want to ask you what do you think about\nYou know not the water and everyone and Hillary inciting violence about the ... president ... why didn't anybody do anything to Marie Marie ... dollar the state Senate or on the dirty a year or so that he said he should be that the night and\nIt's it's because it's a double standard it's it's the if a Republican says anything\nThat is you know semi negative about anybody they the media report on it and then force you into a corner and then say you should resign your office\nFind someone that says you should resign your office find someone that says you should be in you know impeached or or kicked out of office and they will put the the the pressure cooker on you whereas the Democrat does it if a democratic does it does it they just they look the other way because they say well\nThis person's too valuable it's like the whole Spartacus moment is a great example okay\nRemember when Cory Booker had his whole fake Spartacus moment where he said yeah you know you can kick me out of the Senate and I may be kicked out of the Senate for doing this but I don't care and everything that he was doing was all a joke and a show everything that he was a saying he was exposing had already\nBeen agreed upon was public knowledge and could be released to the public\nYou know if a Republican would have done that stunt lord have mercy I cannot imagine\nHow what the reaction would have been the reaction would have been just scolding in ridicule it would've been the open of Saturday Night live it didn't none of those things happen to Cory Booker because Cory bookers and African ...\nAmerican Democrat and they protect their own\nWell again I Know I just want to call it died in ... and say that\nYou know a ... not only in my opinion embarrasses up embarrassed our state of South Carolina it can you know that's not what South Carolina ... ... residents represent wait uh we all had her at what the call right\nWell and and work I've done a lot of TV because I was shocked when he said this I think he's better than that I just couldn't believe it that that's the that's the road you would take and it was sad\nIt's really sad real quick one remind your night and I I didn't talk about this as much as they normally do but it's important if you have not joint the conservative alternative to A. R. P.\nCalled a Mac now is the time to do it we're at one point four million or conservatives who were fighting side by side standing together to fight back in Washington against the liberal A. R. P. A. R. P. has taken a multi million dollar ad campaigns for the midterm elections\nYeah twenty thousand people standing in a grass field uncovered for four hours for a chance to listen to the president\nSo uh I was oh shut off to the side and I waited there about a half an hour forty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well\nThank you so I walked hair walk back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you I said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo he came up with some nice days he says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said this to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you are going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat\nWhat you're doing is that is fabulous away exchange some more niceties small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go so I handed him my Mike and I took a Mike and I talk to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about a cause show gay talked about South Korea whenever the issue is Kevin ... whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview in about a twenty twenty five minutes at the bottom\nAnd then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous in diamond in silk reminded me\nHit him on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal part isn't\nVoting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal partisan group for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially every American women some as diamonds silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBut Cory sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's a coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye in the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro\nOf the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they've had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't have got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble\nSaid that he's irrational on a madman snoop doggy dog a doggy citizen Uncle Tom and so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jesse ... Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in Congolese arise in others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed school choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations\nThey've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs\nAnd champion Bill Clinton's crow after policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats or crippled a black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said and the sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous Lee and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would it be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such clean and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and asked\nTo the civil war ended conducted by Democrats slave\nOwners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate\nMurder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because his sample shouldn't\nMedia like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control\nWay of what I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party and so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming he's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter\nOf black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party and he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West\nIs the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West\nAnd and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore\nChicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm\nCan you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nCheck out we would max north Americans who are

coming in how important was that they get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious later and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back to Iowa we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President

heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her and

one of the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do not caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just extra car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my ear we talked about Canada Mexico we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nBut we had it in ... Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand it already and it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three\nWe got the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis lower and that Nineteen sixty eight yeah I Know you're a good old I've got three more weeks

thought was ridiculous about our hat\nAnd a jacket that she wore and a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I don't recall with\nAll these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration gimme fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but it can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by governor or a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative what if CBS would say from top to bottom organ or is that what we're going to reflect conservative values\nAnd cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC and NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox into a mirror leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up\nFor any hope for NBC those ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening\nNewscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you got to do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue\nWith calls from California Texas North Carolina Louisiana and no Ohio I Belong becomes available number to call his eight six

woman's got to figure it out or why get more blacks figure out what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them\nTo say I don't know what I wanted to say it again or why in the ... August ... Beauchamp I caught it all the time and the vote was being held to free slaves why Democrat voted to free the slaves that rate how can I mean the way\nWhat the Democrats on this lady and Democrats owned the slaves and the Republicans tried to free them\nAnd then after the war the Democrats Lynch blacks and the Republicans try to save them and now here we are in twenty Eighteen the Democratic party has destroyed African Americans and the Republicans like Don drunk Donald Trump is saving them but but but the media doesn't cover ... why do they\nKnow they don't and I'm very upset because July ... date with this year I went to the doctor who has cable and I heard a report on man an alien and are at a\n... a woman in front of her Thirteen butter on dragged her into the woods and that and killed her and I would not report that on the news you know that was a black cat that was how do we ... that are killing them they are in our country\nAnd there is no group hurt more by illegal aliens than African American workers\nBut to CNN's Don limits in this world doesn't cover it that way because they're the mouthpiece for the modern Democratic Party\nThere is no grew more hurt by illegal alien migration into America than African Americans they're the ones hurt most by and poor white folk poor white for her you know most poor people in America are white and poor white folks are hurt by two and they tend to vote disproportionally for Democrats it's unbelievable\nNot their fight girl but anyway you know\nI hated Obama I'd still hate and he's wicked any evil will turn the turn of than a third world country up there that old ... Conn Shaw we get will never had a president in the country that only can we calm Seventy or\nNot to try the following president or president say wow I Can't ... stop\nWell you know Patsy uh some are concerned that Obama and Clinton are back out campaign\nYou might recall that Obama said my name's on the ballot this is my third term Hillary's going to continue my policies and there were so roundly unpopular that as soon as the American people living in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Iowa Florida Texas\nHurt Obama's say vote for Hillary we've got four more years of my policies\nThat's what caused working class folks in these so called swing states to come out one hundred percent against Obama and against Hillary Clinton because as soon as they discovered you know what am I vote for Hillary I got four more years of Obama maniacs I Can't take it\nHeld that is why Trump was elected\nAnd so of Hillary and uh in Obama and Michelle whoever wants to go out and keep campaigning I say go

know ... how to Maxine Waters make like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nShe's been in office like twenty eight years she lives in a four point three million dollar house\nNever takes responsibility for the consequences\nOf her policies as you may know the worst place in America deliver an African American isn't a black congressional district because there is never economic development is never educational achievement there's no never family formation so you're like a black lady when you look at Maxine Waters and others by peddling this crap\nWhat has so many blocks by it\nWell let me first tell you why they have it because that will call get a pack kick back Patty wet gave her dog up on that dog was given a big bomb living in a four point three million dollar home on a one hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars a year salary\nMet the water to not even live in a district that she represents and there are so many black people that don't even know that that's why they want to keep your mind up close and keep you in a box that they can keep them by it and ... ... that's why they keep\nThrowing racism and race baiting to people\nSo that you can stay divided and you're not really know what's going on you said it met the water had been in position for twenty seven ... years and have did absolutely nothing to help her own district so detrimental you have people living in\nTents no running water and it's a shame and she don't even recognize her own district and black people it's time for them to wake up and smell the coffee we look at who's representing you you wonder what he didn't want to say that the white man that's keeping you down no issue all black\nFellow so called leaders that keeping you stuck\nIn a rock looking really messed\nIn fact a dime and look at it this way eight of the last ten years\nBrock Hussein Obama was in charge of the American presidents in for part of the time Democrats control everything in fact Democrats controlled the states California Washington Oregon New York Massachusetts practically every major city like Chicago Illinois controlled by liberal Democrats for like Seventy five years\nSo this status of African Americans as not significantly improved on the Southside of Chicago\nHow is it possible they can keep casting a drip their own responsibilities and blame the evil white man or blame Donald Trump\nAnd when you can't find a Republican with a surge warnings you go girl annoy diamond how did they get away with that\nCourt and not getting away with it because people are shaken a walk and people are paying attention to trial right well we're not coup fade Bob I watch\nThe president for eight years and they have the\nPower but what they did what they had to put them he gave them an Obama patch on the head and tells you to have a coconut smile and I said I've been at the top ... never come back and he would\nHe was ... and ... what the puppet masters\nPull the strings attached to any one he's working for the American people I don't think they're quite getting away with it that they are but people people minorities have again American people are waking up in the in the Democratic party they are\nStill going to do this way I mean you'd have to think now for the eight years the Bronx Hussein Obama was in office when Eric Holder and ... and all the ... they had to work like crazy on behalf of black smoke\nAnd I want you to compare silk the achievement of African Americans under Obama compared the two years of drug use the difference\nThere there is no comparison when it comes down to ... Iraq Hussein Obama they said that he was the first black or African American president though he was he was biracial and his black side did nothing for black both\nPeople want to talk about the justice system the black president did nothing for the black community it was a white president President Donald Trump the one that they want to walk around car races that doing more for black people than the rock Hussein Obama you have\nPresident Donald Trump who's looking out for people back interest\nMaking sure that they have job so that they can provide\nFor their families and looking out the people that have been and justly wrong\nAnd they're going to prosecute the president what message diamond do you give to African Americans all across this great country\n[laughter] [laughter] what can I watch [laughter] what we call the Democratic\nAnd silicon on Monday a October Fifteen the dummy crowds and I I have a website here I can send people to fathom events website to see where the tri state we're in the nation the this movie's gonna be but I Hope it's a great success Phil Ewing diamond have gone prime time on me your prime time\nCertainly how you want to make sure you go to Donny cracked the movie dot com they get your ticket Ghani cracked the movie that kind of get your ticket ...

black entertainers that'll leave the Democratic plantation that does not bode well for the future of the Democratic party there's no question no one can question the fact\nThat uh if the Democratic party did not have African Americans voting like Ninety to Ninety five percent for them\nThen they would be without any question more minority part and they are today the same phrases really use of course you can just you lead Peters in many others\nBut what what's going on with diamond in silk and what's gonna happen with Kanye West and happened already\nIs that you have to keep them with a democratic plantation so when but courage seller said on CNN Tuesday night quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with them and take pictures unquote\nCar sellers is a paid contributor to CNN is an African American speaking to Don Lemon another African American buddy said Kanye West is illiterate and he can't read can't think\nAnd uh another CNN contributor Tara said Meyer went on to say quote black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote how in the world\nDoes CNN allow judge such filth on its air when you have black liberal commentators saying that a fellow black person is illiterate and is a a whore and is a quote token negro and getting away with it\nOr he or she went on to say quote no one should be taken ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized in other words he's mentally ill and during all this time Don Lemon the CNN host\nVenomous league lead smile and laugh during the entire time I could not imagine what would have happened with Don Lemon\nIf white conservative Republicans and said about a African American quote he's a house negro he's mentally ill and it continued with Jimmy Kimble\nWho said Kanye West is irrational on a madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat cities Uncle Tom he's dangerous is an independent person who's thinking independently and that is something CNN\nWhich is a mouthpiece for the Democratic party cannot put up with if more and more African Americans think independently\nThen they're going to realize what the Democratic Party has done to them historically and what

Can't watch Joe Scarborough I Can't do it but I I read transcripts Drudge Report Bill O'Reilly dot com whatever it is I'm looking at ... dot com Daily Caller\nAnd I look at what's going on in these shows and I'm thinking what world do I live in because there is an evolution in America today that's not being addressed do\nWhen I Would ask you how is it possible that you get a butchers and bakers in candlestick makers and electricians and bloomers Don black uniforms put on ... and then march to their death anywhere between six and ten million Jews Catholics homosexual and kill forty to fifty million people crushing skulls and\n... babies that these are average German that did this\nThere had to be something going on mentally with them it was like a mental illness in Germany between thirty two and I did\nWas acceptable bill that was acceptable\nThat's what happened and that's why after the war\nAnd to to use like the red cross the American CIA the Vatican help some of these people get away get outta Germany and go to South America or Spain or South Africa because it was acceptable but just as America today\nIs acceptable to millions of citizens to Raj an allegation\nWithout any cooperation zero and destroy a man his two daughters and his wife\nYou know it's kind of ... and the ball is kinda worse than cooperation it's instant refuting the witnesses actually didn't cooperate but I mean they are included into\nThe weeds on it because I don't know what happened you know I don't know what happened and I haven't criticized for it and I I didn't make any pronouncements about guilt or innocence but the undeniable fact\nIs that it was acceptable in many American minds to kill this sky Kavanaugh to destroy him know and that's what you saw in Germany now it's not the same thing obviously you know\nAll right and and you know when I make these points to the media matters and these are the propaganda outfits which would have been great on the jurors Joseph ... okay they are I call them and not say I know I'm not\nBut your question was a good one how could it happen that ordinary Germans and in the United states German Americans are the largest ethnicity okay how can that happen that these people would do with these high end these things because\nIt was acceptable thing I mean and that's what\nWe're seeing in America now we're seeing a rise horrible behavior that is acceptable\nWell there was a Minnesota schoolteacher and moan Monday or Tuesday\nThat put out a tweet about someone needs to someone needs to kill ... I mean you talk about actual\nKilling someone needs to kill Kevin Oh a Minnesota Public school teacher put out a tweet Monday that someone needs to take one for the team quote in kill cabin all yeah and I'm I'm reading this and I\nAnd there was no perimeter stations the mainstream media your book points out ... on page thirty nine Nineteen forty seven alone an estimated eight thousand members of the ss safely traveled a candidate in the United states utilizing fools document\nAnd that ... and that their claws Barbie one of the worst the worst in France was actually pay the pension by our own CIA so explain to the twenty Eighteen mind how does the United states government the red cross and the Vatican since\nThese mass murders to go free and how do we take our tax money and pay someone like horsepower me like Seventeen hundred dollars a month how do we do that\n[noise] you know it's again people who don't\nConfront evil one of the great stories in the book is a woman named Alfred E. H. E. T. H.\nAs a young woman she was a seamstress alright World War two broke out and they'll ... signs up for the lady S. S. core she\nIs assigned a ravens ... concentration camp north of Berlin which was a women's concentration camp Jewish women a gypsy women uh dissidents that kind of thing and al ... a German Shepherd and terrorize these women for four years what happened to her\nShe came to the United states on a refugee ... but you know nobody knew that she was an ss car I moved to San Francisco marries a Jew\nStays in San Francisco for almost fifty years before the state department tracked her down and the portrait of Germany she still alive in Germany getting every month us Social Security\nCheck it's impossible it's impossible that happens because people don't engage\nThey don't fight it they don't bring it to the attention\nOf people that might matter and you know if you ... Trump situation uh once he was elected all the rules in the media changed says you know I no longer was the truth and poor did was get him\nBecause we don't like him so all of our resources are going to be directed to getting him well the progressive movement is capitalized on that has exploited that\nAnd has walked into precincts where they got me yeah the same people said accused me accused Kavanaugh same tax sure right same crew\nBut no Americans are they don't know what's happening or if they do they're looking away the Kobe or lose one view or no because of that no I don't think so no\nIn something happening now you know you have ... his show I guess is in Saudi Arabia and dissident who uh who said nasty things in ... is a contributor to the Washington Post but a ... is a Saudi Arabian citizen seemingly he is killed in Turkey which shouldn't happen\nCharacter the other day in the White House it was fun to watch for ten minutes but then Don lemons that it was a minstrel show that you have a young African Americans on CNN that cold in the house negro every race alchemy palm yeah Uncle Tom and I mean I remember\n... works the rope line are private time together our discussion ... was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd then you're going to find a very good because you're ... you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think our tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm an air don't interview and in a few minutes and the president also an extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm most appreciative and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my\nFriend Sean Compton [noise] and then also their friendship with the president [noise] uh I'm not sure he would have invited me to [noise] to meet with him on friday night and a couple of nights ago and I also taught you asked me what I thought how I thought he was doing\n[noise]\n\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you've alone that was right for\nCall them but we could start\nFirst of all\nYou have a long distance relationship here I Do I ...\nI had swift in with my father a long time ago and we we did a good job we fix it up we uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick if I ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there are no\nAnd knocked down about six months ago all really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage can sure everything's on what's going to happen with the mega housing development\nOh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen sending\nUs to talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is he's a great religious later and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just eat literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted her back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy right now\nAbout your wife is good she had to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense just not a question of it it's just such a human basis they needed and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had\nA big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refuse to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nAre so many jobs you're talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\n... you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nTo make a big deal of if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up
