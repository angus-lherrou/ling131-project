questions it never hurts to get this information and write it down\nAnd that way you can sleep at night knowing that you got the right plan for you but I I Would tell you there are four or five things that I Would help people recommend them to to ask\nWhen they do their homework one first and foremost is the premium second the network are providers it's important to check and make sure that your primary care you specialist and even maybe your preferred hospital is in the network or the third thing would be the cost sharing the co pays right so it's important to ask questions about\nYou know what if I go to the doctor I go to my primary care four times a year and fiber each time at twenty bucks are going to make sure I'm including in my budget I'm divorced thing would be\nOn the extras right extra benefits that you get with Medicare Advantage and what I mean by extras are\nLike dental and vision hearing benefits and over the counter drug benefit and then you know than the last thing

more coming up in Ferguson show right after this\n... show on the icon radio network more of your phone calls and thoughts on Facebook ... click the like button coming up after the listen up football fans\nFerguson show so nice to have you with us this afternoon and our this evening depending on where you are around the country\nOf the political caravan Democrats clearly wants to use this\nCaravan of illegal immigrants coming to the U.S now and almost ten thousand stronger\nGet here close as they possibly can to election day have America or have to stand up for itself and then they'll use it against the president saying this is the Republican Party this is how inhumane they are they're going to support the children they are going to split the mothers\nThey're going to exploit anybody they possibly can export\nThey're going to do what ever they can to support them so they can use their hardships for their own political reasons let's\nGo to your phone calls on this see what you think about it one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to uh let me go to George thinks are wedding you're on the bench Ferguson show go ahead\n[noise] yes hardest thing I like to say is that President Trump is doing the right thing\nI Am the price and that came over in the Nineteen fifties from New York and they should stop all of this immigration nonsense and go back to the a\nPlan they hatch in the fifties\nYou had to have a sponsor first of all\nAnd that sponsor usually gave you a job for you to endanger will be on your own in the country and get another job is saying is if something when Wallace you\n... for you in other words that was no such thing is going on welfare and that's one of the big problems\nHere and what happens is if the sponsor didn't want to do anything you went back to the country you came from and that's the way it should be\nSee I I agree with you because it used to be accountability there now it's well I don't want to have to deal with any of the accountability the government or at the Democratic party has in essence become the sponsor\nThat's correct and and and so they say there is no there is no one to show you the ropes there is no one to get you connect to the community\nThere is no one there to hold you accountable to work your tail off there's no one there for any of that because now it's just getting this country will give you a free health care will give your kids free schooling will do everything you want for free\nYeah it's all political and it just\nBasically getting bogus for the Democrat that's the only thing they have left\nEverything out as a failure to look at any city if the Democrats have a clip your sixty is and you can follow that city called bankruptcy people are moving out of those places and into places that have a bed at tech schools\nI mean this is a big big calm and if you use to avoiding invasion that is that correct word to use Shia\nOkay because they were in the past ... you know this goes back to Alaska gene a day but appetizing full page ads\nIn Hong city says south a lot of their main cities and basically telling all these things that the United states for them to get it in the\nShallow any tax payer out there that he is this what they believe that the whole thing should be on the tax payers broaden that had jobs here and that this abuse ... distribution of money should be up to the governments\nWho was your sponsor when you when you came through I mean was it a family friend how did that work\nThis was the Catholic Church\nAnd they and did they do more than just sponsored a mentor you did they get you connect in the community what all did they do\nYeah they uh they did that and they provided a depression job and you had to work there for about a year to two years and then if you had something better going ah you know job wise you can't go and get that job it was it's a simple\nSystem but it's a you know it's up to you you don't want to crush peoples and ... and that's when they come here and the only ambition that most of those people have is to go on welfare that's the only in Sumpter yeah at me as a human being\nAnd as you just put it don't go on welfare don't have a backup plan amen to that great point and I appreciate the phone call will continue this conversation right now on Facebook and on Twitter ... show on Twitter you can follow me there on Twitter and hit the like\nButton on Facebook will continue the conversation there right now in the meantime have a

your perfect local employee Columbia ... dot com local job that work Columbia hope on the dot com present the world's worst books so wonderful job don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date [noise]\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn off for them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard the go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals\nFrom the most violent place on Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is\nTelling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico\nThere's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they won't permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there was a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins illegal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled to have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of\nMillions who not been heard yet and so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to herring that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused\nBy unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest\nThere is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration\n... there's no coverage doesn't exist the murders the rapes and cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party I sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy\nRight now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers are not just the ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have where only four percent of the world's population\nBut every year legally through ... says he's we take in legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch for\n... of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen\nThis is fundamentally changed our country that is far and it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go\nOr other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that's the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nThe November sixth on MSNBC\nGetting an underground utility line is no joke voice serious injury inconvenient

nonetheless let's continue with your calls let's go to a fill in Connecticut an ad in Las Vegas in Philly Connecticut Welcome to the bill Cunningham show and Phil how are you\nMr Cunningham how are you a comeback Mr Phil I'm doing well please go ahead\nWell here's the thing it Connecticut boom and he's been required the cabin out here in ...\nI Know for a fact he's working on this caravan with a lot of other Democrats across the country\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand of voice of the border you know by the time string fan\nThan Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves you use that real army and I think the plant is they want to get like another came straight kinds of ours and we got our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told oh don't worry dormant like stormed the Mexican border a few days ago I Would put in a a token effort to hold them twenty four hour ensure the U.S and share it with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico are true at all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be told stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're oh it's but the media to mediate here this is all coordinate\nOffended by ... you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty I did this play well with residents to Connecticut\nBecause when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe no one will will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together and it's legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming from the most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant there's tens of thousands or the mayor thanks that Governor Malloy ... over the past year and a half the Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ISIS about that the court room they hold up her shirt\nDick Blumenthal shows up at the true for other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually the ice or suspended their case should help her future here he's in front of the TV cameras all all the time trying to see the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and getting caught you send back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America and you said the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing you get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing\nThen you released back into America and the most you can be held his fourteen days there's not we're not able to handle this invasion for the most violent places on earth Central American we're not able to do it\nContinue with added no Las Vegas Nevada and ... and welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI and the U.S national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current uh current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also how can Obama drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill and blow 'em up you know ... and then the media doesn't see any no doubt that they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know ... ... ... it's in the\nView of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it\nBut ... out of wacky being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by that a legal immigrant or not was quickly dropped she's gone a composite or killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact that ... that kind of behavior not part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much but I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly\nWith Saudi Arabia and he went to her Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists and then I hear about can show again is if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is his wife more valuable than a cubs life\nNPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past ... who's back to stand in the oil as political opponents ...\nPortion Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed the face their supply Afghanistan\nPlus services African Business conference that Obama held for fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery\nOf human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just fall under over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this desk fought\nFor tourists African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nAnd and you went over that quickly but used Pakistan had a leader\nWho would boil alive is political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replacing footing around with this

tens of thousands a month coming into America we don't have the money it doesn't work what needs to happen is the federal law needs to be changed with\nThe cooperation of the Democratic party that says when you arrived here illegally you're mainly said that your country of origin without a hearing\nThat's it no due process because you're not an American but Democrats\nTend Democrats in the Senate will not allow that to happen they will not allow got change Trump wanted to get those so called dreamers might be twenty million dreamers don't know how many citizenship on the path to an exchange with a border wall to stop it but it can put a cork in a bottle\nBut Democrats wouldn't agree Democrats right now we're not agree they'd rather destroy the country and get political power

getting up at night to go this is not okay listen\nOkay anyway um yeah my comment is that I think\nThere is something beyond the deep state a deeper steak beyond a shadow government probably the dark shadows\nI don't know what it is is it the one world government is a builder burgers or the wrong child or or whoever\nYou know on that point in about an hour and twenty minutes I'm gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state how\nThat continues it continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop it he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that uh it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might Iran agreed\nWith I Would agree with that completely and I I Want to tell you you know the ... the people that protested against a governor governor I mean cuts capital right they were led by the Democratic party for a specific reason they don't want constitutional judges on the Supreme\nCourt oh no they don't\n... they want a super legislature they they won judges to impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed through the Democratic process\nAnd so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got course itching Kevin ... who ... oh I Hope become constitutional judges they're going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens Sam abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to services second legislature and I hope that's not Kevin Al Gore stage and Roberts and Alito and and not Thomas I I Hope that's what\nThat's what they do in the future is don't come to us to impose new rules on the American people go to the legislature go to the Congress go to the states go to the cities go to the counties that's where it belongs\n[laughter] you know the Democratic party bill ... social in a ... a sure experiment in green over your as my state of

immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight much stimuli goal hell's breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is the vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks and two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress and I say oh contrary mon prayer I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three

more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin ... near the blacks fear\nTo talk about why he was like oh by Fox and the impact in the black community of illegal immigration then at the bottom of the last hour we're going to have on a report from Peter Wallison is

I was thinking Steve twenty thirty seven with just been for himself well All right but don't expect to be going into a gravity boots\nYou want to have money in your future he got his start saving now putting some money from every paycheck and killing and that will come again to the bill Cunningham so Corey how are you I'm doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president the privately it was wonderful you spent like hundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh\nThere there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is before we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff the idea of the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I've spent so much time with a then candidate Trump and now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely uh magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family\nIs doing and what he can do to help me that just who he is and if you listen to the media they tell you he's the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is\nHe's exceptionally gracious I've seen in so many times helping people that never get the story told because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help when every cat and\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media ... Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad and not the good\nWhere are they only report the bad and miss it ministry under the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about\nI here's a great example just last week I think it was a President Trump did an interview with Lesley Stahl for sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him sixty five times during that interview had to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him four times and they have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad\nNot to give him credit that he deserves for the successes that he said because they no longer in the business of reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nLewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs versus jobs the only difference is the immune to Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because one look at Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong about a trucks that ever Trump sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with pen\nI look at how you're confronted in airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that that that moniker\nThe president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head\nYou know the the calls to violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's a Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break\nYou know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence say antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created I think\nOver for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him now to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally and his acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper than I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex act in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure you might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records not can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad depicted Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the uh the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just getting about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd they asked her I mean do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was no it was appropriate because she was an adult he was the president of the United states leader of the free world\nMonica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump had done that with\nThem to go and vote and they they are bought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to\nMe is our first obligation to the people in this country to make sure they're safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration during jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right he come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and that's how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski lastly there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nIs making a run in twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidates for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run I I Would help her get signatures maybe raised money for\nWould you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty wouldn't you do a great job\nWe love this look in thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's reelection effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\n[laughter] after he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember and when they woke up on a lecture at twenty sixteen the New York times and all of those mainstream media outlets said Hillary Clinton as a Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today nine percent when we get to more than that only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run we want to go\nBack through all of her email scandal all the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was a secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and the fact that she's lost her security clearance political re litigated all let's quarterback in front of the Democratic party\nNo car she'd be a wonderful candidate I mean I could not thinking of any one more qualified to represent the Democratic party than Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a beautiful thing\nWell look if if if if you have my help I think you and I can encourage her to get on the ballot will clear the field I'm a critic Sally this thing called the superdelegates maybe you've heard of the that's how she used\nTo over the last election from Bernie Sanders right well put those back in place shoring system gets like she did it last time and she'll lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority in the house I'm going to say that it's a bow prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham showing my friend will do it

and I think it's pathetic\nAnd the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in the prison at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon sits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back for five decades meanwhile\nA guy who vowed then under the I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told at that one eight abroad rink\nWhen Clinton raped her what what's a bloody lamp told her a roommate what happened the roommates solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the Juanita abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did good to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double than it has to do more with men ...\nMe too movement and trying to to learn how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too is a bunch of left this led truth Hollywood lefty [laughter]\nOkay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on the news and these old school actresses and all these ...

dating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ... on the couch\nAnd then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being\nA bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster\nChild I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms of physicians would somebody\nA Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein had access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions to Democratic Party including the Obamas so they set their own daughters end of the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you don't that you've got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what Rocco bombing selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that led to his left this who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it

she decide I'll take him down for what\nYou know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants coming through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward that\nOffering food water and clothing the coverage of our media indicates that uh they're joining it up against the Trump stir Armenia believes that somehow that this event with tens of thousands\nOf individuals coming from those violent countries on earth\nIs a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is going to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nAnd or the coverage tonight on the nightly news and tomorrow or Monday Tuesday and Wednesday going to be the same going to be terribly negative\nToward Trump's sympathetic toward individuals

the speaker made a comment the expert on the administrative agency slashing the Congress that made the comment that every year and matter who's the president something like three thousand new rules are put into effect by the alphabet soup federal government agencies\nAnd uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different and what the founding fathers intended what the constitution did not intend the consequences had been necessary rules and regulations that cost the American economy billions of dollars every year the\nConstitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThe ... the the agencies and the federal government or the state government agencies but mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect\nAnd then as a consequence we Americans are going to question the legitimacy of their own government when it's completely on accountable a good man Peter Jay Wallace since written a book judicial fortitude\nOr subtitled the last chance to rain and the administrators state and Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the bill Cunningham show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks to go to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got a the fifth conservative vote\nOn the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing in his writings and the second circuit us court of appeals where he was for twelve years Brett Kavanaugh often knock down the administrative state ruled by rule which is a great thing now describe the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAre they administer the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department\nAll the way down to the FCC and their hunger grabbed him and the way that they impact our lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations based on staff who\nIn many cases a generations old and those rules and regulations are not only plentiful that is that there are many of them but they have a major factor in our lives and the purpose of the book that I have written is to explain\nThat we have to rain banned in in some way\nBut whose ... when the when you when you say we have to rain the men who is we\n[noise] uh well the American people have to rain than in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way we do it is through\nThe court system and that's why your point about a ... a Brett Kavanaugh having been a confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth rode the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in\nThe administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats about about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country\nAnd then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for business is of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses career so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars is more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses are from individual each year they very significant thing but it can be turned back\nTown on the couch and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in\nAnd begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nA rules are based on laws that were ... years ago I'm kind of generations ago and they are and perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities issue all these new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule and\nThere are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the national guard it do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nWallison let's go back in time to that\nSummer in Philadelphia and
