house and the judge actually in the in kind of root for them\nIt doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judge his son is going to be Supreme Court nominee there's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory or dad CIA at her grandfather ca and her brother is with a company with a law firm founded

I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kind of look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after or a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForce testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listen to our delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold in the impacted at our life and not have your article author this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist that forward as a credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats church or damn Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have Andrew Nepal a ton of and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho provided witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have a Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman who once the anonymity to testify\nTurned down the opportunity to be questioned in private then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I Try to test her credibility\nMegan bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we ... think Karl Rove yeah you would have completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and then\nI found ... cabinets people even though there was such a notion from both the accused in a man who end up in the court of public opinion in the current day leading up to this quote unquote hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife was\nThe death threats and that his career with looking to be entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine forward and I do believe that something happened to her or she obviously has been in therapy for decades or she had sat herself she has two front\nDoors you know anybody that has to climb doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she has issues now just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh right there it maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start being evidence\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in Kaiser\nWho would have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did in wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what's the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't have the November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court one of his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Law Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because\n... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility short order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable and hearing all this talk about equal rights and gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman not as bad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily Hong Kong and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the world\nAh and also just the holes in our story said thank thank God for Kaine people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham",
