Fort Bragg right now where he's a battalion chapel and and uh just the story of him and his wife\nAnd it's really a intimate view of what our troops go through during a time of deployment\nAnd of course coming back home in the entire reintegration process I Believe it's a story that will really appealed to the to your listeners and you know it's not too often we get to see a a true story like this about a military family in theaters and it's it's just an incredible a story about what our troops sacrifice every day for our freedoms\nYou mentioned that he's still in the military uh how was it to work with the military and and to be able to get his story because I'm sure there was some some hoops to jump through where they excited about this story getting out there\nI guess they were you know it's unlike any other movie that deals with ... because any any other war movie that we're all familiar with like American Sniper Zero Dark thirty or a lone survivor these are movies pretty much the guys have left the military\nOr an incredible veterans that are that are able to tell their story so it was very very challenging because this is really the first time\nThis has happened in a feature film lawyers someone an active duty\nOr if you're still an active duty as having your story sold on the big screen so it was a challenge but now that the film is finished a military families especially are loving the story\nOr because it is a tribute to them and the sacrifices that they make\nYou know this this film or that you're you're talking about um I guess for me as David Evans is the director of this film a lot of times faith based movies have a tough time getting distribution\nYou guys have actually been very successful and being able to have this on a large opening weekend I and that's one thing that's so important for people to see it right away so that stays in those theatres\nAre and make sure that you support this film early on because that allows for so many other people then it can possibly reach\nYou couldn't have said that he'd better be and it's so important on opening weekend to keep a movie like this around for a for for for weeks longer lives important to see an opening weekend you know we want to make a statement but this film that a\nNumber one it's an it's an important film per country you know less than one percent of the population is connected directly to the military today whether it's a a spouse who's serving or a child\nOf sorts that other Ninety nine percent that we want to encourage also to see this movie and uh I I Believe people who see indivisible appreciate it and have some insight and unlike they've never had before into what our\nTroops are facing because it is shot in a very realistic manner using the chaplains own journal that he kept when he was\nServing in Iraq and and the acting is incredible to ban there's nothing a cheesy at whatsoever about this film it's a true story and I'm an incredible cats they're through from Grey's Anatomy and and um and other people from that show and other movies and TV shows Eric Close who had a role in American Sniper\nIs in this movie too so ah folks will will definitely have a

Ferguson show on Twitter you can\nFollow me there and Twitter and hit the like button on Facebook will continue the conversation there right now and the mean time have a fabulous week\nMay share follow us on Twitter been Ferguson show altogether on Facebook as well Ben Ferguson show hit the like button\nAnd you know how to talk I knew\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN two by fours and onto the show for only for Ninety nine to bring thousands of of that\nWith the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers\nAre Jewish how serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first and deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he on friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter of vodka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah\nOrthodox Jew the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions says I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past\nHis neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly and went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews\nWhen Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nSo that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor said Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story\nAbout stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the facts you know Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the ... the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder to many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd a fat doesn't fit and then they don't print it\nIs a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out to restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised for Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence but when\nLargely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and so I'm On the right committing acts of violence\nThat is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply\nHe was referring to those who wanted to keep Confederate monuments now from bill county Amish perspective I\nI don't like the idea of Confederate monuments cause they declared war in my country the United states of America and killed something the range of six hundred thousand Americans by the way those Confederate who did that road Democrats\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight when the president said there's good people on both sides the one son he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nAnd the other side were those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches there's no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your goals root cause in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bottom in the seventh inning of four to one [noise]\nBecause then you tend to use a friend of mine who was left field for the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you\n\n\n[noise] you're better off today than you or two years ago [noise]\nDoes America better off today than it was two years ago as a Foreign Relations better off today than it was two years ago is the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong\nIs the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago\nIn fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong and that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar continue\nRecalls will go right to go to Robert Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call ... thank you write\nThem well yesterday in the middle of the day after the shooting they had Al Sharpton on MSNBC he's again and I am Semitism down and then today on his show there again and again and they said\nWell if friends [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you know\nWell I'm ... how about the riot that Al Sharpton started in New York City are based upon the death of a Jewish person what about ... furniture Mart I mean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nThat's right and and I can I I watched it in St Louis going really a year [noise] here I can\nMake yourself not social ... April ... um [noise]\nWell I Know I just I just Google this\nDecember third the Nineteen Ninety five the river in Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or a ... fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre newly revealed tapes show Sharpton there's not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and goes out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton and started the massacre at Fridays\nFurniture Mart because a Jewish a business owner moved into the black community\nAnd so I I just Google it and how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on its people for this crap\nAnd you know other than the guy who write to the White House and it was All right I think he actually got the cash for being made right\nAnd and Mrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now when they're an indictment now this once in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe\nDidn't have an immediate story herring\nAnd second page go home and and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of a story at All right but I don't know just\nBeing concoction would've actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and say fearful tear filled event and this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nNobody ever and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being real\nOh ... well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything you know you're going to say a word\nWell Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox\nAre sponsored a play in Central Park that depicted the murder through repeated stepping up Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner sponsored a play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nWith a character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now what did the same thing happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nAdded a comedian who rock Obama and held his head to head on\nBut Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nWhy explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies in disparities between the way they treat different acts the same actors committed it kinda depends against too much conducted thank you for your call let's continue we have ray in South Carolina rain South Carolina welcome to the bill Cunningham show re go at\nYour great

academics and hard work the Israeli ambassador to America has said that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to be in anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and the amount of what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies always lecture Trump Republicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric in our violence but when progressive explode\nWhich happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting a trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a share is sending a rice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins or the children are the president whenever that goes on\nAt no point or progressive ever lectured\nBy the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism even when the president is the only one in American history have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh had postings saying how much you hated Trump\nBecause Trump Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN is still twisted this thing and if something's wrong with Trump\nNever mentioned in the hatred the radicalism of the left which exceeds what happens on the right the whole first in Baltimore all the race riots the shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left\nNever any connections river made\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas\nDuring a rally a black lives matter and then meeting in the White House\nWith those same leadership of black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama and the media never said wait a minute Mr Mr President how do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops\nWhat are we went dead cops when he won them now pegs in a blanket fry bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist\nBut Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism one route Republican speak up\nHave you heard about the guy from Utah who sent rice in to the president to kill him\n... have you heard about the white powder the rice and attack\nOn the home of Senator Susan Collins by a leftist after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would have been if Republicans had attacked the children abroad Hussein Obama oh my oh my lord ... the world would end as we know it\nThey are ... too much for me to take\nLet's continue thousands on old millions millions are listening let's go to ... and the great state of Indiana chair and Indiana welcome to the bill Cunningham show Chad go ahead\nAnd that you bought it for other victims of the shooting and yes and I know this they're winning

fed up next door on the fact that allowed ISIS to proliferate the fact that North Korea sent missiles over Japan I mean give me something Obama did that as stuck anything\nNot to not by the above above above a fan of a Trump fan I like the\nWell and and I met him running around but Louis Farrakhan who says ...\nOn that if Trump the eyes of the mothers about that\nHow is that possible health yeah I'm\nLooking at a tweeter sent out by Sarah Sanders\nThe scent this evening quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is such an unapologetic defender\nOf the Jewish community and the state of Israel and so you're a Washington Post ... there's a headline on Saturday that said bombs suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo you get your if Trump inspiring bombings and Trump been directly involved in killing Jews and the

and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas rescuing former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations where there was an attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning head on a neighbor lived next door to him or\nHave you had a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas ... former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas how're you\nGoing to be very tough situation awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and they had menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor\nA woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy\nAnd he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing out some how Trump's response of all the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nAnd today did ugly reporting saying that ah that in fact a series Sanders put out something a few hours ago that said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post went out exploit do\nAttack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective somebody said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should have known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nOr not as of yet I've seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was honoring his tweets his social media and his other things that he was hosting it couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the what we know when you say is a few things see something in this case you know someone at the scene\nAnd could've alerted the police the police we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or look to see if this guy does have guns or actually follow him we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the man\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even no call in or the FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo perfection on horse you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for civilians very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know my experience with the YPG we always look back we always did\nThat review of what happened and what we could do but at the same way that they're doing what the case the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said\nBecause I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings\nBecause those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville\nShouting slurs against ah against Jews\nAnd against African Americans there were several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so well when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nOn the left and on the right now they're waiting it'd be triggered by some event in many are mentally ill and many have guns now that doesn't mean any of us Tom rescued needs to stop exercising are free speech rights on their constitution but it does mean\nThat that that the media also plays a role in this one I've been watching CNN the past two days all I hear about is Trump and the Republicans responsible\nFor almost a mass murder of two former presidents plus the killing of twelve or fourteen others along with the attempts to the tide Donald Trump to what happened in Pittsburgh even though he's the only president in American history Deb Jewish grandchildren the only one in today's CNN tried to tee up to us\nA Israeli ambassador the as the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. I'm Sorry and he said that\nThe best friend Israel's ever had\nHas been Donald J Trump and that he's been wonderful for Israel and Trump is not responsible for what happened there the president's going to go to Pittsburgh and the next couple of days\nTo meet with those that have been wounded summer mortally wounded not likely to survive the number eleven is likely to go up and the president has said that it's time to lower the writer rhetoric just a little bit but the other side doesn't want to accept it in fact CNN and the Washington Post or indirectly accusing the president\nOf the murders in Pittsburgh and that is despicable man we we've got a calmness down and may look as if that a little overweight for now we're going to have an election may want to gin up the numbers to hurt the president hurt Republicans I Hope it doesn't work\nBut but Tom what you said about calming down relaxing a little bit when you're in New York City when I had my TV show there for five years completely different I live now in Cincinnati completely different culture a completely different things are going on\nBut one thing that unites is when you talk about a hurricane I Love what you said when a hurricane happens there is no one on the other side of the fence to argue in favor of the hurricane right now we're in a political hurricane and Americans need to be not red or blue or red white and blue would you agree\nI totally agree and take what you said even further\nThis president has a son in law who is orthodox very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what you said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter of law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a high school she's on the guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up its own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country is what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talking to someone the guy who was sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing guns\nAnd going into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Ross can former NPT NYPD officer thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to lower the rhetoric just a little bit because there is nuts everywhere Thomas thank you very much\nEveryone stays safe please God Bless Charlotte's continue\nWith more blind becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three ... bill counting on line with you every Sunday night [noise]\n\nMessage into your ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text market to seven nine six four or five\n...

information from the Senate select intel committee compared to what Adam Schiff sent me where he wanted me to get all the documents I give up or to Robert Mueller that they will\n... that they will treat this president they will handcuff them and that is why it is not feel something political to just say who you think Chinese corn too when you think the Iranians are going to win this mid

another thing in twenty ten Obama last sixty three house seats\nI said sixty three house seats\nIn ... and right now it's about twenty three twenty fours going to switch\nAnd so if Trump would lose in

continues David fair is with us is is I'm Sorry\nDavid raised with fair which is a group committed to trying to assist America of reasonable borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you of a put forth in the morning you're missing limbs and that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and then the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point of Central American migrants who's now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized stunt by political agitator as an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add it to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of his seven\nSeven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened\nWith the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the major media will deal with\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize\nDisrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing pets are suddenly appearing medical care is certainly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walking the Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are\nGordon they did and there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states in let's let's be honest here is it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably\nThe most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because of the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with ... million marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that are formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill
