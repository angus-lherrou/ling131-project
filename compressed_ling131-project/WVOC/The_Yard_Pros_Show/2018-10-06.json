or we turned it around and won five in the next six games in one non football games\n... that's a possibility now things are a\nTad different now because you don't have the senior leadership you had last year on defense you got ... a lot of young players you got some injuries and now your quarterback is hurt so I understand the concern I think the concern was ratcheted up a little bit with Jake getting hurt 'em but I still think\nYou know it's a little too early to panic and so early in the season they've only point for football games they showed last year a remarkable ability to get better and\nBetter as the season went along if you think back to early last year they made a ton of mistakes and that Kentucky game employed terribly\nThe next week they did it again and barely be Louisiana Tech but what happened the rest of the season that defense got better and better and better they all things got better and better and better and as the season went along they were beaten did football\nTeams so I think that possibility is still there I think the coaching staff did a great job last year making adjustments putting people in the right place and given their team an opportunity to be successful and improve and uh I got to believe that they're going to do that this year but you're right it does start today and this was a much more challenging football\nGame a game today than we\nParticipated if you're going into the season\n... was fairly competitive and that Georgia game a couple of weeks ago and as you mentioned there are a number of factors stacked up against Carolina the fact that you got the injuries especially\nThe big one to Jake Bentley so what's the winning formula this afternoon in and let's start with the crowd and we're we're seeing that it's family weekend we're seeing a on a early morning game when you might not have the number of fans we're seeing a fairly solid stream already heading into posted the stadium\nYeah I think they got to be here uh you know if you're if you're concerned and you're down on the pain than being here we are here and be loud and and make make a difference and the I think they can make a big difference today because you got to know you're you're playing against a team that has a very effective\nAll bets are so the crowd noise can be a big factor for them and I think that's got to be part of the game today but but you know I think you've got to do the simple things uh\nBut that's the thing a must have preached all we all you got to do the simple things better than we've been doing um which means you gotta tackle or you got to run the football I think running the football we've\nWe've talked about that all year long I think it might be more important today than it's been an game we played a if you can run the ball effectively today not only are you taking pressure off of Jake ... and scar and and helping them a little bit but you're keeping drew lock in that off the\nOff the football field you got to run the ball you got to convert on third down you got to sustain drives you know I Know we got a up tempo fast\nStrike all fans today might be a day when you might want to back off all of that a little bit and control the football and run it because the more you can keep it out of Missouri's ants the better chance you got to win this gang secondaries got a boy well we've got to tackle up better it last week\nI just will see you next week we'll see\nHow many of those things come through this afternoon Williams rice and\nWe'll see if the panic is on or if the game ... right the

Missouri of course here in town they'll visit Carolina today at noon on the SEC Network we welcome you back to our best ... set up is always right across the street from Williams price of course for jobs and joined now by former game jak assistant Eric Wilson an error you've seen the state newspapers\nOr report it will probably be Michael ... in all likelihood that starts at quarterback today for Carolina it's ... he was taken most of the rats in practice this week so how much\nLegitimately can you get a cue be ready to go with one week's time\nWill Michael's the number two guy so you know that he's been getting some wraps the entire season I mean as as an authentic coordinator as a head coach you always have to have your number two guy\nReady to go so he it's not like he hasn't been getting snaps at all uh for this week the you know what they've got to do and I'm sure what they have done is they've got to know what is Michael ... do well in terms of you know what routes Eric ... is he comfortable with\nUh what's the good in terms of throwing the ball at you know whether he's get better throwing the outs with the crossing route those kinds of things so basically kind of dialing the the playbook down to a point where they feel really good about his ability to execute it because that's what it all comes down to and I think probably you\nKnow one of the biggest things that could potentially change with him starting\nIs the a breath of the AARP yo package so\nThat's the biggest thing that you don't get with a lot of of game time a blank time is just experiencing the field experience making those calls so my guess is if he's the guy starting you're probably going to see\nMore cold calls just in terms of calling a play from the line or give them just a real clear delineation and not not quite as many Arpaio's or they might usually run\nHe's a senior he's not a freshman this will be his first experience but he's had very limited experience in game time and and you wonder especially with the way the game ... played better defensively and the second half you wonder just how important it is from a confidence factor not only for ... but also for the guys playing in front of him behind him to get off to a strong start today\nReally important and I think one of the biggest things that they that they've got to do when he talks about you know when when coach much ... talks about the simple stuff it's really oh you want to talk about basic stuff don't bumble the ball I mean look at the amount of times that you know from a Rico data turned the ball over you know who's your number one go to guy or even\nIn the game last week you know with a turnover and many situations there what South Carolina's been doing at the beginning of this year and in these competitive games is the exact opposite of what they did last year there they're not taking advantage of creating turnovers and giving the often so short field they're doing that for the other team\nSo they're way too many turnovers on the officer side of the ball and too many easy scoring opportunities for the opponent so that to start with\nDon't turn of all over and then catch the football how many times have we seen in these you know especially last week just dropped balls by he players\nFor South Carolina I'm ... balls on important drives a Brian Edwards has dropped balls unimportant drives so just\nExecute go out and do the things you're supposed to do is not like they have to go\nChanged the game plan or turn the entire thing upside down you got to do the basics\nThrow catch block tackle\nRight now from everything I've seen it these two teams I'm taking this state and the game that's not the Alabama guy and me that is the fact that I just don't think God smells aren't going to get out of his own way and allow offered to do what they can do well in this ball game which would be throw the football around does not be deep pass it\nI'm just saying five or six yard work wrapped across the middle out routes let them do what he can do well in short that arm the right now he's not have been allowed to do that so I'm going to the state until ... we thought the different\nMississippi State only lost by it touched down last weekend an emotional game with their former coach Dan Mullen but did you expect to see more out of the bulldogs\nI did expect to see more out of Mississippi State I really had I expectations for them I thought they would battle with Auburn for that second best spot in the SEC west this year about and it was a year way I thought that LSU was going to be not LSU that we've seen so far this season I was way off on that production so far\nBut Mississippi State Nick Fitzgerald have a big issue coming to head if they lose a ball game ... Fitzgerald may not be the starting quarterback following week and this is a guy that everyone was touting for a dark horse Heisman candidate\nI just not the kind of team that we expected to see on off ants from Mississippi State the defense has played decently well ... the blind I think it's one of the better ones in the conference\nBut the defense can't get it done enough admits the state the season they've got to have the often does help and if they can't get it done they're going to move on to the next guy\nWill the next guy is keeps on Thompson who look great in the opener against even at Boston with such Gerald suspended but That's Stephen F Austin not an FCC opponent and just like ... Fitzgerald Thompson is also still learning this Joe more head off into change probably not the answer right now for the bulldogs will see tonight ate drank Auburn\nVisiting Mississippi State that game

Conference a year ago [noise] and we played really intense football on and when you self employed ... ... when I won't tolerate it's been a dress oh if I'm In a situation where I can sum and get you know a month or so we're very sending some spots\nSo I I have a hard time solvent I Want to laws aren't our football team\nBecoming ... really poor decision but it's being address\nOn and we have this one an organization there was eleven Phillies on the other side of the mall to one side there's twenty two total penalties\nAnd and so again I I'm not tolerating it all ties\nIt hurt our football team is really critical situation as much as anything the hidden your age is far slip in the fields and things have really really hurt us in the game but in the early ... see a year ago and we've got discipline at home as\nWe step over the line sometimes I Would rather say whoa and getting Jaycee want to have to say that a lot which is an awesome thing to be able to say I wish we had more to be honest with you know 'cause really good ... good players I've been around\nYou say that a lot a lot you had to pull them back you had to pull him off the field at times since I've been around a bunch it's really fun [noise] really fun and we'll get they're\nNot asking for rocket science after the loss of Kentucky\nWe need you need to do the basic fundamentals in a what we need to do better they go back and look at it and we had\nHad some guys open that we went as we had some guy who threw the ball with didn't catch it we would fall down running for a touchdown I mean there there are some things we just need to do some of the simple things really we we get bounce out of a gap on twenty four yard run we should've never one of our base calls in what we do trying to\nWe're calling that call to settle everybody down and and we get bounced out of a gap and and you know I again we just need to do the simple things about\nOver just aren't coming their way and twenty Eighteen that's been extremely frustrating you look at the first four games will get four turnovers enough\nYou know as much as we emphasize it and go through it uh you know that's been that's been an extremely disappointing part of not creating momentum for our team creating filled position for our team are in those situations such a it's been a something we're continue to address and now we got we got to find ways to get them all the time\nThey're still embracing the temple often I think it's helped us I think you look in some situations you go back to our last ballgame in charge of running the football they ...\nInto situations uh you know one thing as as I said during the summer and and going into training camp is more about dictating the temple the games are there are some time for a little bit more methodical and as far as those things are concerned and how we felt like\nIn the last game expression because of the multiple friends we needed to be able to get into the right place\nAnd when we used to place it on and let Jake you go from there so I'm you know the temple has helped us in in a certainly\nStress in the defense I think as much as anything else well again I think it's gained the game and uh you know with with him at the end of the day when you have for eternal just hard to continue to temple mandatory you go you know three and three three separate times in the first half it's it's hard to create that so we gotta stay on the field and\nHis team's turn the page after that loss in Lexington he could tell this week in practice I think in you know in
