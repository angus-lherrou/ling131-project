first time in like six months\nI might be able to get back into it for a short window while the temperatures are good maybe but only probably about twelve holes and then I'm bored gotta move on to something else you know I don't make twelve oh golf courses and just say but large patch it's out there if you hadn't put the phone just signed a few got sent a Pete if you've got Georgia\nIf you've got saint Augustine you've gotta get headway the pillar out I mean you got to get it with the amount of rain that we're we're getting from time to time things of that nature it is time\nTime to get that product out I'm Scott let's go to the tax real quick let's get this first will not a done good morning I'm perched palisades was about twelve years ago from Carolina fresh farms last couple of years I've had one or killing a few spots\nThought it was large patch but had a piece of Saud yesterday about Clinton exchange and know disease was present any way to prevent winter kill this takes I'm is in a couple of things\nUh takes until July to repair itself also risotto those areas any thoughts I Do think I Know you Senator Clinton and that's fine and dandy but I Do think it's large patch guy I don't think it's as easy as winter kill I don't see as much one or two just from your cold causing issues\nHere's reason comes from probably didn't see large patch it may not be active at this point in your yard as warm as we have been all the way through October would just now getting to that point where it's cooling off enough where you can see that large patch okay\nSo it may not be active in your yard right now in your soul and if it's not active it's not going to be their nephew dug up six inches even if you dig up six inches of soil it's going to be hard to see\nI still suspect is probably large pets don't fall into the trap of hey it's not large patches one or two so I'm not going to spend my money on fungicides get the phone just thought out because I guarantee you that is what's contributing\nTo this downfall here's the other do\nSometimes large patch might not present in the fall Scott it may it may not be there and to begin to see the soles warm in the spring of the year may lie dormant believe it or not and as a soldier begin to warm in the spring of the year but what happens\nLarge patch disappears when the ... temperature or above Seventy so when we get the salt temperatures up above Seventy and spring it here it goes away it's hard to detect you don't know what's there right ... and it can be the same situation when you send a sample to a lab\nBecause of salt temperatures will still above Seventy sold temperatures virtually everywhere in our state\nIs probably not really showing up everywhere at this point so I still suspect I hate to go against my alma mater though I went to school there I Know Meghan those folks do a great job in the diagnostic lab they also are diagnostic diagnosing\nWhat is it to you send them today but not the plant material you sent them when this plant had an issue back in the spring of the year\nSo or back last winter so\nAre you still need to do the fungicides if it is one or two uh one thing I think\nAll we keep them alone fully handwriting or we keep it enough water on the grass during the winter that's going to help protect you from one or kill what is the growing environments is it a shade of your environment that stays excessively wet in the winter if so we need to figure out how to either get more sunlight\nImprove the drainage or a combination of the two right because I Know the grass if you're in the normal part of the upstate all the way up to the base of the mountains of North Carolina that grass we just we typically don't see a lot of what we call winter kill ... year after year may have seen some last year\nBecause of our weird weather punished but we don't really don't see that year after year\nSo Scott let's go to the phone lines we have Bob in Greer\nHello Bob and welcome to the ...\nOh thank you I Know Scott hockey again nice to talk with you\nHey I've got a question for you or I did a little down a little re reading on a ... and plugging scarf ing and so forth and I like to get your views on those three things with regard to fess skew on in the fall\nOkay as far as what and the second one by one\n[noise] okay [noise] um\nI Know you've talked about plugging before and the issues with plugging or the plugs come out and then you get seeds go down in holes and then you don't break up the plugs and so forth and so on and\nAnd uh the set and and that doesn't really allow for a lot of seat area especially if you have any kind of fat you at all in their ah\nAh so is fetching better than a plug in\nYou know for most loans and and and I know I'm going to have some lawn care operators fuss at me for saying this most residential loans Bob unless you just have you know fourteen high school boys playing rugby or football on your front lawn\nIf there's really no need for those laws to become severely compacted over a period of one to two to three years now eight years down the road and you do nothing to it you might see some soul complexion\nSo if the sauce not compacted and you just want to go out there and remove some of that fat layer because the grass deteriorated there in the summer that's when we see excessive ... typically because some of that fast you die during the summer\nI if you go out there and removed that thatch lighter and get back to a little bit more of the saw sowed the seeds ... yes I think you're better off doing that\nThan worrying about air for cash in Korea for cash and pulling plugs out of the loan now the longest not draining well\nIf the law is severely compacted than air for cash and certainly something you need to do I will tell you my personal loan I\nHave not air from the front lawn and four five six years\nThere's no need for me too because I Know I can pick a screwdriver out and I can insert a screwdriver won the ... or hydrated water if you do this one is dry all sold profiles we're going to the other than saying they're going to be pretty compacted because they don't have enough soil moisture\nBut when I have adequate soul moisture I can insert a screwdriver\nWith minimal effort I'm not going to say zero effort but with minimal effort if I can push a screwdriver and three or four inches deep\nAnd and not have to put all of my nearly two hundred pounds of body weight behind it to get there get a hammer out the ... that's typically pliable enough now if I'm seeing some compacted growth an area but don't see that as much focus more on Bermuda is always fun seeing a lot of compacted growth\nAnd smaller dwarfed growth and in that area alone I Would imagine that area is probably compacted pretty severely I mean let the screwdriver to I mean it's kind of a touch it's kind of a feel when you say Scott ... I mean and it's got ... enemy\nWhat's your ... I was five years I mean yeah ... or ... a quarter of a loan so\nBut if you have to ask you your receiving yes I think what's equally Puerto if you're compacted yes you need to air filed the law and pull the corps but you\nAlso even if you do that you're still in a situation where you need to figure out how to remove some of that thatch layer so that the sea can make soil contact best to keep\nWell hear your thoughts have been my thoughts all along and uh many years ago I have a John Deere walk behind lower that I bought a thatch attach or men for the front of it and it doesn't do what a rental Thatcher would do really tear it up\nPretty good but it does a pretty good job and my soil is we've been in the house for thirty seven years and it is really alone soil there's no uh we don't have any um clay in it and it doesn't really get compacted there's nobody like you say of rugby team running all over\nAnd and so I think that's been done really well in the past but now I'm going to move on to the next question [noise] um [noise] for Ford they are on a Monday I did the front I I ... I had cut it down previously to two inches\nAnd then I ... and then um of course I picked up the thatch and then I received it and I put starter fertilizer four days later\nWe had that big hurricane part of it come up here and I got four inches of rain in this area will live at and and the seeds or slower to come up\nWill that amount of water hurt the seeds or kill them or drown them are\nTypically not that the concern I Would have is that amount of water is it going to move the seed you know as long as you can physically see to see their Bob and ... know\nThat you know looking at the seed if if you're looking at it you can physically see there and you're happy with the distribution the mouse see there I Would be patient you know I Do feel like with the cloudy weather\nThe little bit cooler temperatures I'm from that storm it's kind of slowed some German nation down um and I think that's what you're seeing more than anything\nYeah about three days or three or four days earlier than that I did the back and that has really come up nice ... and\nProbably had opportunity German I a little bit more sunlight before the storm hit now I Will say this I've seen some funky things in my own lawn I'm sending this year and I was gonna mentioned it this morning\nThat it kind of in between the two storms you know I did my seat fairly early I think I got it out or maybe brought before Florence right after in between those two storms because we got so warm and muggy um I actually have some disease to come back in some brown patch to become active again that was still kind of laying there lightly because\nYou know a horticulture ... works for Assad company that sells products it's too hard for me to find 'em ... decided to put on my yard yeah right right Bob I'm but yet you know I'm I'm like the ... the cobbler's kid the ... kids that you know they never have shoes to wear 'em but yeah I think there were still\nThe last coach broader is right is I think since ... products which who makes headway has the less goes predator setting on their bag if I'm not mistaken\nThe outlook yeah 'cause I don't know if I saw it on there or not or somebody told me go put it on about six to eight yeah sixty or fourteen on\n... and and one thing I'd asked adjust you are the homeowner you are the end user and you are the ... that's the most important part you are the ...\nWe've said this a long time in the stores we really hesitate to give any suggestions we might do it but we hesitate to do it for two reasons number one that suggested right that's on that bag may not be exact okay it's just adjusted right\nNumber two because we deal with so many products and so many scenarios it's hard to remember what a hundred percent certainty what everything is about um whether we were a hundred percent remember that correctly so\nI think you know how to calibrate and you take the time to calibrate I Know it takes a little bit of time it would be worth your time to know and then we're corner of information and having the future\nYeah you got to the kitchen scale night so that was a lot of time to take a few pounds at three pounds that's Ronald ... what that looks like anybody I Know that there was a ... on the Syrian thirty up yeah thirty pounds yet you are so well I appreciate it I have a good weekend\nYou do the same but you've given us a call on a happy weekend gardening shot you know great call good question is well over man we lost the call or maybe we'll get another caller here and a few seconds what are you so I think so [noise]\nSome folks you are listening to\nThe your approach show oh Scott showing it to me\nI skipped this morning says we have a minute left before the bottom of our right where do you think Scott we got we got time\nWhat does it give me the drum all this the drought report all their ... with a little bit of marsh Tucker\nFor folks looking fairly decent\nCoastal South Carolina extreme south west coast Charleston down in that area Boston Hilton Head that area we are seeing some drought as well as it looks like Anderson McCormack Greenwood counties\nStill seeing a little bit of drought and those areas folks will be aware of that keep your souls\nTrying to keep your plants how dry to keep your grass as hard drive and we're going into winter ... looks like at a rapid pace we want to make sure that sells structures hydraulic going into it you're listening to your approach show give us a call during this bombing our bright to one eight hundred three four seven one six three that's eight hundred three four\nSeven one six three and we will come back we'll get back to that tax on seven one three zero seven and will answer a few questions to talk to you in a few [noise]\n[noise] did you get a crystal clear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters in service to maintained by crystal pools L.
