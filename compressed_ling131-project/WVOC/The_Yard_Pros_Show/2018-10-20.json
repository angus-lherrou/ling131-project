different type level than maybe here but\nAny pool builder or\nConstruction a company that's worth or solve has got to have something in place to specifically in gun I swimming pools 'em to where there there's going to be a little valve and the bottom that I'll pop and so water's going to find a way if there's a lot of water underneath a swimming pool it's got to look for somewhere to go and so would that\nLittle valve when it pops up that's where the pressure can be released and the ... not going to want to follow it out or get out of a where needs to be\nIf that happens do you have to reset that\nAt that point you're looking at a just about a new project I mean we're really in some that have that have come completely out of the ground\nUm and it it starts to shift everything and it's pretty it's pretty wild side ... the concrete cracks at that point you're worried about plumbing breaking because everything's attached and sort of that whole thing lips ... you start having some serious issues and um that's the last thing that we we won't for anybody\nTalking to beat a live video on pools and spy and we we talked a couple of weeks ago with him we talked about uh your your company and uh\nHow it's it's just it's a great American success story started in your your dad's garage as I recall\nAbsolutely yeah it'd be Twenty years in December um and that's just growing and then there's this really blessed unfortunate that\nUh we're staying busy I mean it just is become a ... year round\nUm zero worked for us and and folks are still building and exciting and excited to be a as a as a housing market grows and people were building new homes are excited to put swimming pools in the backyard or they're moving maybe to a new home that\nAre maybe has a better backyard set up so it's a it's exciting people are are excited in this area to for some of the projects that were working on and um we're happy to be out here\nBut you do all sorts I mean from the typical you know run of the mail for lack of a better term type of fooled but you also do some really special\nYeah very very we we do everything from your standard sixteen by thirty two rectangle or and we do some that are that are really a spectacular people have\nGreat visions and ideas of what they want their back yard to look like and and we tell folks all the time and trust Google Images those kind of things with your friend like go and look at these ideas and ... our design team is really talented and our our our our building group guys are really talented and we can put\nA lot of those ideas that you have in that you see on the line\nInto into practice for you we we have um some ... to sign I'm\nTechnology that we show folk so you can look at what's your backyard is going to look like before we break ground you're going to know what\nYou're set up is going to look like before the first piece of dirt has moved in and it really helps you to get a better sense of what you're getting what maybe what you like maybe what you don't like and so\nUm it's it's one of those things that we feel like we provide the kind of sets us apart and you also a service pools as well absolutely yes are we do all all aspects from from construction\nTo service after the sale to service on polls that we haven't built um we we run the whole gamut rather you're looking\nTo have to fix equipment upgrade maybe two I'm One of those characters filters we were just talking about or maybe some bearable St Paul's that will save you a little bit on your power bill\nBut we also do weekly weekly cleaning and maintenance so if if you want the swimming pool experience without having to deal with the and the swimming pool um work if you will\nWere here for that as well yeah because we are supposed to be fun absolutely not work that that is the goal and ah we we try to remind ourselves in our customers without all the time it's we we sell fun and we saw a good time and I think uh that's something that we we bring to the table and\nUm we make the process easy as possible\nI didn't want to ask you because you talk you mentioned upgrades a minute ago uh I Know for years you had a you know the the system of chlorine in the regular system and and now I mean the new trend seems to be the salt water pools what's the difference between the two and why should you should you not upgrade\nYes all ... have become ... industry ... why does have really taken off\nIt did you say it's a standard now I mean for new pools and most of them salt water but I think probably eighty percent of the the ... and rebuilding our our wonderful goat folks\nLove the idea of it and if you think about when you were growing up as a kid when more Korean baseballs were the norm and kind of a smell and maybe the irritation in the eyes and I'm just ... some people their skins maybe just a little more sensitive to that\nSalt pools help to take that away a little bit now there's there's a common misconception that oh well you know I've got a small portal corner wherever we go back to school a little bit\nSalt is sodium chloride so there's there's Korean and salt and when it goes through that salt so there is electrons as that happens and it breaks that up and it creates\nScoring there in the line rather than having a dumping directly into the swimming pool so can you still have that age they're this helping keep it clean helping the bad bacteria and all that stuff that we don't want in the swimming pool or out\nBut it's just a little bit easier process as a little bit easier process all on the backside\nIs it easier to maintain the salt water political and baseball\n[noise] as long as you stay on top of it uh it is you can you can set your percentage on how how much corn you want it to generate how much you want it to make them\nBut you still it's like anything any any investment that you make your own your car a swimming pool you still need to to make sure that you're staying on top of your chemicals that your water chemistry your equipment\nRight ballpark the ripples different ... different big or whatever but if you wanted to go from a current Korean basis salt water system which we talk\nSo you're you're still working somewhere about twelve to Fifteen hundred dollar upgrade for your standard salt um system now you we truly believe that you're going to save\nMoney over the long haul uh doing that I'm not to mention just the uh the comfort of of not having to deal with some of the the skin irritation for some folks out\nAnd you can go up to three thousand dollars for some of the the larger set ups or the uh easy touched set up to where everything's right there on a board that you can control from inside your house\nTechnology signed me up for the yeah technologies

Georgia about twelve years ago from Carolina fresh farm slash couple of years I've had one or killing a few spots\nThought it was large patch\nBut had a piece of Saud yesterday about Clinton exchange and know disease was present any way to prevent one or two this\nTakes I'm is in a couple of things uh takes until July to repair itself also already sort of the series any thoughts I Do think I Know you send it to come to them that's fine and dandy\nBut I Do think it's large patch guy\nThink it's as easy as winter kill I don't see as much one or two old just from your cold causing issues here's reason comes from probably didn't see large patch it may not be active at this point in your yard as warm as we have been all the way through October would just\nAnd I'm getting to that point where it's cooling off enough where you can see that large patch okay\nSo it may not be active in your yard right now in your soul and if it's not active it's not going to be their nephew dug up six inches even if you dig up six inches of soil it's going to be hard to see\nI still suspect there's probably large patch don't fall into the trap of hey it's not large patches one or two so I'm not going to spend my money on fungicides get the phone just shot out because I guarantee you that is what's contributing\nTo this downfall here's the other do\nSometimes large patch may not present in the fall Scott it may it may not be there to begin to see the soles warm in the spring of the year may lie dormant believe it or not and as a soldier begin to warm in the spring of the year but what happens\nLarge patch disappears when the temperature of ... or above Seventy so when we get the sole temperatures up above Seventy and spring it a year it goes away it's hard to detect you don't know what's there right and it can be the same situation when you send a sample to a lab\nBecause of salt temperatures will still above Seventy sold temperatures virtually everywhere in our state\nIt's probably not really showing up everywhere at this point so I still suspect I hate to go against my alma mater though I went to school there I Know Meghan those folks do a great job in the diagnostic lab they also are diagnostic diagnosing\nWould apply to you send them today but not the plant material you sent them when this plant had an issue back in the spring of the year so or back last winter so are you still need to do to fund decide if it is one or two one thing I could think\nOnly keeping the loan fully hydrated and we keep it enough water on the grass during the winter that's going to help protect you from winter kill what is the growing environments is it a shady your environment that stays excessively wet winter if so we need to figure out how to either get more sunlight\nImprove the drainage or a combination of the two right because I Know the grass if you're in the normal part of the upstate all the way up to the base of the mountains of North Carolina that grass we just we typically don't see a lot of what we call winter kill ... year after year may have seen some last year\nBecause of our weird weather punished but we don't we don't see that year after year so Scott\nLet's go to the phone lines we have Bob in Greer hello Bob and walk into your approach\nWow thank you ... Scott good luck to you again nice to talk with you hey I've got a question\nFor you or I did a little down a little re reading on a fetching and plugging scar thing and so forth and I like to get your views on those three things with regard to fess skew on in the fall\nOkay as far as what and the second one by one\nOkay [noise] um I Know you've talked about plugging before and the issues with plugging are the plugs come out and then you get seeds go down in holes and then you don't break up the plugs and so forth and so on and\nAnd uh the set and and that doesn't really allow for a lot of seed area especially if you have any kind of fat you at all in their ah ah so is fetching better than a plug in\nYou know for most loans and and and I know I'm going to have some lawn care operators fuss at me for saying this most residential loans Bob unless you just have you know fourteen high school boys playing rugby or football on your front lawn\nIf there's really no need for those laws to become severely compacted over a period of one to two to three years now eight years down the road and you do nothing to it you might see some soul complexion\nSo if the sauce not compacted and you just want to go out there and remove some of that ... because the grass deteriorated there in the summer that's when we see excessive factional fest typically because some of that fest you die during the summer\nI if you go out there and removed that thatch lighter and get back to a little bit more of the saw sowed the seeds ... yes I think you're better off doing that\nThan worrying about Arab occasional Korea for cash and pulling plugs out of the loan NAFTA alone is not draining well\nIf the loan is severely compacted than air for cash and certainly something you need to do I will tell you my personal loan I\nHave not air fired the front lawn and four five six years\nThere's no need for me too because I Know I can pick a screwdriver out and I can insert a screwdriver won the ... or hydrated water if you do this one is dry all sold profiles we're going to the other than saying we're going to be pretty compacted because they don't have enough saw moisture\nBut when I have adequate soul moisture I can insert a screwdriver\nWith minimal effort I'm not going to say zero effort but with minimal effort if I can push a screwdriver and three or four inches deep and and not have to put all of my nearly two hundred pounds of body weight behind it to get their or get a hammer out\nThe soles are that typically pliable enough now if I'm seeing some compact the growth an area but don't see that as much focus more on Bermuda is always fun seeing a lot of compacted growth\nAnd smaller dwarfed growth and in that area I'm Alone I Would imagine that area is probably compacted pretty severely I mean let the screwdriver to I mean it's kind of a touch it's kind of a feel when you say Scott ... I mean and it's got ... enemy\nWhat's you know as I was five years I mean yeah ... or ... or a quarter of a loan so\nBut if you have to ask you your receiving yes I think what's equally Puerto if you're a compacted yes you need to air filed the law and pull the corps but you also even if you\nDo that you're still in a situation where you need to figure out how to remove some of that thatch layer so that the sea can make soil contact best to keep\nWell hear your thoughts of been my fought so long and uh many years ago I have a John Deere walk behind lower that I bought a thatch attach or men for the front of it and it doesn't do what of a rental Thatcher would do really tear it up\nPretty good but it does a pretty good job and my soil is we've been in the house for thirty seven years and it is really alone soil there's no uh we don't have any um clay and it and it doesn't really get compacted there's no way like you say a rugby team run out all over\nAnd and so I think that's been done really well in the past but now I'm going to move on to the next question [noise] um [noise] for for ... on a Monday I did the front I I ...\nI had cut it down previously to two inches and then I ... and then um of course I picked up the thatch and then I received it and I put started a fertilizer four days later\nWe had that big hurricane part of it come up here and I got four inches of rain in this area will live at and and the seeds or slower to come up\nWill that amount of water hurt the seeds or kill them or drowned them are\nTypically not that the concern I Would have is that amount of water is it going to move the seed you know as long as you can physically see to see their Bob and and don't know\nThat you know looking at the seed if if you're looking at it you can physically see there and you're happy with the distribution the mouse see there I Would be patient you know I Do feel like\nWith the cloudy weather the little bit cooler temperatures I'm from that storm it's kind of slowed some German nation down um and I think that's what you're seeing more than anything\nYeah about three days or three or four days earlier than that I did the back and that has really come up nice ... and\nHad an opportunity German I a little bit more sunlight before the storm hit now I Will say this I've seen some funky things in my own mom I'm sitting here and I was going to mention that this morning\nThat it kind of in between the two storms you know I did my seat fairly early I think I got it out or maybe brought before Florence right after in between those two storms because we got so warm and muggy um I actually have some disease to come back in some brown patch to become active again that was still kind of laying there lightly because\nYou know a horticulture ... works for Assad company that sells products it's too hard for me to find 'em fungicides put on my yard yeah right right Bob I'm but yet you know I'm I'm like the ... the cobbler's kid the ... kids\nIt's a good weekend you do the same thank you for giving us a call on a happy weekend gardening Scott you know a great call good questions ... man we lost the call or maybe we'll get another caller here in a few seconds what are you so I\nThink so yeah maybe maybe perhaps so folks\nYou are listening to your show all Scott's showing it to me I I skipped this morning says we have a minute left before the bottom of our bright what do you think Scott we've got we've got time what is it can be drawn role is to drop report oh there's drum roll with a little bit of marsh Tucker [noise]\nDrive report folks looking fairly decent\nCoastal South Carolina extreme southwest coast Charleston down in that area Boston Hilton Head that area we are seeing some drought as well as it looks like Anderson McCormack in Greenwood counties\nStill seeing a little bit of drought and those areas folks will be aware of that keep your sauce hot trying to keep the plants had tried to keep your grass has hired right we're going into winter ... looks like at a rapid pace\nWe want to make sure that sells structures hydraulic going into it you're listening to your show give us a call during this bombing our break a one eight hundred three four seven one six three that's eight hundred three four seven one six three and we will come back we'll get back to that tax on seven one three zero seven and will answer a few questions to talk to you in a few [noise]\n[noise] hit a crystal\nClear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters and service didn't maintained by crystal pools L.
