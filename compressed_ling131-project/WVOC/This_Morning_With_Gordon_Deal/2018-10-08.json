nothing to fear and move along meaning that number is being widely regarded as being accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nWe believe the trend remains in

years ago the Federal Reserve project or an a sense adjusted about project it back and look for and a half or so was this actually employment in our country and ... and below that level for uh Eighteen months\nUh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers employers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent to ... percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with mark ... senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously\nA well for one that's an average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about how ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that it leads to a modest degree as for informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience do you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nAh and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I fit as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWith it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so\nI'm to the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world\nAh and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked by people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh the but you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend it in other words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nOf but I think for most of us I think the the most important

his stump speech about having visited all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state uh and some of these guys are very small uh some of the county is that\nEven that I was

been so Republican uh one of the things he says on the campaign trail that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state\nI can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by his house district in El Paso or having voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the campaign trail is drawn
