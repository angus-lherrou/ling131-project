Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hearty\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about it's currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had the Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada\nUm this is a little bit probably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a

challenging decisions facing the central bank more from Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick Samaras Nick what's up here\nThat what the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve it really doesn't have a recent precedent us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W. Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last president to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do with it and it has not happened since Nineteen Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite the manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been kind of a difference in many respects to the president and the other example he's saying things about the fatty blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy\nHe said that they were his biggest threat up and that's not something that we're really used to seeing Wright's\nRight so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said but part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fed a if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there's some speculation there about why he's doing this if you look at the letters to the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people that are sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House\nBoat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's doing is just kind of up and running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year\nAnd while the fed says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else as per usual when the president does something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] that's exactly right people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is two and President Trump is probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow\nAnd the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a flak disappears and the economy because you don't want to have inflation but what ... what President Trump is saying here as well world the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates that we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nSpeaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter his piece is called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be ... to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very difficult right now the fed most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case a year from now let's say a year from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a close call where you don't have as much conviction about the policy path to the president's criticisms get in your head at all I Know some people who say\nLook this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously at the point that you identify as the other side which says look if markets but getting the question if that credibility\nAnd that's even worse and so it might actually stiffen their backs a little bit but the fed so far as saying working again or this\nOr we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that next\nNick Wall Street journal economics reporter Nick Tim morose it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
