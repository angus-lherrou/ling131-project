[noise]\nTotal access to the world\nYou are listening to America's\nLike me with a ... what a difference\nYou can mix before Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandoned judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the midterm elections or attack Dr Ford and reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nAll even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his his accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nA in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him in partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling underway and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so that has at least for the time being\nA little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans are Republicans and a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nA big one is we've seen in North Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA we're now in the upper single digits in terms of his lead in the polling averages a you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking Heitkamp down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen\nA I think we've seen also a ... has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that did have a three but in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrowly it\nAnd this could be a race to influence but by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a a very political process so it's become much more so in recent years says each party has begun to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted in their party's favor\nBut certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections where Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump\nThey dislike Republicans are doing a Washington seems to them like another power grab by Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump as the first place was wanted conservative judges they cared about who is controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal to have Anthony Kennedy seat go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and toys sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term elections so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nWhen
