new report by the center for political accountability studies annual political spending policies as simply five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred and twenty Fifteen increasing numbers\nOr either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies uh you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom\nTo swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always at the lobby they've always got a lot of money in Washington and then state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates in other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party\nOr you know the Democratic Republican uh governor's a tax cut that basically support a direct getting governors one party or the other\nOr a similar to ... attorneys general and state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large public companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to war is these are yes\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase up backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produces report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at that that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies\nHave been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclose a in a how and where and when they span and in some cases how much they spend on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example that used to publish a report on the political activity and now they don't or their reports are much informative than it used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining the asking the five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their uh to display the political standing reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and come up and then the index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies reference to Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was a mayor they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in me in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on political spending\nIn talking to me they said their position hadn't changed they still don't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute a nonprofit groups like fiber one she fours twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language to Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or and they tell their trade associations not to use it as fun\nFor a election activities so that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political accountability but then also a some\nA shareholder activists or shoulder advocates\nHave put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know show holders have what's called the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either see and how those votes

all in a bid to thwart Russian hackers\nBut the first of its kind pilot program has sharply divided the tech community between supporters who say represents the future of secure elections and critics who argue it does little to fix the problems inherent in online voting more from Danny Boyle and national security correspondent at the Washington Times Dan what's happening\nHappening in West Virginia is that you're trying to wrestle with the issue of how to process ballots from their residents who are overseas are serving in the military these ballot sometimes are difficult to get in on time because it's maps of the ballot\nSo what we're doing is taking a pretty bold step of saying actually we use a smartphone applications\nTo allow folks overseas to vote and kind of the most experimental way or that exists in the country right now\nWow All right so several presidential elections ago we would not even have considered this from a technology standpoint but these days has to be asked what's the uh the hacking riskier\n[noise] well I Know that that's a big issue because a lot of folks\nHave said you know what what on earth is going on here you know in the last election twenty six to like you guys are talk extensively about in Russia would at a\nDepartment of homeland security said that they were Twenty one state states that were pulled by Russian hackers looking for
