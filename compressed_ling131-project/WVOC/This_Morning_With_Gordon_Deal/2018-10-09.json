memory and so he's in a position where the court could do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law but as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and you know the whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and enter the challenge for that she\nWill be to to try to steer the court through these ... mean are pretty rough partisan times without also just looking like another part of somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of these Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him here it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times\nThe cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't\nThat's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times and on\nOn issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal last year the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know in justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable member of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him\nJust to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time any any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strong conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFind ways to moderate and end up for common ground with you know with a cross section of people in the court

York just seeing this headlines\nAll over breaks your heart rate but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or loss\nPsychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly empathic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who\nAre sensitive and loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of an accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed\nAnd so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion neurons in the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such a an interest in and out of the ... standing impact and thought\nThat the mirror neurons to compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a CAT scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle you weren't mirror neurons get activated that much more show and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all like ... patients has to take news fast\nYou know not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on for a lot of stress and negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many facets go out in nature medicate exercise Brandon laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas triggered for instance you know at the last year father\nAnd you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident no your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different you know get the could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now\nBe able to meditate go outside um learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then I don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things and the news you don't want to be around energy vampires so I write about they're destroying your energy\nWe speak with Dr Judas oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all the stress from other people's tragedy caused themselves long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely and and pass it don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book can
