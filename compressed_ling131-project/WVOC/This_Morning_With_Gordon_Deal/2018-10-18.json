Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAnd there are two issues the mess direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care and some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah there there are some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and this time [noise] um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut if you're trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid the people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some some pushback from state officials in some other states and one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to\nPay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays for most of the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the cars\nIn Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe governor there has refused to go along in part because the funding issues in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative from\nHow similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main threat to the same that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people out there are enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um [noise] but this is an issue one reason it's still um percolating as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country [laughter] one argument for why that's happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voter say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece entitled midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nIt potentially they're Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho has worked on how to care issues for a number of years on on a hill and he said a foreign with healthcare reporters that he thinks if these initiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could have a sort of trend for the rest of the states that that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking the Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that advocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as a imposing work requirements and that's another issue that to play\nSome states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example it in um Kentucky [noise] okay\nYeah I went to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones in their states that have a say in it they're just in the state legislatures are due to but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nWhere would I Do to 'em but like tying it to I guess the federal government money would there be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the arguments that are opponents of I'm expanding Medicaid I'm One of the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee you can't guarantee the states that that funding will be there forever [noise]\nUm so they their their argument is that if states get dependent on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to its bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion than states you're going to be on their own\n...
