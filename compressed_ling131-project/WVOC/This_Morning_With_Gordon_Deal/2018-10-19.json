minutes\nWine once in a whole lot of the house of it's the last thing he does the retiring house speaker is hitting the trail for an aggressive final stretch of campaigning in an attempt to help more than two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza ... got the scoop was what do we know\nHe's had a really aggressive final sprint he's like he's going to twelve state he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always have a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read lots and lots of money for the party he's raised seven eight million dollars\nFor the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates\nSafer attempt to keep these candidates have because he certainly doesn't he's not running again I'm keeping an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of just you know basically like a ... a day on multiple districts and\nIt just go kind of on his final spent that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like the if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nJeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his yard\nYeah this is really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and\nFrom there and it has to be there for a truck conservative far rate members of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually sunk legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough\nUm Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen goats in order to pass anything and they can do right now on their own um\nBut they need buy in from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races so\nTo speak with allies Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates that will kind of messaging well he does or does it change from Canada to Canada\nSo it will change from candidate to Canada what he'll do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be they said like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership I'm at the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely um groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push to this giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny tiny little bells all grouped together is a lot of vulnerable Republicans had their names on those bills so I'll be campaigning on all of that but the message\nBasically being you're better off under Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey say are going further and further last\nOr how will he use President Trump is vital\nWell I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist she said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere\nRent payments that none of them are counted out but these districts where the
