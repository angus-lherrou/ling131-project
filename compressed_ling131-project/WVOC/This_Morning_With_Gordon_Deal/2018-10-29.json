difficult it can be for delivery companies\nTo detect dangerous items before they reached their destination all the packages containing the devices so far have been identified as suspicious and they've been intercepted by law enforcement authorities before they were delivered to their intended targets which include\nFormer President Obama no one has been harmed here's Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today Nathan helps opposite to screen\nUltimately a lot of these pictures aren't screened at all or when there's just so many packages and throughout the U.S that it's very difficult for them to actually you know apply X ray scanners for example to see what's inside every single one\nIs it just uh the volume I think there's you said there's something like thirty four million packages a day they're delivered\nYeah and that's only UPS and FedEx doesn't even count the U. S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages\nGoing through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to put a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages I'm\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThis thinking about this is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the the the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts in show [noise]\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package it has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this or you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that to put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened and thoughts of ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak um and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up and these facilities as we speak but UPS\nAnd FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the service has investigators who have deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these\nPackages go through but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know it's just\nThe value is just so significant that it's tough to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so\nAnd the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these and also the private and private companies are\nI think you know really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a tech didn't ski [laughter] you know it's like Eighteen years to track down or where he was of course in those packages for of course spread out over much longer period of time and the one that we're talking about here\nBut I Do think that

Street journal reporter Joshua dreamers and Joshua what do we have\nWell basically what you've got ... got\nA mixture of factors that are playing a lot of races around the country I'm the chief from being that the Republican incumbents and the district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between\nA long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago and a brand new political candidate first time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's where she will play on districts across the country where there are these suburban\nWomen voters who are ... that risk of losing and the thing about this district which occur outside of Seattle is\nIs a GOP when we use those ... set a faster clip than um the district was recently redrawn and faster than the voters can keep up with the Republican [noise] um so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs\nI'm voting for Barbara updates like her perform and if they can keep them in the fold then that's where the Democrats have a problem in this district\n... let me come above polling indicated helping out\nA ... inch up on on both sides I surely the first time so both sides are convinced that it's going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where um it's really about who can mobilize voters that most and we're seeing in polls that a national polls that Democrats are more energized than Republicans\n[laughter] um and that's kind of trend of like\nAll right so ah the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's uh this is Kim Schrier\nController okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff\nThat's right I mean she using that as a direct appeal to people who\nAre nervous about their health care costs but seeing their costs to go up um and\nAh who have pre existing conditions [laughter] um and she feels from directly as a pediatrician in their community um\nShe's got a thousand patients that are in that district um she appeals from after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition [noise] uh and uh he's the guy was part of her pledged to support that provision of Obamacare\nBut it's a very direct appeal [noise] um that Democrats in Washington state and in the capital believe maker buried a compelling candidate\nAnd speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Joshua ... is ... outside Seattle ... election battle between the countryside and new Serbia it's the eighth district there the Republican Dino Rossi his his issue is what do you think he's been driving in particular\nTaxes or he's actually one of the Republican from they pass the expo last year they thought that it was going to be the number one issue on the campaign trail and below the actually because the district is so affluent feels that he can actually be on message on this and\nHe has tried to be in that is number one thing I Want canvassing with some of his tears and that is the thing that they push that on his fires that has a stump speeches [laughter] um and the\nPower of this district is will that be enough to keep 'em some of these Republicans in the fold or will they reflect to send a check on Donald Trump to wash\nCars this is a long held Republican district\nHas was drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the sense of [noise] um in Nineteen eighty and it has never sent a Democrat to Washington or [noise] um but even\nThough it has that can keep that in congressional races attentive of Democrats for president Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by about three points\nAnd a mistrial or you said is getting support actually from Seattle or should not have voters right\nIt's really interesting I was trying I was out there and I was trying to talk to people that live in a person who lived in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle [laughter] um and that's common um you see that in other races where people [noise] um even sometimes cross state lines to get a ticket entering foods they volunteer and all my money [noise]\nUm so this is just another example of that where people in Seattle you know their districts are reliably democratic and if they want to be a part of the blue wave [laughter]\nWhat they think will be a blue wave I keep hearing about it on TV and the way they can get to go to the swing district
