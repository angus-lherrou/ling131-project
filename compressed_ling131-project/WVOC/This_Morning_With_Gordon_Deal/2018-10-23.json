{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And I think that's really one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's school reform\nMatory yeah we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you\nSure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a following Renault but anyway uh\nMy father died and three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out the you know to put two kids\nAnd just before daylight woke up my father was there you came in her bedroom sit down on a bed mom suit up\nHer daughter kiss through and said honey everything's gonna be All right\nBut it's beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith a sweet mhm so these sometimes these stories are just emotional as well or if they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it's been in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nKnow sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one\nAnd and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that there's sometimes paranormal experiences are used as coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary it's\nNot like that in real life sort of joined the Bronx I chose to go ahead George how are you Joe good I'm Brendan yeah I\nWanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\nThe the um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental undo channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously is to supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a closely operation appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience a half the my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related this story before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day\nOr at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall um can you may be elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this or does your does your brother pass away or who he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a ... a ... before you have the extra maybe maybe\nBe maybe a fourteen years okay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check buying the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and a communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation the resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information at the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and he had this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured\nAnd you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up cars finds a dog\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprinted\nUh the study is available at Barnes and
