like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes\nI Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the plowed shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold often they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto\nThe road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um you\nKnow I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those sim woods\nWhere I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated this sound\nI'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast it would be audiotape they used to play a visual legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George and or used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame would it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big put my feet dimensional\nMight how the extra terrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods but more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and hindsight I'm just glad they

played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to for national forest is a lot of ill or between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watch the stars and hanging out and know\nLikely music stuff sometimes I just kind of hanging out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around her hours up there and we went down to look and stars through binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about it as\nBest as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else has had this experience but um it was kind of like hey what are you doing up here and and I\nGot a second guessed it but [noise] oil it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out and look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic him personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd may I jump to the microscope is got out of there um and\nYou know I never really piece together what was you know I'm like I said I Will do a lot of reading ... coast the and this year or so it was like oh my God that is what it is it has a you know musicians like listen to

more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aids security there were really not in a much of a different shape than we weren't you doesn't sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aids by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what did he just did prior to two dozen fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what is being does it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um\nThe servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do the remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing supper really believe that we know about that I'm also have a patch of elbow\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch that system\nSo they did that to a few states before um the ... and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet facing system not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the Internet not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's also not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also use to tabulate devote so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think that the\nOkay so if you're if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about\nWhether or not we could be hacked\nOr there has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the hackers for going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't though\nAs you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nShow 'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballot today at all those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter that are in cyber security journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential

that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount and so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of\nAre ... and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any paper at all and that's how we got we

never defaults in repackage them into securities to make them seem risk list\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use the it\nGot to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to that\nOf the risk weather was bankers who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we're individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we had the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's all it's been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting you wrote household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't year we'd build one and a half million new homes\nAnd its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm wearing aging country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house I and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and\nYou can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have\nTo get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we the investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted [laughter] you don't have as many people going to start their own business and partly because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your bagels here and you realize there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people want is to not stuck next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being formed is actually historically quite low I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nOr speaking with ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean\nOnce we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or are they related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry that is to say if everybody pessimistic there is nobody that fully invested\nAnd therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ... and fell into that so in some sense pessimism is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nIn that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like you've got to bust in a recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that this ... is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off I don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but about which\nThe risk to start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've had a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk to have a kind of like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier try to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like have lead headed companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense still have rich got there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system would be safer as a result\n...
