competing\nAdvertisements representing an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker words Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News in particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs from over at the Fox business channel until the general public's notice this until have lobbyists and easy and lobbyist had\nFound that are in effect of way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\n... like a fern what example whose airing what\nWell we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight to that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and then group said also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same program\nIs you know to be influenced by the\nWay we can see is that he does and gauge sometimes directly after\nAn ad that popped up on TALK on this happened to win a group of a U.S steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up the president started talking about the issued suggesting that he had seen the ad um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last\nYear billionaire Tom's dire who constantly in fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noted that and tweeted about it right away\nSpeak with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong dealership um during the administration the viewership has a red and and so have the ad rates and we've actually seen some lobby from\nYou know noted that not only is the president watching these shows but people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wind but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president\nHas expressed a dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that the people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him well\nThat that that sounds I guess along the lines of what the guy Kevin Mac from that group need to impeach how he feels like he just suspect that the president's watching and knows he can targeting what's with like a little elbow and the ribs kinda bad\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting to hear the president has been a very disparaging of\nSaturday Night live as a show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but

twenty five and a few hours but we are on the western side of what is now I have very very big hurricane Michael and the western shine for people who don't watch it is that\nIf there is a thing is the good side right so that northeast quadrant of any hurricane or its impact area that's the worst side to be on and the north west side if there is a good side that is the better when in other words the witness fall apart quickly you have less issue with storm surge\nAnd it's just the uh the drier side as well of a storm show we're actually on that side where so many people have come out of the Florida Panhandle to be as close as they came to their homes but still be safe we had seen a day's worth a whole twenty four hours of a massive shift to people from Florida Panhandle in the southwest Alabama\nWow do you have the ability to accommodate all those folks\nBut I think we're full now but but will show figure out that areas like Baldwin county which is one of the\nTwo counties that make

of it than it next allergic comes up towards the mogul river comes into the bay and we're ... and that could give you an issue with surge but once again lucky for us being on the west side\nOr wind issues going to be really bad but north today show which areas to the east of the storm that will get that\nOn short but we saw Gordon Moore the shore float yesterday as Michael was still further out in the Gulf and we saw\nWater levels three to four feet above normal yesterday and today I have a feeling that will be lower because the storm is now going to be the swing wins from the north towards us but you know it's it's eerie being here because waking up this morning I went to bed last night this was a category three we're doing a very significant hurricanes waking up to a category four\nAnd
