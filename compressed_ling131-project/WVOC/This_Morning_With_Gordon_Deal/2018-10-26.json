I don't know a few years back\nYeah I think it was just before the into doubt the sixty before the election in early twenties Seventeen we had a series at rice and being bailed people\nAnd rice and seem to be the male of choice for more than a couple of years 'cause if you remember right after nine eleven I think there was something that would be bailed out too\nAnd then here probably five six years ago there was a bunch and that it never really call down\nSo what do you do I mean how do you protect yourself if you think you might be targeted in some way shape or form with something suspicious in the mail\nWell the first thing you need to do is look at the ... or whatever it is you're going to get in the mail or by delivery service and she who is sending it to you if you're not expecting a package from that individual\nThen you probably should call them ... ... email whatever the case may be and say hey you sent me an act of something and if they say no and there is a different side is something wrong with the packages that had been mailed to CNN and all the political\nFigures you know the name the return address was wrong her name which uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz

attention to the delivery person if it's not the same\nYou might want to raise a flag of caution\nRight now and obviously you know the package delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in\nBut it it has been my experience\nIn the past that the delivery people coming into office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day unless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know it may you know where's second such\nYou know if they said on vacation or she's on vacation that you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they cited it I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah then there could be an issue with that because they're trying to get out of the building as fast as they possibly can\nAre these days um most of us are in this see something say something mode hopefully right but if there's something that I don't know it just strikes you as odd what do you do you call nine one one right away you alert building security line and what's what's the political\nWell I Would\nMore than likely call your Security Department first or whatever happened to be in charge of security I mean if you're in an office job of building\nIt may not have a dedicated security team there so call your age are person first and let them make the decision to call if you're working in a manufacturing plant then you you know you don't want to call the security there and more than likely they're going to get a call nine one one\nAnd most of the

sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start and uh you know people here have seen that across the board\nFor us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so this is something that yeah we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but he didn't you know\nCar carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nSo to speak of Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic had aids the central dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nYou got a piece about how Phoenix has just been

it it's a compared to the midterms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what we're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage growing political value or on the board\nOr Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's so far lighter she knew these days Democrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters and a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call\nAnd so we are just a you know inundated with these ads are overwhelmingly negative and a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the ... the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have\nAs much financial power to do it so at any price they would have been relatively low rock came a campaign you know we have a Democrat running for example one in each House Ways ah they are challenging guts move for us and ah these are some times you know budget affairs\nAre we even have to Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod ... so you know they are at least a contest to lean choices\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from it have ETV money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps
