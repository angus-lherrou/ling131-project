reporter Jacob bungee in Chicago Jacob what are you hearing\nYou got to remember that but there's still a real tense situation going on with China which is as big a market as as a Mexico and Canada nearly in terms of agricultural exports are\nDefinitely a big buyer of soybeans which has been kind of the root of a lot of the headache and the heartland here this year is this a try to put on those tariffs a couple of months back\nSo this goes a long way towards like we said or remove some of the the big question mark round the north American market and and that is very important you know just the proximity Alexa\nSo much in a way of agricultural goods be exported directly across those borders in particular you know meat products so on but there's still a lot of question marks out there for the rest of the globe in Europe as there's another one I've been working on\nA man and you know China obviously it's going to need to be resolved and for the time being looks like it's getting more tense an outlet so to\nSpeak with Wall Street journal reporter Jacob bungee he's written a piece titled us farmers welcome new North American trade pact I'm from a food safety standpoint what's new on that front\nWhere you've got here is a not a man massive change in the way that this is on but they modernize some of the language and tried to standardize some of the practices across the three different markets and as you can imagine this is a\nSensitive topic ah people not just\nHaving to have confidence in their own country's food safety assessments but also you know wanting the most certainty that the practices and Mexico and Canada are going to be up to snuff and the U.S and by and large to the the us has taken\nThe view that that these things are a reliable and then the other countries it depends on the product and and there's a range of things but\nYeah the last time this language was a really updated was something there twenty three years ago and so\nThere's been a lot of advancement of in that time as you can imagine a the food industry here in the U.S and particular as it was taken out of bigger or policing some of these things which is you know it's only debate but this is why one of the\nKey things that they worked out here and to to do with the food safety front\n... I I I think there was somebody in your stories of something along the lines that there seems to be momentum right now for the American farmer on the trade front is that this is that a widely held belief\nWell I think it depends who you ask and probably or how they're have their bank account is broken right now you know depending on on what type of a proper or livestock they produce and and how much they've been hit by lower prices but a\nA comment about momentum came from a place where you know the farmers on the farm sector this goes for the agricultural companies to they've been watching any better years' worth the headlines are and things have been going in a direction where there is more a question\nIn terms of the U.S and its relationship with his major trading partner is you know Mexico Canada or the China and so on\nAnd ah so the reference that momentum there was a trade deal an updated thing that a President Trump signed last week with South Korea\nWhich is a significant market and then in Asia for us agricultural and food exports\nAnd uh the announcements with Mexico came before that a few weeks time and now with Canada looking like they're going to\nShore up the the NAFTA or as an after that was and move forward with something and so that's a reference to momentum as been after you know ... quite a few months here of uncertainty\nWhere this all is going there there are seeing some resolution to some of these things\nAnd ...
