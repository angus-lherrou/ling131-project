the spinal muscular atrophy\nHigh impact our friend or a friend Adam and his son Leo I might be familiar with ah Leo's pride great organization that is that is having an impact internationally on children and families said that have had\nThe difficult decision of a child who was diagnosed with add an a and well we're talking about kids in a very similar however different types of selection and that is polio a polio haven't been eradicated from the United states or at least at\nLeast being diagnosed in originating in the U.S in Nineteen Seventy nine I surprisingly there are there are surprisingly few cases left new original cases left in the world\nSay surprisingly because it would seem that is so small it would not take much to knock disappointment out unfortunately I it is still prevalent in some areas where to learn more about polio what it is what's being done and where exactly are there still is a risk\nOf polio and if you're a perhaps I have I have a couple of miles on you you may remember things like the pool scarce where you you didn't want to swim if there was somebody who had contracts polio very interesting conversations will have this morning on Carolina cares we'll start that off in just a couple of minutes do you not most\nMajor key alert don't ever put yourself like this like ... you will be testing so pass it\nMove real major key to getting the coverage that get schools ... stay focused on that show major killer throws you buy get school to be a council [noise]\nLooking back to Carolina cares my name is ... and this morning we're talking about a very special foundation that was boring\nOut of I probably some of the most heartbreaking knew you could get into a story of of inspiration for a young family joining me this morning the president of Leo's pride foundation now I'm going to put your name I'm gonna try it Adam but didn't ski nailed it Tyler didn't really have\nTo listen to all the years of playing sports growing up I've heard that name many different ways I had to really sell my wife on accepting that as a last name but she got it right\nI Love I Love it I really look let's go and jump right in a ... pride Ali's pride surrounds foundation surrounding um infliction I guess a diagnosis of essay may which is spinal muscular atrophy I'm not a doctor and you kind of explaining what estimate is yes\nA spinal muscular atrophy in a very quick way that we laid out a lot of times it's like a a lesson adults but in children it's a muscle wasting condition in Tyler just\nYou and I'm standing here today the reason we're standing here today is because we have an S. him in one gene is their survival motor neuron gene in that gene is responsible for creating a protein that allows our body are muscles to thrive\nA person is diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy\nTypically does not have that at some in one gene and so therefore when the proteins aren't being created through this gene arm or motor neuron started die off and that's what creates muscle wasting in these kids and in these adults\nRight and I just and you think about it than your muscles are when you move away but somebody pick up a pen that's all your\nInterest on your mostly Muslim what to do and yet you lack that peace maybe thinking move and doesn't\nMove absolutely the ... and ... and then you've hit on a really good piece their estimate is not affect the brain you know when we got this diagnosis really uh we were three weeks into being brand new parents and we had every thought of what life was going to be like for us and\nAnd things change one of the real really great things that came to us in that news with estimate does not affect the brain so while the body has debilitating issues at a deals with because of this condition the brain is not impacted in and said today Lee is taking Spanish class as an almost fifth grader in his kindergarten so\nWell let's let's back up a step than an email we talked about Laos pride but there's a reason why you know much about it and that's an extra some Leo I diagnose you should three weeks after birth\nYet we're diagnose three weeks after birth I'm married and I we grew up out in shape and we just moved back home back home to shape and we're planning this life and in Libya was born in and we knew right away that there was something going on and like any parent does any person does when you're concerned you start looking things up and everything on that list started leading us towards this diagnosis so\nWhen we got the diagnosis we uh we really did go back home and then\nFor for you know the best way to describe it shuttered the doors and windows and and just really drew in close to the family and tried to wrap our minds around what was life going to be like how does this happen to us um and I got to tell you that was a really short period of time because\nWe realized that we had this incredible gift that God has given us this opportunity to be parents this and really just this beautiful little boy that needed us to be strong needed us to make good decisions\nAnd so we just said this isn't how we're gonna live we're going to be happy we are going to go out and we're going to pursue life in a way that we would want any of any child that we have to be able to pursue life and\nThe cool thing is is we got an incredible family that surrounds us we've got an incredible community that surrounds this where every time we say hey here's what we want to do they say yeah we'll go do it with you or will support you in making that happen\nAnd Leo is your first child how many how many now siblings as he absolutely\nHas got a little sister named evade or a ... going to be turned in eleven months old and she has been you know it's interesting we we've had lived for for almost five years now and you know you and I were talking earlier when you get a diagnosis the initial prognosis that was given to us for Leo was eight months to two years\nAnd say you like how how we got a cramped things ended a short amount of time but leaves turning five now coming up at his race and and now he's got a little sister that's ten months old and as parents we've had this really unique opportunity to have\nTwo different parenting experiences one that's very much centered that is no different than anybody you just love your children love your children\nBut we've had this opportunity to really be there and support and challenge and pushing and\nHave this unique experience of being a parent of a child with a difficult diagnosis a child with special needs and now we have ... there was a typically developing child and she we have no doubt it's going to grow up to be somebody that is going to be Leo's advocate Leo's staunch supporter if somebody's going to fight for him and\nUm but to be able to see both sides of parenting it's nice to be able to see what really centers on what our foundation truly pushes for every kid thrives the same way you treat them with love you treat them with dignity and respect and you just give them opportunities to be kids\nIt's the same for adults you give us an opportunity to be part of things and and that's what we want\nRight but what what leads up to that diagnose it as that may I mean is it hereditary as it is it just something that that happens I you know there's there's so many things you know if you smoke ten packs of cigarettes a day going to get lung cancer that just you know that just kind of eight plus beagles hey\nIs there anything that would have given you concern initially in the pregnancy\nYou know now that we're educated parents within this condition yeah we could look back on it and married would tell you that she did noticed there was reduced fetal movement that looking back on it and maybe there's things that she could have picked up on but as a brand new parents in because this is a genetic condition it's auto sawmill recessive meaning that we both have to be carriers of a defective gene\nIn order to be affected with a condition\nSo looking back on it yeah we could say there's some things that we could have seen during pregnancy but I Would have been so tough to think is new parents\nAnd I would have stopped and it it wouldn't have changed the the eventual mental bride I diagnose see the ...\nWhen it changed the diagnosis Leo is going to be born at that point with us in may I'm the one in fifty people are carriers of the defective estimate gene so if you've got a hundred people in a room to people in that room or or or carriers married and I went to shape in high school I graduated with a hundred and Seventy kids she might have had two hundred kids in her class so you think\nYou know here's a small town and these kids meet each other they they manage to\nFind their way through life and get married and have children so that the odds are are extremely rare this happening however it's considered the\nUh it's it's a it's an orphan disease a rare disease but it's kind of common it's the number one cause of genetic mortality in in kids kids under the age of two and a you know we talked about that initial pregnant as a\n... so you I ... I think it's a hundred percent natural reaction whether a diagnosis of breast cancer or is it man in your newborn\nEat exactly what I think I Would do a lot of people you've just\nYou'd think nobody else give only to this what are we going to do you go home your circle the wagons in exactly said he ... he said it didn't last very long because also now you've you've got the foundation and the ... pride so tiny kind of how that how that came about I mean obviously you know you you open the shatters and said hey this is us right\nYeah and you know we've got friends the way the way that we as probably foundation came about was was not mayor thrive saying we want a foundation to go out and help families like ours what happened is in the first year of ... life we had doctors appointments as you can imagine we're going\nWe're driving to Wisconsin were driving to to do and\nAs we're doing all this we're doing it without the aid of a medically accessible vehicle to safely transport Leo because he requires\nSpecific harnessing to be safe as he's traveling right and we had some friends and family decided they wanted to have a five K they wanted to raise money they wanted to buy us a medically accessible bands that Leo in his wheelchair could safely go everywhere he needed to go to\nTruly be able to get back out and have adventures pursue life like any any little boy and a little kid would want to", "show_name": "Carolina Cares", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "28"}
