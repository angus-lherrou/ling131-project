I'm standing here today the reason we're standing here today is because we have an S. him in one gene is their survival motor neuron Jean and that machine is responsible for creating a protein that allows our body are muscles to thrive ...\nA person is diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy\nTypically does not have that at some in one gene and so therefore when the proteins are being created through this gene our ... our motor neurons start to die off and that's what creates muscle wasting in in these kids and it needs to do what's\nRight and that just and you think about it than your muscles are when you move away but somebody pick up a pen that's all your ... your muscle you must know what to do when you elect that peace maybe thinking move and doesn't milk\nAbsolutely the and
