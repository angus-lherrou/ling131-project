but South Carolina and certainly Columbia has an immense amount of history a within it and a lot of history you can still actually step in to be a part of a it's more than just going to uh to me the missing a display you can really become a part of history and that is with historic Colombia\nAnd we're speaking this morning with James ... with the store Columbia and ... good morning to you both good morning thanks for having a good morning you didn't dress apart I was hoping you'd come in and some like period pieces but no huh no such luck not for today although it is radio I could've said

store Columbia just a a a gym of great I I guess or exhibits but they're probably more than that but tell us James about historic Columbia\nYeah we're really just all about sharing the history of our community and talking about different ways that people can explore history and uh provide context to the way that our community is taking shape and where it might be going in the future\nNow where uh where are some of us say exhibits but I guess your house is your ... where where where's your footprint and put it that way\nYeah so the site so we actually manage or in downtown Columbia so we managed six historic sites as well as the gardens that are on those grounds as well um but we also do lots of programs on the community you're going to see our staff and volunteers throughout all of Richland\nCounty and Colombia sure we can give me the money give me the history of historic Columbia how 'bout that were ... how'd you that started the group how how do you go about acquiring these homes that have such significant relevance to history\nYeah we'll historical me astounded in Nineteen sixty one specifically by a group of volunteers to save the rubber mills house which is one of our museums today\nAnd over the next several decades our foot ... footprint grew and so\nUh after several years a fundraising and the actual preservation of the robber milk house and when it finally opened as a museum as historic house museum\nWe then kind of continue to expand a little bit over time we also now manage the Hampton Preston mansion which is just right across the street the Woodrow Wilson family home a museum of reconstruction as well as the man Simon site so those are kind of our foreign museums that are open for daily tours and then we have a couple of other historic sites that are\nUsed for various purposes weddings rentals other events things like that\nRight and these properties are are truly amazing truly restored I guess to their\nOriginal glory or some blurry day I mean obviously if they have a long period of time you you pick a period of time which they represent\nYes so with the different historic sites we certainly um we\nWe look at the periods of sickness I always say oh this or decide when was that when I was very very I was really really crucial to the national ... history and inexperienced left here and there but we also try to try to make sure that our visitors somewhere where of just how that how how that if I had\nI had a shape to ever have for example an acting program as everybody knows everybody kind of as a as a kind of ...\nHome home a
