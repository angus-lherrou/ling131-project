C.\nStudios WVU sci fi or\nAnywhere you go on the heart radio I\nIn numbers the ... that appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAh apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nHave you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent this about it a great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support Gillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nHe's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with British citizen the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee\nAnyway you know run the Santa season a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett us it is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable but some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate ice ... open borders me\nIt's when you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront of the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texas alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nAnd then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant now it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer's dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes even his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate\nHave faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have a top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... has still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee\nMartha Black ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona where we have Dean Heller hold the seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican broad Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now has him leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence\nHave you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost Democratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment\nAt a huge crowd in Houston as well we're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and they also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got of course the hypocrisy so we got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nIn the WBRC news that their families as

Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know by a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to

the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally and he's now begun the process of cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give it to them\nBut the president's also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty\nThey're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies that allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe

you've got this caravan marching north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the border putting National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now it's almost like we're headed towards a major human confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and a president

they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more

thing they're doing which are not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nAh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd

crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell much McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about that the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else and throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his bat brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors ... big caravan issue of the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nHe's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lotta left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such a ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President because at the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better when in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started died you know\nSean short list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is a bad aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcome that never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nKnow the real danger so I don't know how this was all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders in her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety\nWe'll guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIt's you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument the other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality\nOr disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it but you don't want you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nAre very honest guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story about their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president of compassion for these people does the president that after the the answer is yes she learned at the riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are\nCollecting rent for blue collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of Trump's family which is a great American success many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh put their goal part of America that both part of the fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we look forward to it my
