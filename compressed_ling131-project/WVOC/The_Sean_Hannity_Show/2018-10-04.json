Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even polar publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that this Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yell classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case that Julie sweat Nick\nWe saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug gr and rapist of teenage girls would give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from your Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute when everybody was talking to it\nWas a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and the FBI did\nKnow skews on me why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborate it they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so could you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not too many ... and I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of ... people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that ... or that happened that way at all\nFor the church is our culture and that thing on at the last twenty four hours at camp out at the judges drinking all honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show the outline get\nSomething of course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence I Believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing itchy on hey\nI notice a talking point what was on a second\nOnce you interviewed looking in the case of professor Ford before\nPeople she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection\nOf the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen what else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI\nTo do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony and all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Daniella ... case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... the FBI just\nIs not that was can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay ... thanks to say that she doesn't run into where I where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bounds of the ... if\nThere's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know if she got home we don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she

actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a a good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain and I feel like that's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters he hadn't sold hope not [laughter] I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how

and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where

that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett
