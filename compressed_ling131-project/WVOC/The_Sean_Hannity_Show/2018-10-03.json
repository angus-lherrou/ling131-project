the FBI's supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as today they've been conducting interviews about sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh while the partisan sniping over the handling of the allegations continues\nWhat is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation you know what I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but\nWhat we do know now is that obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it\nThose that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got announced anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights\nFundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any\nChance of covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the\nCase of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about Mr ...\nMirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly it\nThat that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drugging young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues\nOf the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... no I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug ... girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped\nWomen young girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation that somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls and it's\nGotten so absurd now that yeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe's police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone at the Supreme Court [noise]\nWhy we need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves right hand truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor\nAccusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case\nAnyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly I've been no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment in Sarasota look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there's no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to\nA lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor forward but I I mean professor Ford is they'll told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee um\nJust [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sects accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor forward and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a

do we not understand how\nDeeply dangerous this is for every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil that raw power are the kinds of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh there'll only do it I Believe in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but\nIt comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Senator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that\nI I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been\nA smear treated with a vicious personal attack all those things I think I mean that the Susan Collins who was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court\nBut the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stays for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate\nTo agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos\nA continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president is set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next we got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this will actually be about which kind of America do you want us to be you want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children ... Thirteen gangs professional and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team to one's constitutional judges not radicals I think we got campaign could be\nStunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we had in two thousand seven\nWhy I mean I hear a optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly and Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember it and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do an interview Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance\nThey're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage a campaign and I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hard working decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example\nA government run health care means taxpayer abortion\nWell they're very few places in America over there is a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election night\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from the swamp from the sewer it's the Sean Hannity show by the way if you like me and you hate week week\nOn state ... more Colombian we like to\nUse radio five sixty W.

I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general is a California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do accusation that's how that person's signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um\nYou know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now examined every single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever air that interview but\nThey are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen who's truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity it is very very important that Mitt sweat Nick\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats Deborah cats by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended in in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ...

assault witness Leyland Kaiser her lifelong girlfriend\nSeeing for the first time as close family member confirmed she did not corroborate school friend Ford story to the FBI\nAnd where are we looking Leland Kaiser was seen for the first time\nKaiser fifty to foreign described as your best friend and holding my arms preparatory school and besides the Marilyn was her final hope for cooperation however the former pro golfer couldn't corroborate Ford story when she was interviewed by the FBI on Saturday I Believe this is Bob Beck walls ex wife by the way\nPictured in daily mail TV exclusive photos for the first time since news of Ford named her Kaiser showed the stress of being put into the national spotlight\nThe closest relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion the Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quotes significant health challenges and why aren't the uh media all worked up about how Dr Ford through a fellow female Cleveland Kaiser under the bus\n\nShe can't remember it because of significant health challenges\nTo health challenges have not impaired her memory\nBut being caught up in the cabinet scandal has proved physically trying to her the relatives

that renovation at her home\nWith the two doors the two front or I just thought it was odd the whole thing came up\n\nWell it's kind of odd people have looked into this real clear investigations looked\nInto this don't they found that second door wasn't there for an exit that second or lead to a refurbished room in a bathroom where businesses were run out of it\nOr the room could have been rent it so that ruin was created with that door\nNot because of any er psychological issues or difficulties\nPaul ... points that are real clear investigations\nNo it was created as another form of a of income\nYou start adding things that these things up it really does create a problem doesn't in Mr producer\n\nI mean you go through this one thing after another after another and of course now they're indignant but but yep yeah I did interview Kavanaugh why she's going to change your opinion\nThat argument doesn't even make sense why is she going to change your opinion of the FBI that can be perjury I don't think she'll do that and I didn't even interview judge Kavanaugh well why should they is he going to change his opinion I don't think so\nAll we need to get into the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did interview\nDr Ford then they should take with them\nProsecutor Rachel Mitchell's memo and as well as several the points I've been raising and then have Dr Ford square the circle\nThat would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Canada but I don't see any contradictions in his testimony deal\nI really don't\nI don't think you have a lot of ex Kavanaugh girlfriends coming forward and saying a while he lied about this and he lied about that and now that's not true\nHe did like the fly and er he wasn't claustrophobic and I did this and he did that there's nobody who's said that\nWell you have this old guy what he said he threw ice\n\nMe through ice [noise] luckily didn't throw a lab or an ashtray I like Hillary Clinton [noise]\n\nThe FBI or are we allowed to talk about the truth anymore and my ... I had a dear friend is a dear friend he wrote me he said you need to be careful about this stuff I said I'm being careful and not being mean I'm not being rude I'm just laying it out\n[noise] the way I say [noise] on the other hand the Republicans at stake the Supreme Court just saying I'm not going to allow him not gonna hide under the table and I'll be right back [noise] why don't we [laughter]\nConditions of the officer is not yet known doctors Steve Rapaport has more live\nWhatever your feelings about it there's no escaping that fact\nAnd to have a party or in one point of our history where its primary objective was to protect slavery another time in its history its primary objective was to protect segregation\n\nA war fought over slavery\n\nRiots in the war is if you will domestically photo where segregation\n\nThen they claim the mantle of civil rights when it's the Republican Party that oppose\nSlavery or the post segregation those were not a Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone\n\nThey didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset of nullification you can see it was ... cities secession you can see it in California with the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democratic party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democratic party cannot survive if the nation is United what is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity\n\nThat is made up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion\nBased on income based on age\nAnd so forth and so and it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we tried to discuss the constitution of the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance their cause whether they win elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the early progressive tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have temporary control over the instruments ... of government but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard eyes the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government in this massive administrators state\nSo even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win when they win elections they tell you they have a mandate so they never lose\nWhat an Obama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority of the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats did vote\n\nYesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\n\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands\nWhat did they get that information\nWhere did they get that information is is a civil liberties union we are forced to file federal income taxes we were forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages\nThat boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed to\nA electronically and provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office eternity general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great wealth you've never seen the peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of you are familiar with New York city aren't you\nAll those buildings with the president's name on he created this\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and but for his father he couldn't succeed\nThey're so concerned about that and they go on about how he he's a tax cheat first of all as I understood it these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks cheat now has he been adjudicated attacks street administratively or traditionally no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually filing own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\n\nAnd of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted as used underwear member that Mr producing\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing they haven't build the damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHaving all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nThe New York times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the SBA an jak multiple times or Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick and an molested so many other women now it's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it it's the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remember Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSort of this big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate it everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times\nThe New York times is always right don't you know the New York times is never\nWrong\nWe have ah the economy of the mayor of a New York city they went to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of New York that's what he said Donald Trump created thousands and thousands of jobs in New York\nDemocrats privately have told T PM in recent days that they saw an uptick in GOP interest\nAnd intensity and the days leading up to the Kavanaugh hearings and they tightening in polls in states where the candidates had held wider leaves those some say

he's a left wing Democrat\nDevin Nunes has a secret the article begins so what is this politically explosive secret must be a big one right well no this secret isn't secret at all and it's also entirely irrelevant newness comes from a farming family in the San Joaquin Valley of California\nSo it was a lot of family in California who have farms and include on the farm or including the farm he
