that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool\nOh beta O'Rourke it's it it is they out\nSide taxes phenomenon

rock is a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate a yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the\nSecretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and\nGet an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using\nIn this I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above so they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their ... and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful now the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one but the way I see it Eighteen days out\nIs that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight

on Fox News dot com and\nThe headline is her husband is accused of abuse by his ex wife anyway was reportedly accused of domestic violence and Missouri candidates a Claire McCaskill has been accused

is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time\nBut the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better\nIn a in a in the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a sort of ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to go on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nOr just really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nUh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite showing I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those ... raise it above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nThen I was an absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate\nOr if you can motivate those Republicans to come out those Trump voters those independents and Democrats has supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I Am

any Democrat you're voting for pillow see if you stay home it's a half a vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know Brett us and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're going to they're going to tow the line with below sea in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it anymore John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this one open borders sanctuary

that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most of the survey right now the

getting there had been recording to that effect\nOr not live according to that effect sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gas for some sort of outraged the outrage of the day a Democrat is accusing Jerry cushion or of ordering the hit\nThis guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince a ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand about\nThis he's one of their stars ... the Democrats win the house\nTwo and a half weeks from today\nAnd he is in the leadership\nI mean he's he's he's a rising star ... they're going to give him power more power than he has right now this guy who is peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely debunked unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television\nAnd accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist the ... could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power\nNow that this may not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of our country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama the UC play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly he has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that kind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo

the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the print then may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action again [noise] circus oj\nI bet he did you hear what he just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter is how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to accused Jared Kushner\nOf calling a hit or doing anything untoward are delivering this information well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming ... I mean and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast\nA website which is which is a left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah\nBlah blah blah blah and of course there's no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro uh I understand your statement saying that you didn't intend\nCan you tell us what you didn't tend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what just said and and and here's the best part of his denial\nNever got any follow up and never got any challenging as just accept it oh well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his word they didn't intend to it he then said all I said was there was reporting to the effect that Jared Kushner may have\nNet and Congress needs to investigate I you see and now and now\nThat's that's the crux of it because\nThey didn't see everything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you're seeing on cable news night after night after night all of it has to do with the midterm election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nBy officials with the Saudi Government the way they are all react that\nHas everything to do with the mid term elections the caravan as they're calling it a thousands of Hondurans Salvadorans Guatemalans waving their flags and marching across Mexico to illegally cross our border and stay here in this country because they believe they deserve to be here\nAnd we can't do anything about it that has everything to do with the mid term elections\nAnd I in king Castro's non denial denial via Twitter he revealed something that you need to understand because this is the next two years of our lives if the Democrats when\nHe said it's being reporting it's being reported that Jared Kushner did this and therefore Congress needs to investigate\nDr Christine Blasey Ford comes forward with an allegation that has no corruption ration any witness that she names refugees her story\nAnd certainly can't confirm her story it's thirty five years old and nothing anything close to the allegations she made against now justice Kavanaugh had ever been made up until this point but what did the Democrats say what how\nThe allegation is out there and it's very serious so it needs to be investigated in fact we need an FBI investigation and it needs to take weeks\nAnd weeks and not liking cash dry out with and it's being reported so it needs to be investigated and that's\nThe next two years of your life well the New York times is reporting this so it needs to be investigated the Huffington Post is not reported this I don't know if it's true or not but it's very serious\nIt needs to be investigated [noise]\nI think Republicans if they're smart and Jews let's be clear the jury is out on that they

Harvey Weinstein in many ways because he gave the all the right causes and\nAnd donated all all the right of feminist politicians so he could you could wear the mantle of feminists Harvey wouldn't do that he loves women after all he donates to Planned Parenthood which is\nThe most despicable statement one could ever make if you really love and care about women the last thing you would do is give money to Planned Parenthood but that's how the left thinks that's how Hollywood things\nAnd the me too movement as it it came forward under Harvey Weinstein and some of the other allegations of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and they're all Democrats have you noticed there all liberals they're all they're all in the media for that matter\nBut what they had in common that we didn't see it in the Kavanaugh a proceedings was that there was immediately floodgates opened of other valid corroborated\nCompletely credible allegations what we saw with Kavanaugh were a couple of other allegations you know led by the likes of Michael ...\nThere were completely on credible\n... locked any corroboration that lack any consistency but what you saw with the cabin up thing was the politicization of the me too movement you saw me to used as a political weapon to destroy somebody because ultimately they didn't like their\nPolitics it was just the last quiver in their ... wait the last arrow in their quiver you know what I mean\nIt was the last weapon at their disposal they tried everything else got no it was during those confirmation hearings and this one they secretly surreptitiously held back and then throw it out there\nAs their final attack that's all it was and it was despicable and it was dishonorable and it went against everything that we in America stand for innocent until proven guilty due process\nAnd when I talked to women they were outraged at the Democrats about that and then something happened\nFirst of all Democrats aren't talking about it anymore which tells me you know they get it and they think that this is a loser for them if they spend too much time money focusing on it but then I I mentioned that I'm from Michigan My brother and one of my brother's still

getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nThan it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious\nWay and it terrifies the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they
