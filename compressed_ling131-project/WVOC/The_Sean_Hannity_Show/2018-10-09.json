and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency as only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot are new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation these kept his promise on building the wall isn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lowest African American unemployment record low women and in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises\nOn ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards\nTo that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipeline or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think you know Nancy Pelosi's\nPick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know that just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case that our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was that if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet an issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James cone may\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney\nRemember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat then went out and hire the former ... six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside and anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm\nGave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that's done in terms of\nWhat it reveals since uh directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the Pfizer warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dusty eight that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nYou know Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\n\n[noise] we have a government

scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nUh and there was a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of starting the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I say I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf but a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think so\nThis is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three to four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area that weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit that North Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember showing last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern one Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and say well what does that have to do with us well when the action stops there like I did last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to camp out or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know I'd been shown knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with or it's this is going right in between and instead of coming western North West it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force\nAlong the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Colombia or Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThe security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are now also locking down it's all good for\nThe

corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker said it\nBaker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nA pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS in our

corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used when our understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we

Smith directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenties sixteenth election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at the FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the the OJ and the FBI I've sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and Greg Jarrett continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Jared\nGot out a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton\nCollusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document based on supposed Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation is spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along computer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight to ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nAnd what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of doc ah docks were patient care foundation you know now that we have\nHave alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either in southwest Florida a practice of health are pissed when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create obstacles blocks us when we were ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas coming down medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not to say anything bad about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots wondering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the other products\nSo an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the hoops ticket it authorized\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nOf them that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock to gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nA for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the politician there has in California is to send him an originality destroying more money at the problem has never fixed it\nWhat we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a bit you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us is how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so something ... just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model\nAlready does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor ... denied them service\nThat everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness how did\nYou get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance we can\nLower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take your do your kind of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can\nWrite a quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... was empty and Dr Lee as grows president docks for a patient care foundation\nThe were pressured leadership ... past events coming up on Wednesday October the twenty fourth write it down hosted by our friends at expressed pros dot com\nPresident Trump has nothing but praise for Haley\nShe has been [noise] at the United nations from the beginning with the vehicle and worked with us so they can have just been really a long time very intense\nHe says he'll misery hates to see her ... she says no Shelby campaigning for him in twenty twenty\nWe're in a watch and wait scenario as hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle tomorrow morning meteorologist stay here in the mid ... we should expect to feel the effect by tomorrow evening and into Thursday they predict after Thursday we should be clear Senator Lindsey Graham says he's grateful for what\nThe crowds have done the Republican senator address the ... county GOP last night and said damage during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings United Republicans like nobody else could I'm Alisa Z news radio five sixty W.

producers of the ... show to talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a with\nA course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and that's the presumption of innocence supplies and that's some substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not singing one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office that Trump's ... scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy\nThe Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harassment and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think of a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit\nHe hits back Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle\nAbout this Kavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin a further and further and further cabin all kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my model\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined that I Will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in him to fight back and no holds barred straight Pearl or fashion But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his or all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping ball to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he ... he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin Oh one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you got to fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth well she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one ever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens\nAnd the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to write for\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room\nSo the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she

oh Christine afford and by the white Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who stole his credit cards but I redress\nOr what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protect going to lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit a boyfriend and Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend\nPreparing to take us governors administer polygraph\nAnd the exam and so practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector tests\nAnd she did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford a lot about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic is actually allow\n[laughter] that's terrified because you're now take

here still found guilty of that and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back your reputation\nRight on [laughter] that would that would be on the road and wouldn't come you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such\nA thing and you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a\nOr someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to crush the new to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say what do what you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project\nHas listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho were wrongly convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry spent two black guys spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was the host or university case were for\nCollege ... men at home server chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students they came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused as someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and\nAll I'm saying is give Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied and now that the weak took ...

Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them\nWas that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water great in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency\nViolated the norms of the presidency so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency as if Obama\nAnd Bush and Clinton and Bush\nLBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me was continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to learn a thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley Raul arc that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities your wife ... any direction acreage cars as much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to regret otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me have shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz listening liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how 'bout Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker did he violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did the eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate to think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance and I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\n... and another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November I don't even remember the eight twenty sixteen that he may not get it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election and aren't haven't they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that Jeanette bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say stack\nAbout accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job is attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nBut that one Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this was abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amoral abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be tonight\nAnd and at some point the Chinese New dollars more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is a normal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nOr I'm with you and I also did tests that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAnything or not as good and that they will not nothing good that Donald Trump has done Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm aren't perfect you know he never did that so he tries he tried hard\nHard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it right ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAnd that too is sick today you know sure we got her run thank you for your call from Pennsylvania Senator Chuck Schumer which they get

Fox News hurricane Michael now a category three taking in the Gulf Coast of Florida\nIs that taking the straw lightly and neither should any family in the state\nWell every name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I I think what happened Jeannie in reality is that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help\nFor your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThe doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist has that Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that\nHappened I Believe something fundamentally bad happened ... Ford which is why she has been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind she had recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist who rented a room in her house\nThat caused sort of put the second front door in her house so patients could come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to write me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then sell 'em out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen cent of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime dying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward\nAnd when the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or so perfect\nFor um her response is drew out I'm feeling some sympathy say we're absolutely perfect I'm can make you on her side and afraid to challenge her\nSure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given a witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys\n... and that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and the doctor it didn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years at Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals\nWhat was she would have done Seventy one books in periodicals there's no evidence that affected her life at all in every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other they've all been proven not to occur\nAnd Jeanie you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party do you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nBelieve it you know you can't say that you you can't say that you can't say if I can I just\nDon't know that that's terrible I'm a Democrat to please Jeannie ... don't do that because men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife my sister my mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women when I think about women I think about my wife for forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister\nWho's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities every citizen\nBut I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault\nAnd due process ferrets out\nGood from the bad the right from the wrong and then I wasn't Mendez due process rights because that guarantees down the road\nThat wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with the me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charge why there's a title nine violation or rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister growth that's disgusting and if somebody groups a woman\nI Want them to be held to account but every now and then a woman like Christina forward either doesn't know the truth or tell us ally and when that happens I went the presumption of innocence to make sure it's available for innocent victims who've been charged such as bread cabinet Brett Kavanaugh as one of the biggest victims in this whole thing would you agree\nOh absolutely I I mean I agree with you I don't think women should not be protected they are they needed up on a pedestal\nAbsolutely ... more respect for women than men\nBecause I Know too many men in my life and I respect women a lot more than I that that then I Love and ... men because I Know women are the best people on God's green earth we got to run Jeannie thanks for calling from
