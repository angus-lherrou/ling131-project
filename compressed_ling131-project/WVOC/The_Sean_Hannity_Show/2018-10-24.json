V. O. C. N. I. orange radio station\nAnywhere you go on the heart radio at\n\nFox News alerts president it will appeal for unity how many ... after a string\nOf suspicious packages mainly targeting high profile Democrats including former president bronco bomber\nNow the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and\nI listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday why haven't on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see that\nThis building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces bidding it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then start screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist it you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city\nWhere people are dying now you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt it\nOught not be crisis precipitate it at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\nAnd ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office you know\nWith all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nYou know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly ... a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports of suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nWere actually sent to President Trump\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that still leaves the shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't\nOn the air and say see I blame burning I just I did the opposite I don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that but the media today and their their reaction to this is so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan it just they're so quick to blame\nWe

Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nStop confronting people like Pam Bondi stopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office\nOf Kevin McCarthy and watching this on a regular basis you know it's a very scary thing\nFor anybody to have to live through um what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD their their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they're alive we'll get updates from shore throughout the day\nOut of the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act so strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first ladies that as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation\nAnd bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we will spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously almost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins\nSoros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the\nRoot of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nWhen he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this what I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative\nOr Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf in silent to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nIn particular person at another network I won't say who\nWas going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to get my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately\nPart of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants\nAnd attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spent on you or threatened you or follow you I have had all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our for our politicians have whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with Arnie conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we do know one thing yet who's responsible I immediately that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat they will say well the president says fake news\nAre they are fake news no truth is ... words are very different than actions\nLike Bernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was incendiary to me I just\nBut you know he's not responsible because uh not that supports him\nIt's unbelievable they apocryphal see how many of you know how many of reported that three weeks ago rice and letters were sent to the president\nAnd secretary of defense Mattis ... director right and to our CIA director Gina Haspel anybody even hear about that\nI didn't hear a lot of concern from people on the left when Don junior when he had gone through that and by the way that's nothing compared to the threats people getting these\nThis is happening every day this is a very very dangerous political environment\nEverybody needs to take a deep breath you don't like you you you want Nancy Pelosi speaker go vote for\nYou want Chuck Schumer to be set of majority you have the ability to go vote on so and so's governor go vote keep your hands to yourself and uh you know and keep it and leave people if they're in public alone\nOr at least leave the women a lot of ... percent Pam Bondi alone and secretary Nielsen and Sarah Sanders and our kids alone if Ted Cruz's out with his wife can you leave them alone leave his

next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you get an aide to stuff or you know you blow to pieces it's harder to collect the evidence that you could send to a ... a machine right so\nNow you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps though writing the device slim side they're going to break this stuff down\nWhere and how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different chairs and there are so many packages loose who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the ... gene okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head they're per suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is set devices a note on one with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period hole stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber\nHe was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me the police Sean that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out that John Brennan and you know and it'd be the comet he's not a CNN country of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of the Savage at an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience in this this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks\nHe got injured which just in New York city there were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms over the next two weeks\nSo we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think we can a couple of days or they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nA commission and

we have this\nMorning [noise] and they didn't want to be like you know the amazing\nThis is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your bar poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing and each of these red states they have to mislead they've toward a moderate voters and play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity\nThis is about just doing what you said I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and that and they could only make one choice one\nBut he did not take a choice\nIt's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there was an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNo I Know and it it it's her to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm\nIn the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else on if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks than how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that are happening North Dakota this week\nYou know I think well that should've happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically means that you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota\nDollar mega millions drawing South Carolina lottery officials say one
