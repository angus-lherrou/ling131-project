V. O. C. I. orange radio station will be\nAnywhere you go on the eye hearts radiolab\nNot ruling anything out from the ... vaccine is as the FBI investigates claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh I'm\nDemocratic senators FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this is by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former yelled classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one oh exposed himself now that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them\nLast week 'cause they they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford but while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is the lawyer that represents professor Ford but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right a professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nSeeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent a late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school\nOf the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by break cabin on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit\nPleased contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people\nShe mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was add\nOnto the you know that one of your perjury I mean ... ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened\nWhat professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed\nPerjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week now is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes\nThen the only thing they've got is well didn't commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to have blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the number two and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night\nI mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or\nAnybody else for that matter um anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time many of which I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he's a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim\nMajority of those surveyed sided with her but they found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea as to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned\nDuring Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate\nBecause that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this was not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have but getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want to Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching the news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds\nAnd you're sick of their agenda there's blood thinning of Kavanaugh this the agenda that just destroy Trump the agenda of higher taxes they want their crumbs

the FBI had to do their jobs and James Comey is suggests\nThey well if you don't talk to the FBI is pretty amazing to me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement of the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly\nWith the FBI and you're talking to them it's a crime name it's a felony

don't mind answering the question but you know I I'd like to do the ... the other headline in the cabinet and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later they haven't had a great deal of hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it\nOr if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C\nA lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing has a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge\nBrett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week\nIf they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professional forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we've got to delay like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now sir how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider and frankly in an age when\nJustice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trying out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is\nIt tells us who they are I mean I think the key to the election this fall is which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending lady was totally uncorroborated sauces that seemed really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as can be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe something well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that but what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis is nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge cow\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin age meaner cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want\nAnd I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years\nYou know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech and I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused\nOf literally drugging women and boys lined up or halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me in a plane historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when\nYou know Cory Booker says the euro complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example you're getting one Blumenthal who as a person was pointing out is terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln would she have at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty speaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your per person than\nPlainly state it is the you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points and dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nShe's not some random back bench not cake she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of the Trump Administration you harass them in the stores you harassed them at the gas station you harass them at ... at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know at an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we both suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they ...\nUs the quarterback Jake Bentley left Saturday's game with a knee injury but head coach will must

you'd be happy recalling him getting out to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there there was an amazing show at its time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them are doing the things that people want a mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one for silver conservatives we have a moral up as if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one okay that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrat they're dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witness was being coaxed ally\nPeople being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that a public ends we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think you look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita broader it's FBI investigation they don't want\nAny of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that his politics anyway appreciate the call of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh Carrie Severino is going to join

as the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take al Franken's side\nAnd you know it as you you just got to watch this it there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they\nGet a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him in thirty six days\nIt's Democrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy

get the government you deserve we always do you want all progress that we have now\nAchieved and two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well\nNo no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious in and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is cream court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably we're\n... I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she worked at every Democrat that that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization you know it it it\nIt is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\nTo hear your kind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but anyway this couch them because they disagree with in any way\nOn a he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit and the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I but it\nUp you know the parents to do auto reputation now if you read James\n... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because you know all the guys back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents\nAnd answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am\nSomebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and McKay been struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the whole to the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look in his company's coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to live the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAs their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI does to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the St Louis to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't ...\nCan't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's my prediction\nUndemocratic IRA and that they don't have any other thing they've already moved\nOn I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even still share it with him she said what positive he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but if that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... even counting the credibility\nFor the FBI can talk to her and they'll they'll get their faith in it and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to take a whole New Orleans and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and maybe

become the president then you can pick your own person and you can do what you think is best then you can be\nAs boring as you want to be as president every single day and maybe yeah maybe President Trump has more personality but you notice that style it's always comes down to style\nYou cannot argue with the results is what the media is fixated on this is what never Trump is fixated on there is
