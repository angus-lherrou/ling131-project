what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you because ah you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it\nOne of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported and\nUh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy\nBroke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd this came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said\nMr speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo\nI said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN\nIs named my ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years and I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Sean Hannity says had a direct language ... man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative just you know it's not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes Trump Robert De Niro is calling the president devil and us devil worshippers effect you know\nA decent playing the victim card but it was top of mind ten days ago and it says she's going to be said what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly [noise] stupid he's a punk his dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist mutt who doesn't know what he's

hunting kill jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach the president so\nYou've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop policy and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a tick rational race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia\nTen were barber concerts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had all the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on concept so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLittle things that Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats ... become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nA split decision except that the Democrats will have a focus they will control the house committees that are going to change to think of think of the intelligence committee incentive Devin Nunes running it\nYou'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the ah with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes the leak all this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing\nThey are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that the\nDemocrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house the losing of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump that is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it\nRelates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build the name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that ... top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands it they they they're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power\nAnd the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michel\nWas presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour barred ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh Democrats their National Committee to the one\nThe ... that money needs to find his way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are an spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans won the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right in the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if as John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... good luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the way to work before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing doing what Maxine Waters and say\nPrompts responsible for you know ... a set of uh uh sending but the ten or twelve arms around\nOr vice versa blame the Democrats\nCan we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the ... ...\n... building the wall and having a pathway to the ...\nOkay so that I Am sort of old trucker offered that deal to the Democrats they do have a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because he was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats that yes but goodness gracious I Would do that in our our feet I think it makes sense ah ... in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nDonnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian\nPresidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big deal to people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all of them beating Donald Trump's so this race November six is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November six in fact\nThey should go to your website for Hannity dot com and see the top thirty most important races in the house and go and click through in click through and donate to the Republicans to match whatever the Democrats are doing to try to take control because yes race November ... is really about the next presidential race\nAll right thank you Doug Jones thank you John McLaughlin eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number

Hillsdale dot com L. E. V. I. and free Hillsdale dot com\nNot ladies and gentlemen I I have a solution for this a play called a caravan this invasion that's taking place I have a solution I posted up on Facebook and is this\nThe a prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau trip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally have solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do president United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got seven to fourteen\nThousand people coming here illegally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's where we are going to do\nWhen I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them tour northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants them\nThese people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume there are ...\nEven though they're carrying their flags\nAnd in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving there how halls Canada receives them because our arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea Mr bridges\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could\nProbably use so that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan\nHa a parade of illegal immigrants who were coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use uber to I don't care if we can use uber can use taxis greyhound whatever\nI'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhile Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we have a lip and number two if not if we have a regular American\n\nMike in Maryland the great WMA or go\nHey mark great talking to you a dime color or anything else on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push this guy but with that\nUm you know the first time where supporters of the other candidates have been directly account of attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and I thought things that people when they when they pick the five and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that it's a it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that is the borders of the Democrats the way that the Democrat I think I think\nArmed burglaries and so forth and we actually to believe\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentlemen this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb in two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally play it all the time well if the president we keep down his rent has nothing to do with the president then as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's his supporters us who are called\nNeo Nazis and racist it's the president who's called a racist and he's called a racist and Nazi on MSNBC\nAnd CNN by the late night host\nWhich is really truly appalling absolutely appalling\n\nAnd then they tell you know we got to tone down here toned down immediately out of the box sucker who's responsible for CNN\nPuts out a statement without knowing anything blaming Trump\nJake Tapper such a fool he goes on the air like John Harris I think that they go in there and say what Trump said stop blaming him he was blaming him what do you know is blaming ham all of you idiots are blaming him your network MSL Estee some idiot writing a column in I'm\nIn the Washington Post Dana Milbank\nTalk about a low life\nLook at this Joe Scarborough Mika Brzezinski this is a

Margaret Mr producer who do you recommend that I should speak\nTo\nEight Seventy am Ken in California go\nYes mark ... or some employers and it scares me but I think I have a lotion\nI Need you to clarify the numbers for me well out here to help sir I heard that there are are either fifty thousand or five hundred thousand cases\nTo be adjudicated as to whether they can stay in the country\nNo that's wrong there's one million\nIt's one million okay that's where I'm\nPutting a heritage a backlog of one million so that people understand how this works when somebody's stepped foot in the country and uses magic words that the lawyers tell them they use lawyers south of the border lore is north of the border they have the system they know what the law as\nIt triggers a mechanism a jerk radical legal mechanism where they have a right to be a period before administrative law judges and because there's so many of them\nThey're given a date to return and often that they could be two or three years away and guess what the vast majority of them never show up\nRight now I realize that so I my solution partial solution would be to try to in in California for example if there are shortages of attorneys you can appointed commissioner is that possible to point oh hey\nThey are they disappear in the shadows you can appoint a commissioner you're going to punish caring for the day you know they're not listen to me I Know you're you're you're in trouble with your idea they're not coming to court they're not coming back\nBut at least we will be able to like it more as they come you\nKnow you don't understand they have a right to come back they don't have to be a ... in other words nobody adjudicate something right there you get through to assemble your evidence to make your arguments and so forth and so on so they're not going to adjudicate them right there\nI mean we look at the process\nAnd the president has been begging Congress trying to change the system to prevent this and of course the Democrats refused\nSo we got to be able to to eliminate that you know in backlog you're talking about\nYou know the million backlog is one day going to become a two million back up and this backlog that I talk about again these people are gone there somewhere in our country we don't know where they live\nSome cases they gave false names have false IDs it becomes impossible it becomes about women or the right now absolute anarchy in the immigration world and you can find the Democrats and the federal judge absolute honesty thank you for your call my friend I shall return

choose me he\nSaid that but what you didn't like is he also told you to lower it bumps nurses just go ahead\nBecause I asked president have a big impact on people and what I say just as the media have an impact just as everybody else had\nBernie Sanders has an impact just as the uh the nut job in Utah who sent the rice and packages and others when Democrats speak they have an impact when the media speak they have an impact\n\nNothing that Donald Trump said resulted in a rice and being sent to a Susan Collins\nOr General Mattis or the head of our navy or to his kids are the Trump himself\nRight who's responsible for that Maxine Waters who seriously Chuck Schumer Adam Schiff who's responsible for that Dana Bash go ahead\nReally the man with the loudest megaphones and the most Twitter followers in politics and so that was a big omission\nNow this was a reporter ladies and gentleman who is giving her opinion endlessly and that's part of the problem in this country\nThere are people who give opinions people like me like Sean like rush like Carlson like getting ready to go down the list and there are people who are supposed to be straight news people not interpreting the news not giving their opinion on the news not question just give the news\nDoes that sound like Dana Bash she sounds like Jen pulmonary\nA mouthpiece for Iraq no house Benita Obama\nDiet\nHave not seen him

know the\nMillion people here are you on my I guess we hear you we know what you're saying we're thinking smart American people not what you think we are\nI'll give you another example\nOn this kind of an issue that is the invasion listen that Joe Scarborough today on MSNBC cut fourteen go\nWe will not be distracted from been proved out there\nThat brown people are coming\nTo invade America [noise]\nUh this is all about\nRepublicans don't want to talk about the fact\nThat they got in people's health care\nAnd they they don't want to have to face that through the book so it's all about this or you know that that was said James ... is the word I'm looking at work yeah\nThat's exactly what's happening except now it's Republicans doing it this guy this guy really is\nA mental image you look at the brown people the brown people\n\nWe want to enforce our laws and you see it's about the brown people\n\nScarborough the White House man on TV next to Chris Matthews it's about the brown people really went Shelby Steele was one of my uh Fox show several months ago on life liberty and love\nHe pointed out the guys at talk this way they feel like they immunize themselves from criticism that they're better than all of you and so they can position themselves you see is\nSupporting brown people but you folks out there who aren't brown you obviously have brown people because you don't agree with Joe\nThis is a sick mindset and they want to talk about\n... fuel on the fire when they constantly push this racist narrative\nConstantly\nAnd then secondarily Republicans have gutted people's health care Obamacare is in place other than the individual mandate nobody's got it anything\nMedicare's in place Medicaid's been expanded Obamacare's in place\nAll kinds of welfare programs out there what exactly has been got it what's gutted quality affordable health care is government is Obamacare and the law so now all of a sudden this full\nWho claims to be a conservative nobody else
