between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann in Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a liquor Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents\nFor the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called ... cave memos which could very directly bear upon this question of what was Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting a immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that of is when you die if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week uh we are going to issue a subpoena\nTo the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page tax ah\nThe ah the the roof or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's been the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow do getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened there there there we have\nPeople that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy or to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until\nThe real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain those ... obtain these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work\nBrought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into community people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love\nNo but I again I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food and does have a network of of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within a ... just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't ... I think\nMy first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the\nTime ... it's funny Sean right a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview it in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've\nNever been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged ...\n... ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about\nThat that they ask you specifics about that does say\nAbsolutely yeah and to basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lives about you\nI Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you gonna do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties have got to be some recourse for you well\nI'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nYou know for you and and I think this is all going to end soon is my guest and I don't think so I don't think the president was involved in any collusion he never was I think the big story here is the abuse of power I'm putting the fix for Hillary what happened to you with the ... application warrants\nA I think the abuse of intelligence to weaponize thing of our intelligence is another big issue\nAnd I think there's a lot more to come I think when you hear the News Tomorrow I think you're going to be pretty shocked again that these things really did happen and I don't I in the end I don't want this to hurt law enforcement I Love law enforcement\nI Love oriental community but you can't turn the tools of intelligence as powerful as they are on the American people\nI fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy no right so much as just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents you know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations\nThey started saying well our bosses and want to [laughter] you know and they I think they saw through it but they knew you know and that was back during the\n... Mehra as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to Vladimir ... Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot\nTo fix that situation I think you know those are his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that is going to be fixed overtime I'm confident\nCarter Page thanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred nine ... is our number thank you sir\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIn the ... the new center finally Suzie Michael is now a category one hurricane hurricane headed toward the Florida Panhandle right now and is expected to make\nLandfall late Wednesday morning here in the Columbia area we should start to feel the effects of Michael Wednesday evening and throughout the day on Thursday possibly through the day friday as well\nSenator Lindsey Graham is happy that efforts to stop Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh failed on Fox News Sunday Graham says there's only one way Democrats can get justice is on the Supreme\nCourt we're not going to let you pick the judges if you want to paint judges they need to win the White House\nGraham also says he's happy that the mob rule lost voters in the state can start casting their absentee ballots today for next month general election voter registration has been extended until October seventeenth that extension went into effect\nTo give those who were affected by Hurricane Florence enough time to register and ... says the news radio five sixty W.

you have this tendency to kind of you know want to understand how liberal see the world again I was never a liberal I'm a I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was that they're saying a moment\n\nAnd then they said I was a moment for me was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a cop access to you know there are a listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just gave a damn they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and he is a word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know again sometimes sometimes that even kind of see it the liberal away from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who I Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously and immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving him a fair shake I'm telling you that was my that in a moment\n... said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing his story in an unquestionably tragic incident that will use of force\nIncidents are no one goes out in the street with the desire to get use of force incidents sorry do you think that's what cops do your seriously seek professional help\n\nBut to see the way they were treated that was my they're saying a moment I'm telling you Democrats I'm telling you that they're saying a moment is happening almost daily now with you guys and ladies\nScreaming and raving like lunatics attacking\nPeople I have

talking about the lessons learned from the cabinet when dropping the big at all on the left or you just had as a formal swearing in ceremony although he's already been sworn in at the White House came into\nOn the wrist applause gosh winning feels good and I've been given you the lessons\nLearned from this we're up to rule number are are lesson learned I should say keep saying rural less 'cause I'm so used to say an old rules new rules that's kinda my thing for those you know me from\nMy show [laughter] but this is lesson learned lesson learned number six Democrats are now trashing\nDo a judicial supremacy again had to Dan Horowitz has a great piece on this a conservative review today\n\nFolks this is not a bad thing now all of a sudden the Democrats\nThat they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought they'd have a six three majority with the president Hillary Clinton right now as salary and in quite work out that way\nNow that it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than Anthony\nKennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\nThe liberals are now attacking the course now listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but Horowitz makes a really good point here folks liberals for years have had a really\nHard time doing one thing\nThey can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it now I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items that liberals\nOn abortion on demand a yeah a basic income\nMedicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for they wanted a national mandate for gay\nMarriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\n\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it\nIt is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the the thing you're just get a bunch\nOf liberals pretending to be judges on the courts you choose to legislate from the bench\nAnd you don't have to do the hard work of knocking on doors getting elected and telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie at a DMV excuse me ... or whatever the deal is they can't run that either they convincing them that that's good\nFor them you can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them\nThey're starting to now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen shot all of this\nBecause there may unfortunately become a time\nWhen they take back a majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back at them on Twitter\nHey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy and the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything until there's actual principles their principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is Jenny afflicting before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use to get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is if the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is don't need to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the court should be deciding things [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYes welcome to the party piles Bruce Willis ed and die hard\nCubs fan PY obey\nBring it\nYou're welcome we don't believe that either we believe\nIn a constitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to elect representatives and a representative democracy that are going to go vote for our values the fact that you can't do that ... sounds a whole lot like your problem not ours\nWe haven't had any problem getting tax cuts passed through because we believe in economic liberty fat a lot of problems slowing down the growth of government but we've had some victories not a lot but some and it's been hard work and people have to take votes\nBut they don't want to take votes liberals they want to pass it all off on the court why do they don't want to take votes because ladies and gentlemen think about
