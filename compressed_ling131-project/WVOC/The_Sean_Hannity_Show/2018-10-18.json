I've been listening to you for twenty five plus years\nI just wanted to make a quick point about that whole caravan um I think it's a godsend for Trump because I Believe that Americans like me was that elected him you know we respect to sing about this country fairness\nAnd strength and um\nYou know the Kavanaugh hearing was going down before Kavanaugh's show strength\nAnd every time Trump shows during the games you gains momentum and we found the military down there as a message and if the military treats everyone would respect a sort of almost like a enhanced FEMA\nThen I think this

digging their heels even even further down and it makes president more comfortable and confident because he's\nUsed to being attacked and it doesn't faze him you know and um I just think that the

this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well the only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs keep Obamacare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're

know house barbershops their Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate house system just for them very different\nSo that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this borders I watch this care of it\nYou got to understand this is a about national security this his personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times side Hannity you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego and many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated guess where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a Percocet and knocks econ and then they go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip that these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or deal or friend quote of there's\nThis is why you try heroin does much better high on the lowly ten dollars a bag and they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon is they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually they're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell and that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son bought on than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know they know corroborating evidence I still believe her\nYeah but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nIt's up to the United states of America and thankfully we have a president that saying you know this is not going to fly with me or the American people and the president is now saying we're going to stop you in your tracks and the president has now poll Mexico and Honduras\nUm excuse me uh in the strongest terms I'm asking Mexico doesn't sound like an ask\nAt is stop the onslaught\nIf you're unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nThen he posted in another one continuing to blast Democrats 'cause they're the ones that won't open borders eliminate Eisen sanctuary cities and free healthcare for illegal immigrants course free means you pay for it\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they want open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd whose leaders are doing little to stop a large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico or to the U.S and he said that he will pull aid for these countries\nAnd then he said the assault on our country at the southern border including the criminal elements\nAnd drugs pouring in is far more important to me as president and train and the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border this is all the Democrats fall weak laws then of course they don't want to build the border well guess what it also means\nThat means more drugs coming into every small town and big city in this country this should be on your mind to Nineteen days

keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new electric violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because as Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I ... everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth oh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think that just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the

the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura

Munoz is going to return after this election his work I was going good last worked as a vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements that these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we talk about this Ninety nine page report\nOn fire the court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um

just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival salt would do to get your reaction considering you were\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ...

into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation says\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words member don't trust somebody of actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with his caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should come down and should be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of anything to the United states and then when he does that you criticize them for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it\nThe media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freak out and they all go into overdrive over\nIt and and the fake outrageous have you know I've been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they allowed women to drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give them a license that'll shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they will they will literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will\nAbout ... feet as part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having\nRelations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations\nWith Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken on his own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know\nWhy we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can lay and we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other ... Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is you know we've been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong this there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective of I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better than their life is more important than your life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use\nA I Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated that has happened I hate this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire\nLife so spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant caravan are legal immigrants heading towards America is what a president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome operate because you don't you know I mean what what what is the media want Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left wants to do but I'm saying this directly the media do they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a a a great fence\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America\nAnd break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump pug\nOne eight seven seven three one\nAnd I'm Glad you grab that\nMuch of America if this kind of thing has to go on but uh I was going to make up about about a year [noise] what you're talking about earlier about the\nA hard time hearing you hearing you with the dog so let's see if we can get a better connection in the meantime I Will try to try that again in a moment one eighty seven seven three one thirty eight eleven is Donald Trump during the right thing as president to defend the border and say I will say in\n\nMilitary down there to stop this caravan this is what leadership strong leadership looks like Ben Ferguson filling in for the great one we'll be right back\n\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that feels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide\nSuper beach by human as harness the power of nutrient rich beach\nAnd created a super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own one teaspoon of super beats daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving your natural energy without\nThe need of a quick caffeine cat or a sugar high we're talking real healthy natural energy caught eight six six to zero five for nine zero seven\nOr go to super beats dot com backslash Levin L.

aggressively growing\n\nThen it's better for everybody where where the water rises insert all ships\nInsert\nHardcore leftist Democrat who has I Would argue virtually no soul and the reason why I say that is\nBased on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts where she did everything in her power to destroy a a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out with an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars a six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is a lie\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just sit in that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie\nAnd for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is ally I'm not going to focus on that for ... that's that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nHarris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey from the website bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rates survey came out and it said their headline of his own survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\nSo what you have is you have\nCome out of hairs are saying okay Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me\nBecause people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps or we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I gotta do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected\nExpense let me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nGo back to her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year and the reason why she wants to give you that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars\nFor an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase a medical bill or childcare so she wants to give you a government subsidized money so that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expects\nNow my my quick question for you is
