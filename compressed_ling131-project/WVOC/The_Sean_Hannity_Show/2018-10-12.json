Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handles Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it or don't told Trump to bring these guys in the eyes shut and all and\nI should have known Geraldo told Trump to get Kanye West in there and Joe Brown\nAnd tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know the Geraldo did bring up a uh something I forgot it was\nKanye West who told George W. Bush\nThat\nHe didn't think he cared about black people because Hurricane Katrina boy that remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans the left was out there saying that Bush wanted\nBlacks in Louisiana New Orleans to be hurt so that they would leave and go to Texas or someplace to lessen the strength of the Democratic party in Louisiana they were out there saying that the Bush also I was able to steer the hurricane and that Bush was\nResponsible for the Lebanese being weak because he didn't hold people accountable when they didn't spend the money to shore them up but it was Kanye West so can you hear all kinds of crab\nBack then in two thousand five rip it ended up ... they loved him but the love was sleeping obviously be right back\nTo Russia Mickey I miss work\nUse radio five sixty W ...

James O'Keefe is going to join us\nAnd a Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there him and his campaign of his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at Tennessee\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it's not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh wait do we get to the tape on sentiment today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're gonna do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but then when they get their here's what they're going to do\nEven though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer of that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering solutions and the answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up\nAll of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in\nGrading factories manufacturing centers here and well they tell him well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation well the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform or give me an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of ballast marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently she'd run in a horrible economic difficulties like there's no one knew on some times in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen and then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude\nThat deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe but given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about saving neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred burning Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed where the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human our human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that it's downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vial thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow they'll read flat folks\nAren't that since praying pining away from the race on draft now the sudden ... hats and he's on the more like the printed out and have all of a sudden now that the the modeled spokes person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump administration's this wasn't in bed\nSmith Conyers mother is rolling over and her great\nI think you had there a man who is clearly not OK and a president who's willing to accept boy that was a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of a mental health and the question of other quoting him I felt very point and to me that was something very fragile about ... and sad about kind of pulling out of the phone and France played type can't as colorfully outside I think it was for their own piling up somewhere picture of a car I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television at that but I think\nWe had a thoughtful play by play and political and now as you're not thinking is that with her fault on our White House\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually feel bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\nThis was white supremacy by ring true of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices yet of black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been shown check by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Conyers except I talked to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is a packed on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say\nMy friend Heisman Trophy\nWinning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and the questions is on their behavior and as a guest or

end of the world of the Democrats where it's just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress I ... that's really the

thank you I don't think there's any doubt the Kavanaugh overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and send them a in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies and when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stopped but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations and\nWhat they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash of about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your paltry to raise taxes take what you got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things were before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country\nSo these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance\nOne way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and and you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but\nNot quite as far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do\nI think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of their country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of the New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it so he actually said those conservative\nOr their problems not me stem cells are streaming or write to\nMe was that there are closer to the extreme conservative so he knows that it's not because it's\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle me\nUh I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything and you love and vote for once me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to\nPromote Hannity whenever office would like to run for it I think my friend John and I can ...\nThe ... well you disabuse our friend\nDoug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a this former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid or because you\nBullets so far left chat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but\nBut I don't even think I don't think they'll make should get through Mayor Bloomberg or get or a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing and the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in terms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their wives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just fighting is a frightening Republicans\nDoug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely thought she should go period and start\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times or have been on the radio is you know you knew what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should it be it should be better stop Nancy Pelosi's from getting\nOh I think it's got to do that or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market health care plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh over all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nMake sure that health care is covered for those with\nPreexisting by the way Donald Trump is saying the same thing\nGood it's just the Republican Party has not been a sensitive to the issue as the Democrats but I I got another issue sharp\nThey're all saying hold onto a Obamacare So\nWell come my way of thinking what they should say is no ... no impeachment of cabin on no impeachment of Trump just to work on issues like a compromise on immigration compromise on healthcare and continue choice in education\nNow let me tell you if they if they would listen to that which they never will because they're not a moderate party that would absolutely pretty much wrap it up for the house in my opinion\nI agree Sean where I'm the same page John Dwight happier support to work with Sean when we find a state or a nation for him to run in for the highest could operate\nWe can do that a yes or no he could run out I got a winning\nOr do you like

Fox News Andrew Brunson the American pastor held in Turkey on terrorism charges fried earlier today heading back to the u._s. then a meeting with President Trump boxes Jessica Rosenthal has more lives\nBut times people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over here turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics with or you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage moral outrage by the media on back of ... a visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially this bond is Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility on oh Chuck Schumer I've you'd be so maybe you know as long as you're not the the spawn are saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to ten say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights\nAnd therefore at our bass were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and unless sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when adversity strikes\nWhen something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting you arrange for his first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here\nSo let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit so many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still that\nYou have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way well I mean by anybody other than I have an Audi I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create a little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science\nWhat fraud they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation the reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd see I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this list there said\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which ... who could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families\nOh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies whenever you feel like as long as your reasons are good enough if a sliding scale of morality and we don't want to\nWhat about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton\nTo have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office that is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nAre you five or six or seven and eight where are you where\nWhen you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your alive who are they do or they are they fix is on a good day and three is not a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to information the first place and the problem is that a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there were only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent throw everything that's it\nSo you've got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because anymore\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world and we now live in\nSo ... for ...\nAnd well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years\nRemember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president well that was a little bit of a different story\nAnd over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about this the kind of me and that's where we're

Bush was a racist no goal\nDuring the country in the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was either mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there are earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nIt maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination\nOf everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time he's looking he'll look it gone you know look at the teleprompter ill or get gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran he said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah no\nIt isn't as\nBad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up it starts reading the teleprompter\nAnd all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThat you can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nThat has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing a path and an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you had to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\n[laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going be [noise] I um I had to smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office doing a an employment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place and I can\nTell after a couple of minutes that it was good she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nI was like OK gets off the phone and she tells me you know what to do just happen Senate making too much money\nSingle mother she's a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took a catalyst it at a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had\nWe had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties why didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change we know it was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep them on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping economy that will not allow people tablet poured mobility boom you're gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nBut what do you say\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue was not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nKnow I went through a full body X ray CAT scan the Cleveland Clinic to find out I have coronary artery disease

say oh well he's right using races okay oh\n[laughter]\nBuddy ... already so\nIt's been an interesting couple of days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility\nAnd the most pervasive form a bias in the media which happens to be old mission now they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of this first that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center\nFolks revert news busters now Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media the negative Ninety two percent and you you compare it to Iraq Obama the same point about forty six percent negative\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple years into the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou don't have the media media\nIs always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval rating\nBut there's been a pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of berries different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we've continued to see it rise\nYou'll see some pulling rats was at one point as we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to Brock Obama's among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher now imagine this for about\nA president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet the one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\n... it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll the lives that were thrown out there and we're perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that well you know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nAnd that and many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know mental they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better bees are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIs why we might actually be one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans that not losing\nAnd this presidential election cycle\nFees are all the things that are on the table something else [noise] but you can't lie to people about [noise] you can't lie to

Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits the ...\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nI mean it is financial fraud that's bigger than Bernie Madoff you as a political party\nPerpetuating it in Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it financial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to borders gubernatorial race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins\nWell we've got much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you\nOne of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this thing I just it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited and running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of the five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode that wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out just South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to a ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he used the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic what you're talking about the governor's race because Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here now this is why it's important to educate\nIs why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal see fit or a has a basic financial literacy test and right now more than sixty percent of adults fail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have\nConversations and concepts like this doesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they are financially illiterate then these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nBut it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about another\nBig time fraud perpetuated on us the minimum wage who earns it pretty much nobody and that's the dirty little secret\nAbout that next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim America now with me ... tonight at nine or news radio five sixty W\nDoes not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart zip recruiter

Can't remember the things that was one of those ah [noise] [laughter]\nWhat just happened moments Gore's the in the grand scheme of the media kind of losing his mind everybody had to point out what to cut and have iPhone password to use words job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragon energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to kind of channel all of that and and you gotta you know so every now and then you're going to have a a hydrogen I I play and the president or the president [laughter]\n[laughter] I was talking earlier you one of my one of my all time favorite reactions Michael Meyers\nWatching ... da du the a Katrina relief like\nWhere is the exit button on this stage right now how can I get off of here now please\nAnd ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is like okay [laughter] what do I do here and you talk about role reversal because he's usually that people may person making people gum trouble but uh you gotta gotta feeling that for once he got a dose of his own are kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you missed what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nFifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pasted insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent a hundred percent of folks a worker on are contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country\nAnd it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is perpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult bean financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate\nIt's all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else that is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person net take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody why haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes or they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody's uh I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now\nThe next poured that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well is dishonest to its ally the a C B say you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not the person will the corporate tax cuts\nThe share buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent of all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses an employee racist thirty\nFive percent twenty percent has gone into debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay it off that helps the company become more stable lessons their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean
