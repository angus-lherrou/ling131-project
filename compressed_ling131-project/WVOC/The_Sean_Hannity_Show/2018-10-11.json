dropping nearly seven hundred points until now a volatile day but not quite this bad\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think it's done a phenomenal job or as it relates to you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close\nA we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican Kemp up by two\nAnd so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and rats musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should've been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats I end up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now um\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning\nAnd when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made it was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the life blood of western Europe's economy\nIt's just simple basic things\nNobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury\nApparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal

Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea\nYou know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering\nMight even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world and I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us in chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening

Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the\n... he can start again\nBut until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and for that is strange [noise]\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be simple of we disagree with them now give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid to their neighbors and you want them angry the one dimensional\nWondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist mobs and they are moms\nAnd this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the quote so called leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nTo go on to your friends your neighbors don't whether they're independent or whether they're Republican

values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nDemocrats said get up in their face they need to realize there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you don't know where these people are\nWhen we shouldn't do is incite people to violate the problem is is rational

testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is and it can from when he goes through his confirmation process he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has question Wayne called is this or that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... a account\nOf someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it's her you're supposed to come in at birth order your\nMaybe he's the guy who runs the Justice Department and understand the timeline\nMay ninth Kobe is fire based on the Rosenstein them all on basic faith is when he has this conversation with police the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... feet and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller his name's Becca council also on ... what else happened on ... ... more than ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third pies ever know we'll get signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we what it's all you want to bring in and ask you questions about all those it then\nThroughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's kind of like going where it went on the pilot the or the health care immigration pact or my opponent is a color your local and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and Barbara Comstock big time and you're right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... a lot in the lab and then she'll every yesterday and all the folks chime in on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there are\nListening to people want the full list the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com at\nAll so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win\nAnd I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I like to say it this way there there's that that left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never decorate material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down yesterday with what Clinton and hold her set about Republican\nWhat are you all the ... they're going after terrorists Sanders I'm Pam Bondi and secretary and the ISIS\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the Web has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nMoved to lift us when we did this the other day but think about taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going we're going to present lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage ... runs Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way ... twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do things to make\nWhy don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences

don't read snow you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIs a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in those schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public edge ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it\nSo impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue the left doesn't mind that young

Sharpton you look at several others even some of these school teachers that are against Kavanaugh and whatnot and all the tweeting and say look off the president wants off the vice president of us off this person\nHas any one of them thought that maybe they're the ones with the mental handicap\n... just look at the last couple of weeks of the Democratic party\nAnd what they've been saying I mean ... is what happens when negroes don't read Tanya is a token eager the Trump Administration black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the racial draft Conyers attention or why the president\nThen you have ... and it gets better than that Maxine Waters says she threatens Trump supporters all the time\nEric Holder said it's OK to kick Republicans Hillary says not to show civility to Republicans\nI mean ... at what point is is incitement to violence and then they say you can't say that there's mob rule here you because it's unfair to Democrats who say that they're acting like mobs while they're screaming and surrounding people like Ted Cruz at dinner with his wife\nWhen they're banging on the doors the Supreme Court after they don't get their way while they say they want to impeach the president it's America if you vote for them and their right to impeach Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court if you give them ... control of the house or the Senate\nThat's what they're saying and don't forget\nNow Taylor Swift the beautiful white woman is a role model and a brave woman because she came out and supported Democrats the Kanye West comes out for Trump and he's a token negroes mentally ill Uncle Tom\nWho clearly is being used by the president United States of America\nNot only that you look at and cheaper in Oregon and everything they've done to all the ... the peaceful Republican rallies their to\nTheir ... they were directing traffic this last week is screaming at white people they didn't take their owners you saw that on TV\nIt's it's nuts and and my question to the American people is at what point are we going to say enough is enough let's stop this must be done and let's wipe this recon slate clean\nWell I I'm waiting for the the the Democrats to say that socialist Alexander Cortez um\nThat the playbook kids make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh as a rail here's my\nQuestion to you here's my question to use for interrupting what we do conservatives and especially if African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide rock I hate to say\nWell it was Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them over playing their hand with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're furious and they realize it another four years of a Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have well when in point in numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified of but what what I Will say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive and I think the Brett Kavanaugh as what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans who say that character assassination\nThat character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and when there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSay the child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapist\nAnd they went all in\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about it it was about honesty wasn't about fairness it wasn't about a true investigation it wasn't a it was about trying to destroy a man keep them all the Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played it I think will hold the Senate and house I really do if we go out and vote\nAnd I appreciate the phone call thank you sir it's nice to talk to you by the way I just got back from a small little town\nIn

F. word a lot was going to somehow changes tune with the president here's what he had to say today\nThat's not worrying about the future all we really have is today we just have the day over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and dramas on his hero's journey\nRight now and he might not have expected to have a crazy mother Kanye West's run up and are so poor\n\nDon't ... don't forget cutting us also is that an educated white man now because he's supporting Trump\nTell you what is what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mythic pictures [noise]\nThis look at us got let's say and\nBlack folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him and he's an attention for like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the models spokes person he is he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he clearly has issues either already been hospitalized he's already been hospitalized hospitalized\nHe's already been hospitalized so we're going to slander do because he doesn't agree with us want to eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven once you get to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the mark of in Chauvin burgers and filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and I did want an excellent job thrown in for mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or or disturbances\nBut when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody of use it that we're going on\nAnd some you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of a sudden I feel that have led thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression and uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places\nEven up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of a history of anything on a new homeless twice I've lived in my car but\nIt's also suicide prevention month and\nMaking it sound as well ... what kind of mental illness whether he ... is not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say badly about him to be four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't emailed her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just it just so people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I I say this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful when your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college\nUm took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and in all of our close friend group ever since and I have great compassion\nFor those that suffer with\nHealth and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a\nToken a black man uh and and there and he's taken advantage abusing him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the mark of an show Ben Fergus and we did not go ahead\nAnd stole my thunder but there are a President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of it that um they check this out so now Russia walkers it'd be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it's horrible it was left these are doing but as a whole nother thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first he's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue with the Obama's going to really you when you know you really gone too far in the show probably grabbed her by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um but\nHim Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrat power base that's all they do their inciting violence and then they say it in the in the means of\nOh and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator or like Ted Cruz at dinner\nA that's a mob mentality when you go in and you and you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here today to seek out and destroy people when we think about the ... district mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use your the canary\nWe're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we are going to do is we're going to find people to say well you had sex so we had a boat in the eighties well wait we've got to recant the store and there might never happen well he he actually in high school was was every weekend making parties for gang\nRapes and gang banging and and throwing trains on women no one else was ... but we got a porn star lawyer an Avon Audi that will that will act\nLike it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news\nTo try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this as I go back to what I said earlier than\nThere is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's the only way you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on health care because you you are the ones that were created the health care disaster you can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now\nIs to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to race has to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible what they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know what I'm thinking about the mob mentality\nI challenge any of these people to walk down I'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends that are such as you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nI can make them feel good [noise]\nMean John today on all we picked him in and\nAnd we stepped\nOn him yeah there's no mob mentality there is there a ... page forty five that's where she started chanting in a moment and Paige and Paige forward if I stepped on him talking about the president of the America no mob mentality from the\nMom mentality with me too movement Brett
