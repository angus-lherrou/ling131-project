claiming and now she has backtracked I don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave us for names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she ... tracks on a story at what point does the man you know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go office civil discourse in this country\n... ... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and are these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus\nHad the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary and back to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would have to have that kind of\nInstrument guy how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're graciously wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell more than ...\n... and contrast that with his response on the mark from a column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself and it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life\nAs been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key\nPoints and when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else I mean she was saying this\nSo for some reason\nW.

going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute I how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls\nWere being drugged with quote you lose and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high

due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are ... there was nothing to this story [noise] um\nAnd when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go

McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished\nAnd we will have a vote on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware a light Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look at that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the [noise]\nOr your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know that the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so uh my dad owns a bar\nAnd so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess from areas that they're any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nA there your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delay legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha\n... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that that are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation\nI Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well\nI think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system\nGet off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote\nThat way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote with Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut ... of

state you moved to you can't escape and it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare whatever the issue is it's a winner take all\nThat's not at all what the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about it at length\n\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown\nOf the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\n\nIt's not what the constitution created your this progressive movement that became especially strong the earliest period\nThe turn of the last century the early Nineteen\nHundreds of his building in the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course\nBut their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational\nPurpose it's been bastard that\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states\nCollectively in the federal Congress to members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\n\nBut this so called populism movement\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that\n\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism\nWhen it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that you also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional is and conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I had written about this and the Marlboro versus Madison decision the Supreme Court\nSeized power seized power from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a bastard ... not only the constitution but the parties involved\nThere's no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should have been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down the road right now I'm just I'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states these states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not\nRatified in Massachusetts in New York and in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates
