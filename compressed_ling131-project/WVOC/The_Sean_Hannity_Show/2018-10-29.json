race for governor and the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and we have British students team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin all and that is going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers per brightest in calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall hold but people have got to get out to

overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nUh a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to\nWork in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column yet but what if my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the Mark I'm actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelans\nAnd lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks so again no great great mystery this is\nThe work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad in our allies look that well\nI mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall with a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not have anything to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting the status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married almost I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nBut I agree with the sun shine we don't want anybody hurt and also it is undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to the beginning I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the ... in the middle of this I'm simply used\nWe as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people being used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall on and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe holds built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd a comment on that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things look dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but\nWe can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere will without question of what you just described age most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who will control the water\nThat we are supposed to allow me to ... billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot do that\nWe have to maintain control of horrible\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam

Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words it we

of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went through the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate

sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever

with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here in secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's a\nWhile it to you know a horrific act or worse anti Semitic attacking and us history that claimed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nI got to meet with a members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nA bit really brought out the entire community faith leaders that Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and\nUh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and and uh everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here and I think they were just shocked and stuff on a and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with that that they're not alone\nAnd they in Israel yesterday morning our government and they taught Sunday because some days like Monday in Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government\nOf Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why we support for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach which was about that yeah we are the ones with the speech that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were in Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grooming anti Semitism throughout your\nUh the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as they call it in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we can ... it is it's going to say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began to two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand four ten and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is it is once again become fashionable or to attack us and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out to choose for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you see in attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks it gets used in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six energy federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen Jewish community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you can have a a one one artist of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream is saying I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before\nSo I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your\nUnfortunately the thirties can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see what sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nHe's laid it out any objective news organization should be laying this house but they're not going to cause they're not objective when they're really not news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live after a long summer of running your air conditioning the time is quickly approaching the start running your heater as temperatures drop and most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S looks parents say colder October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ... filters\nWe have the perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filter by dot com America's leading provider of eight fact filters for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America said five percent when you subscribe for auto replacement so you'll never forget to change your filters ever again filtered by\nWill save you time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filter by dot com and tell them mark sent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's coming up too and we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week\nI Will also be doing an appearance on Hannity uh at some point this week and we're going to uh commit my Sunday show to a ... or the pre election as well it's just way too important\nHe's got some very very close races\nAnd what's at stake here is enormous\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism there really is for those of us really know what's Americanism versus progressive as to talk to you to know the media in this country they don't like to be called the enemy of the people there are certainly not the front of the people who've gone long ago\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House you glean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] much\nRush Limbaugh weekdays knew the three news radio five sixty Wu ... history we\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry aren't president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both though that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll still students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at living for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her of of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she is accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures\nAre from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up but Senator McCaskill end up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill\nEver introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against the middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and that people want somebody is going to be a fighter for the middle class workers and not just another big government liberal but\nYou know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state was McCaskill saying you will oppose us a message to protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position or she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my position that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I called her out on it many times in our debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare\nTo do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them hall hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on ... any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagine what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a\n... it will devastate folks who are\nOr who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nBut you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turning us into one ... right", "year": "2018",
