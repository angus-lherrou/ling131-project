{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "Every ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff as a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of man this but it also does show a desperation that is now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point does it matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nAnd the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't you candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in and about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWith the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over and Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at\nYou know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read a John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and\nThe only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank once was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening\nTurned out not to be true it turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut there's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen one year\nBefore the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty and twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms\nRolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine feet Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party\nGoing to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six said this is a this is all white flash CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that\nNone of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could win\nOr give me a deep let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe GOP claimed a similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nThey were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nSuspect foundation problems Colby experts cold ram jak evaluations are free costs seven three five three zero eight five that seven three five

results come in but I just going back to Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen his what Nate Silver is five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much Democrats eked out victories in those states\nAnd picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty seats and keep their majority Democrats can also pick up seats from the G O P in Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or probable but far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine\nDonald Trump didn't want a single state according to the polls\nJohn Kerry was going to be president because of the polls\nNow I don't have a crystal ball\nAnd I just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always wanna play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district check out my website see if you're in one of those key pivotal\nTip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ... if you vote for a Republican maybe you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall\nYou know if you both for any democratic senator you just voting for Schumer it'd be a vote for reticent McCaskill Nelson\n... uh Joe Donnelly cinema you vote for any of the test or you're voting for Schumer

the\nTerrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly is twisted it is sick it is the family story\nAnd frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable\nAnyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God\nIn a temple and their gun now\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWell the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his Ron ... said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children\nIn a synagogue\nUnbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty\nMuch anything and everything that is Donald Trump you know the rabbi set on CNN Trump is my\nPresident he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was home with those yesterday you know she expose this is their hateful garbage in broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know it takes a very special anointed person to be that kinda person\nDonald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nThat understands the evils and the threats of radical Islam and especially Iran\nAnd the mainstream media Democrats speaking with one voice\nTrump but this horrific attack Dana Milbank writing Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews\nWhat a lie what a slanderous disgusting despicable lie also in the Washington Post an editor writing you know Trump has talked the fears of those like Bower one columnist\nThe New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least\nOf all by them blaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supporter of president of Israel and the Jewish community\nThe monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a happen to have Trump why because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel\nAnd Bowers posting online is hatred in contempt for Trump because of its support for Israel but yet the mainstream media's coverage that doesn't matter\nAt one you know CNN and ... you know GQ correspondent saying that the president is worse than ISIS I think you know the fact that at\nOne of the things that have really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rat on radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I separate dead I think the president has far more supporters hailed as fast as an equally hateful ideology\nAnd CNN and it's unbelievable she says well\nMy comment served ... that's all we've heard all weekend\nAnd then you get fake\nNews president Jeff Zucker lecturing the president on rhetoric and civility this is his network every second minute hour of every day it's anti Trump\nThen that idiot hump the dump the you know who is basically the you know\nSpokesmen for soccer ... over the weekend as a guest we played some of those yesterday saying oh Hannity's responsible for the violent actions\nDeranged individual when

because I think they realize that this is an important race for the future of Florida that's good news for us\nWell you got you running for Rick Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved well\nThis guy was posing as a developer or he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gifts and end up itself Andrew never reported it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in cell assay and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah\nWhy wasn't interested isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged that New York junk get paid for a for a night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can report that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it only interested in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal\nApartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when\nA Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attack as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief hindrance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida or they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be funded they say they say to us is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement there in the free enterprise there and the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridian that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and to force them to be on this single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose businesses and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nThey'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on while biting Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids that down there I mean I've got to believe would this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate a they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents dad relief after he lied in the debate last

better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nYou can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors\nAre and how many patients you have a we

that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation\nIt's about upholding the constitution okay nobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confers birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it\nSo the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on executive no you can't\nChange that constitution by executive order what does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal\nAliens of course it doesn't which all explaining a minute that hears\nThe current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges ... New Jersey who say the same exact thing ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did and twenty Fifteen over three years ago we\nCan go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation on understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there are more than a evidence to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago\nAnd he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west as a Leno growl yeah has professor at the University of Texas law school maybe more than them the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment God\nHave after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying he said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment of course and did it as my contention I kinda was exercise that power on many occasions the most recently in immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise that\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act ...

began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\nIs my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of National Review is he's wanted to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified I was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't\nReally in my humble opinion address the issue\nCaught up following the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nA convincing a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens and then we have\nPaul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr boosts and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order\nWho is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back in ... to interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\n... who's changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he writes over a conservative reviewer and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\n[noise] oh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the loss of your patriot dead he's a he's in a better place\nThank you um you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd hit the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want to ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have\nActually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive early but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... list and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant\nAnd nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right um even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one came all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is that a lot so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat the cars in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nIt's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I can see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nA hundred for nine sixty three hundred we'll be
