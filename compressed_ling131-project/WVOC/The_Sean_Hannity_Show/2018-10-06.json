{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "To watch uh the Senate as they are in session that is happening right now we expected a some protest obviously we've seen the scene played out outside the capital all day long from um and there are police I'm a security personnel right outside Reno's public galleries\nUm in order to remove these these protesters are as a as they make their voices heard\nMurkowski Lisa Murkowski not voting will want to hear this\nStir Murphy and things you just voted present a memory gave a lot of the parliamentary I'm sticking\nOur nation that we expected but again the idea of Lisa Murkowski pairing her vote or was that she would\nUm uh allow your deference to her colleague um ... the Republican from from a Montana who has been a strong supporter of of the confirmation of a ... ...\nVote tally now stands at third round the thirty five it will take a simple majority for confirmation of bread rounds\n\nSir Rubio\nI'm not sure John decker if you've heard the interview with Mitch McConnell on a Fox News channel a little bit before the Senate but he suggested that he and the president had talked an awful lot after that second hearing and never wavered on on their ... um supportive of Brett Kavanaugh um it was no talk between him and the president he set of\nOf pulling the nomination I assume that's pretty consistent with your reporting with how the White House has handled this show very unique nomination nominee\nWell that's right the White House digging in its heals over Brett Kavanaugh all over the course of the past few ... even a one at times over the course of the past few will his nomination was in doubt I was outside during a for the president's departure when that interview was played on Fox News channel but you may know\nThat Senator McConnell gave an interview as well to the Washington Post I read that interview and in that interview he again reiterated that at no time were you any doubt that they would stick with Brett Kavanaugh has their nominee van\nHollen or Chris Van Hollen of Maryland a casting his votes is Warren\nWas the Warren of Massachusetts the White House prices are no votes um we're waiting for for the wicker\nNumber here to to reach majority simple ... with Ninety nine senators voting as we expect would react if the Kavanaugh sitting at forty nine right now\n\nThe vice president presiding over the United States Senate\n\nAnd that should be my vote\nSenator from Montana\nSen again is ... this is Lisa Marie gambling Ireland if ...\nIf he were president ... he would have voted I\nI had voted no\nRepair will not change the outcome I developed I dare for withdrawn they thought the senator has that right\n\nSenators voting in the permitted\nAlexander ... so ... through the tally you had heard the explanation fire from\nLaw Murkowski or a Republican from Alaska explaining\nThat if the game for the Republican ... from Montana where president he would have voted yes late and guarding the\nGround is opposed they would vote no but you allow or his vote to count without him being here because it does not count as he is voting rights act and made that announcement and you heard the virus in and say the senator has that right that is something that does not happen very often in the United States Senate ... used to be a tradition that was more frequently than it is\nA recently called carrying\nA ... vote I Believe the last time it happened was we were when he's fourteen and it is a ... when you have senator sometimes of the same party sometimes of different parties that are on two different ends of the wave of the vote and\nFor one reason or another Senate or can't be there and and they find a partner to to pair with two are not change the outcome in any meaningful way and that is what we just saw him as you made the earlier point John\nUm it is a sense of of comedy a sense of unity that is the explanation that Lisa Murkowski gave last night when she explained that she was going to do this threat Ryan\nOr at least bit by bit or store um some of the the the ... nature of the United States Senate has really been tested or over the last few weeks of his nomination Gillibrand\nWill keep in mind that college will nature maybe back to where it needs to be on the Republican Ron died I don't think it necessarily there between the parties are because of what has happened over the past few weeks it's going to take our time\nA Senator Flake is ... about that he wants to do something ...\nTo ... that process board of ... ringing I guess you could call it a more film a camaraderie or within the Senate certainly it's not it's a place where senator has lake who spoke about this on the Senate floor and also during that Judiciary Committee hearing white I Want it to be a that something it's going to take\nAs I said you're a quite some time especially when you consider we have some mid term elections upon us for weeks I Believe from today and so the partisanship only going to increase in the weeks to come\nAs it stands right now with no senators change their vote we believe that vote tally is fifty to forty eight fifty yes votes to forty eight no votes that would can from\nOnce this vote is official Brett Kavanaugh is an associate justice on the United States Supreme court senator Danes Republican from Montana not voting is he attends his daughter's wedding Senator Murkowski explaining\nHer reason for voting present because of Danes absent so they are still\nWorking through the vote tallies making everything official um before this vote is called but as we expected or the votes appear to be there for Brett Kavanaugh that upcoming associate justice of the United States Supreme court but John there's a a little bit of formality of a little bit of paperwork a few other things that have to be done before\nA Brett Kavanaugh will be addressed as Mr justice right\nThat's right he of course still needs to take the oath he needs to get sworn in the White House indicating that could happen as early as this Monday\nBut that is a federal holiday so perhaps were making a Tuesday when he's sworn in and of course you know this already Jared the Supreme Court a session this term the Supreme Court has already begun began the first Monday in October this past\nOn day so a judge and soon to be called justice Kevin all will have missed much when he finally takes his place as the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme Court\nProbably will be able to catch up and it's too old so I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not\nJust the one that you are correct that's correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that uh\nUh Brett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course there was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt looks like or many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking hands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader\nMitch McConnell who is um had a pretty broad smile for most of the day is you can imagine getting this confirmation through it has not been the easiest road we're waiting for that vote total to be announced by the vice president who's presiding over the Senate Mike Pence\n\nLooks like he's got the gamble in hand which usually is indicative of an announcement about to be made by the presiding officer um other senators now now moving about as well as this vote is about to become official fifty yes votes forty a no vote confirming\nBrett Kavanaugh on to the United States Supreme court\n\nAnd we continue to wait ... sometimes ... there is a little bit of formality and procedure that takes place with the Senate votes particularly on these\nAre very important ones you want to make sure every US Senator has just been counted everything's been counted the correct way before you\nYou drop dead gamble but this was an outcome that was expected after those procedural votes yesterday in the announcements\nThat came following from US Senators are Collins and mansion and flake um the loan or a Republican no votes are coming from Lisa Murkowski who is changing her vote to president Mr Carr indifference to Senator DeMint\n\nCarper no [noise]\n\nSounds like they are working their way through I was a senators are beginning to leave the floors to that would be an indication John that\nUh they believe their their work here is finished um regardless of of the outcome that they favor or oppose um it has been interesting to watch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator\nThe Robie white decision and said that she would not confirm a Supreme Court justice who she felt would be hostile to roe v Wade and she announced her support for Brett Kavanaugh yesterday or that vote was considered key to his ultimate confirmation here's a little bit\nOf how Susan Collins explained how she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nThat date it's complicated furthered by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a try\n[noise] but I'm getting in a legal principle that you press\nThe print Samson a in a sense and their guilt there on my thinking and I can not a band and that\n\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have\nBeen leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocal early not true uh brought out a second hearing\nA in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and uh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford 'em and ultimately you heard that they're having a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of\nOf ah the Susan Collins the Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe ... man [noise] you could [noise]\nClearly a learning channel [noise] but [noise]\nIn my country [noise] want to get into the gate with my country [noise] I could not concluded that he is the right person for the court [noise] time\n\nThat was the limitation of Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to appear at which the Danes Montana Republican who wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a vote of fifty\nTo forty eight it is one of the narrowest votes ever for Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtest a shouting from the gallery but ah at the end of the day the Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we've seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but\nUh did a soon to be justice Kavanaugh will will become a member of\nWill that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past\nI Would say almost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital a will take the place of and uh it's thought that Kavanaugh will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see\nThat swing vote emerge\nA during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young he is\nAnd we talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now just just a soon to be justice cabin on now judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court\nOn the fifth quarter post game show\nOn the home of the best game coverage news radio five sixty WBFO see if you want to talk to us nine seven eight nine seven eight nine eight six to\nSouth Carolina and Missouri and another lightning delay had another lightning strikes so reset the clock they'll keep waiting out the rain or lack there of waiting out the lightning but pops I watched this game all day\nAnd from from start to where we are right now and then after last week I was you know pretty critical of the defense for the most part not only on the show but also a during the week just talking to people but today they've been just\nTerrible in the run defense I'll just say it but there's been a bright spot\nAnd I think that the best player at least in the secondary for sure but maybe in the defense is a whole is your freshman quarterback Jaycee horn\nWho has had a couple of past break up there was a to point conversion early end up with the third quarter where he broke it up on a tight end up probably outsized him by about three inches maybe thirty or forty pounds\nUm what have you seen from this guy a true freshmen who started game one ... have you seen that development and him as a corner and and do you agree that maybe he's the best player on this event\nYeah most definitely a horn place with a lot of poison confidence uh um and he gets he seems to uh watch a lot of film he learned from his mistakes\nUm and he's he's not afraid to take chances are I'm I've been impressed with him in contact today with a a lot of plays in a in past breakups but yeah specifically harm because uh again as a freshman or to play at that level is uh something special because it shows a a command of the defense and in confidence in yourself\nAnd ... not only him but I think right now Williams has been flying around a there was a play and the first half\nA screen past that was covered up well Locke had to readjust roll back to his right and the ability for Williams to stay in his gap and wait on lock to basically make a decision and unable to react to it and make the wrap up and\nIn the drive I thought it was extremely important considering how it just seems like this defense for the most part has been out of touch maybe mentally on some place I thought that was really solid play\nUp so Bryce and now we just had a really good day as well shred green had that interception return for a touchdown where the running back falls down and the monsoon and he's just you know he broke on the ball perfectly to make a play any ways to\nGet to take six and that's the only the fourth interception\nOr for South Carolina this season um ...\nWhere while we're talking about the defense has has another penalty in terms of an sportsman like how to pass interference in the end zone early in the game\nA seems seems to me there was shot fans either a allowing a completion or getting called passing her parents are very few times it's in between that maybe a little exaggeration but it's the case as it may be a bit South Carolina's defense\nHas been able to buckle down inside the twenty which I mean you think about it they gave up to feel goals in the first half pops but if not for those to feel go that's two touchdowns and boom this game is way out of reach for South Carolina\nYeah they've they've been banned or ... or ... but ah don't break in the red zone so uh that's a saving grace for today but uh I'm a uh a lot of times it's just in the run deep and start getting gashed on a I'm not able to uh to maintain gap integrity I'm not able to uh ... again like I said to keep containment on the edge\nOr so of the run game's been a bear to up you know try to get a handle on today and that's what's really hurting them so hopefully uh after we come out of this weather breaking get back to play uh hopefully there will they'll make some adjustments that are going to stop this run because uh you know frankly we haven't been able to to tackle the cold today so\nI really haven't yeah they really haven't as we mentioned this game is in another lining to lay so we're going to take a break on the other side will go to the best of Sean Hannity until this delay as over one says over we'll play the final two minutes of the game and then we'll be back for the quarter post game show

[noise] over the Missouri Tigers and South Carolina [noise] um battle through\nToday and a lot happened throughout the course of this\nBall game that we will get to throughout our program again the number to call nine seven eight WBRC nine seven eight nine eight six to you can follow me on Twitter adjusting be hall tweet me there we can talk or you can talk to pops on Twitter as well and I am Tim Frisbee eighty nine South Carolina came into today's game down there starting quarterback who\nA lot of you who are within the sound of my voice didn't want to start anymore anyway so you try it out to fit your senior quarterbacking\nA we mentioned is on that last Dr pops we're watching it\nUm the fact that it took\nA fifth year senior that by the way all this is a quarterback Steve Spurrier recruited\nCame in with and and when this game and drove this team down the field or listen coming out of the delay South Carolina's deep inside thought had a heck of a stand there against Missouri and forced them to kick up fifty seven your field goal and you tip your cat to uh\nTo McCann for the Missouri Tigers to kick that deal goal and and make it look easy and doing so or to give them a lead and you get the ball on your own thirty one and you drive right down the field and I'm kudos to ah Mr Kemp Frisbee right here beside makers pops you called that seem\nPattern to the tied into their mark way at the end of that game you said you got to go to the tide in here you haven't done it all day long and they did so who do you have on the phone there that you were given up like all the\nI didn't have anybody on the phone but I knew if a again we talked about coming out of that or the that the weather delays now you had when we talk about more specifically defensively you had an hour and a half\nTo come up with a a defensive strategy to basically a big fence about eight plays that uh Missouri was going to have\nA that seemed to work out pretty good with the game Cox living a Missouri to a field goal but\nWhat we didn't talk about too is you also had an hour and a half to scheme up some or all offensive plays that we're going to be successful against these Missouri Tigers and again you always want to use the element of surprise you having use somebody all day\nYou want to break that out and I knew that was a perfect position for a a tied in to come out on the scene play a boom down a field that gets us into a field goal range in the rest is history what Parker white but again like you said earlier we fought through a lot of adversity today a lot of um you know other conditions or weather delays\nI'm not specifically being able to uh stop there are certain things with our defense but uh in the end of a maintain and what we talked about it in one of my tweets were able to survive\nAnd it just survive and the fact that South Carolina was able to get out of here with the wind and everything that they dealt with today but by the way this was not a flawless performance by any stretch of the imagination but these are the kinds of games when you win them this is what that team did last year we were talking about what the differences between these two\nBetween this team in the one from last year um the the team last year was able to get the turnovers was able to make the big stands defensively and in this case\nThis when they got the drive to to win it nine plays fifty three yards a minute sixteen off the clock they had a minute and Eighteen or so heading into that drive and they were able to set up Parker white who had to go through an ice rink situation I'm surprised that Missouri didn't use their last time out why not\nUm you you can't roll 'em over to the next game when I was when you don't make them think about it one more time\nUh I Believe that's about the same spot where he kicked out one against Louisiana attack last year may be wrong but you got it within forty\nAnd Parker was able to knock one through and again the narrative now is you if your office and get in a position inside that forty or rage park is probably going to hit it so that's a good situation for South Carolina to be an end again a great win for South Carolina today thirty seven thirty five over\nThe Missouri Tigers now South Carolina's three and two and we had a lot to break down from scar ... to the defense all that stuff nine seven eight WBRC nine seven eight nine eight six too but of course we have to start with one of our favorite color Adam is on the line Adam what's up man\nHe doing that was a crazy gamma gladly want but at the fence my gosh that was that they should um Missouri could put me out they went to a yard there and we got him to that next week [laughter] same quarter\nYeah yeah you really do you really have to improve their on that side of the ball or defensively by the way Adam for what it's worth you had more tackles than the south Carolina defense did today and they will contact yes even you because South Carolina just couldn't wrap up whether whether it was around tree or or any of those guys they just didn't have the ability\nOn the fifth quarter post game show\nAnd all of the best game caught coverage news radio five sixty WBRC number to call nine seven eight WBRC nine seven eight nine eight six to South Carolina thirty seven thirty five win\nOver the Missouri Tigers and we talked before the break about Michael scar neck in a just his ability to control the fence and make the play is necessary\nUh to to make things happen for the game Cox today especially on that last drive and we mentioned ... after the Kentucky game Brian Edwards had some drops debo Samuel how to drop on the first drive on a dig\nA debt you know he's caught about a hundred thousand of those in this time of Caroline and just dropped that one bad game to do so but everyone was dropping and it seemed like and then you um\nToday's game Brian bounces back well and so does ... both guys are targeted well depot for catches eighty eight yards touchdown\nBrian Edwards seven catches Seventy three yards two touchdowns\nAnd one on the little back shoulder or I don't wanna quarterback shoulder fade but it basically was and then of course the slant where he was able to fight through and and reach for the end zone ... touched down as well on a on a slant shy Smith three catches for thirty two yards the catch of the day was Kyle walkway\nOne reception for twenty seven yards but you had a multiple guys\nCatching the ball being targeted that's another thing it's going to keep his able to do today is spread that ball around he was he was looking for guys all over the field but again the ability by Brian Edwards to bounce back today after a tough Saturday in Lexington last week\nYeah yeah I'm impressed with Edwards because he sometimes he makes the difficult catches look easy and makes the easy cash has looked very difficult\nAnd a bit a couple of those today a drop some what you would consider easy catches but then made some a great uh over the middle catches when he took big hits was able to uh hold on to the ball a again a ... a impressive ah with the going through his reads again like you said being able to distribute that ball\nOr across the field but let's give a little credit\nTo the past blocking of the office of line to allow him to do that and a sort of his presence in the pocket or use the pocket well was able to step up and there are and make some to some throws a didn't get the happy feet in there so\nA divine held up pretty well I'm On the other passing plays allowing a we've secrets or get into their routes had a little difficulty on a\nAh picking up the blitz is a but against correctly it was able to to get rid of the ball up pretty quick and recognize those Blitzer so I'm the overall a a pretty good day from the from the office\nIt was still an inability of sorts to run the ball um with the frequency that that you know and who who cares I have to say but I Would like it to be run with that so um I think there's still a\nA real clamoring in my heart of hearts as a football fan for there has there ... there just has to be a guy who can consistently run the ball and run it well\nAnd run it consistently now I don't know if it's something in ... Tyson Williams is your most talented running back\nThat same period there's gotta be something that practice like\nCan you just try harder and practice at that issue like just just come ready to practice if that's the problem because if he's starting for you at the beginning of every game my goodness the the the physicality you would establish would be unreal so South Carolina I think that's another thing that you're going to have to keep trying to get cleaned up and you're gonna have to be hard headed with it it's going to be tough\nThey had a hundred and twenty yards rushing it but he was only forty seven carries whereas that's pretty bad\nYeah and sometimes we have to be a I think what we're trying to sue to force a a a around\nA round peg in a square hole or vice versa but uh what sometimes for going through that run to just making making it like we have to establish to run and then we get we get a quickly out on some of these series because we're forcing that\nTake was given to you sometimes you just gotta take what's given to you up and up and take your shots down feel that if they're going to give you to pass because they're stacking up against or run knowing you've been having difficulty run it will take that and then that'll free up some lanes for your running that so you know take what they give you know they don't give it to you and and uh you you take advantage of that\nAbsolutely no let's go to the defense is out here for a little bit ah South Carolina gave up thirty five points today that bad\nI don't think you wanna get my thirty points you you you would really like to keep it around twenty four under which they did last week but here's why that's so important South Carolina in their losses this season pops is pretty cool in the third quarter had been out scored Twenty one to seven\nIn their wins\nThey have scored let me do quick math forty one points and he'll opponents to three\nForty one to three in the third quarter of their wins um which speaks to reach out maybe we challenged coaching a little bit last week I think that goes to adjustments and really the one glaring one is Georgia Twenty one nothing\nOr whatever they haven't allowed a third quarter point since that George game um and three points they've allowed in the third quarter in their wins that that was against coastal in week one so\nFor what it's worth I think this this coaching staff is doing a really good job of finding that that one little thing that they need to correct defensively and often simply that they're coming out and establishing something and the third quarter which\nImmediately get if you're at home and get your crowd right back into it and if you're on the road gives your side line a little bit of a jolt and a little bit of momentum so good for South Carolina to come out and stabbed wish that again today Seventeen nothing run in the third quarter\nYeah what's concerning though is that uh we're we're very good at making those adjustments at halftime or as you saw in this game or during the long break\nWeren't great at making these adjustments when we have a break to do it we're not so good at making them on the fly it at that that's concerning you should be able to ah bring your defense of leader over whoever it is\nMake your adjustments on the fly and say look we need to change just ... instead of letting series by series go by and the same things happening so uh I don't I don't really get that that why we can't do that but ah that that's the only concern with that but it's glad where we are able to make adjustments at the half\nAnd then the least support 'em into effect in the third quarter\nAnd maybe that goes back to what we've been talking about I feel like since a week to is the fact that South Carolina I don't know if you have that leader\nYet mad that I don't I really don't wanna throw off on Bryson does it fit your guy probably should be but he ... he used to play maker\nUm maybe that guy's becoming Jaycee horn\nIf you were able to tune in to us for a little bit coming off the cabin all stuff and we had a little bit of time during the day we talked a little bit about I Believe the Jaycee horn is the best player on the Stevens right now\nAs it stands now wants DJ want 'em comes back who knows but I feel like right now a JC horns your best player in this at least in the secondary maybe ... von ... could be your best on the line or second best overall\nBut he was really locked out and I think he's going to eventually by the end of the year really sees that role that leader on the defense is on the ball\nRight and and we were able to get a little bit better pressure\nA field against a a Missouri today against lock\n'em I think it's going to come down so we have to make those adjustments in Iran game do because we've been getting slashed all year on teams that are are bent on Iran\nOr so that we just have to ... you know figure out something there I don't know if it's death or if it's just a you know players not playing their techniques are their assignments but that that that has to be an adjustment has been a\nIt has to be South Carolina with the wind thirty seven thirty five over Missouri they moved to three and two on the season\nGet their four hundred all time when at home you're listening to the fifth quarter post game show in the home of the best game caught coverage news radio five sixty WBRC\nYou're listening to the best coverage on news radio five sixty WVU see [noise]\nA long time in South Carolina had been some convenience stores are mice in the competition by giving you a free\nI mean that's right very I just like any in the back of beer and get a brief pin pound bag of ice in Chile down then dumped convenience stores or your tailgating headquarters with everything you leave for the big game and right now you'll get a ... by virtue of any age thing here one bag\nWere burned a flea watery eyes does I'm Joe you're up\nThis is a laser Kaufman Clinton and it is my favorite time of the year it's time for football and that means time to tailgate come see us at the meeting place it costs money and we guarantee that you will have the most popular tailgate at the stadium she's from great steaks ribs chicken hamburger patties hotdogs and are delicious chili and don't forget\nI don't know what the injury is I don't think anyone does just because they don't say these things much champ keeps them very close which is fine um if he wasn't healthy to go today\nI wouldn't bet only being ready next Saturday either\nI'm just because if it's that much of an issue with the knee could be I was I don't know it could be an M C L I don't know they could you know could be just about anything with that and he could be a de bumpers we don't know and it was a non contact injury which you know makes it even worse so if he's not ready to go again I think you feel very comfortable with who you had a quarterback\nMichael Jordan actually went out there and three three touchdowns today no interceptions it's pretty impressive a lot of crazy stuff going on in college football\nToday a lot of games going on and Rob standards going to give us a big scoreboard update here a lot going on in college football\nWe do a lot going on in the college football world right now clumps and no problem at Wake Forest right now it's thirty five to nothing they are about midway through the third quarter a tiger off and it's getting the job done stay travesty TNN is over a hundred and Seventy yards on ah ten carries\nAnd he has three touchdowns right now Florida leads LSU fourteen to ten at the\nHalf Florida State in Miami or ah let's see a forest date as a twenty seven lead over Miami that's a score I didn't see coming number twenty five Oklahoma State is losing right now to Iowa State thirty seven to twenty eight at the\nOhio State leads Indiana twenty eight to twenty also at the half number Twenty one Colorado in Arizona State or tied at fourteen\nAnd other finals from earlier today number one Alabama wins over Arkansas sixty five to thirty one number Nineteen Texas with a big win over Oklahoma forty eight to forty five\nNumber nine West Virginia wins over Kansas thirty eight to twenty two number Fifteen Michigan wins over Marilyn forty two Twenty one northwestern gets the upset over Michigan State twenty nine to Nineteen now or twenty three Boston\nOh it's wins a skews me number twenty three NC State wins over Boston College twenty eight to twenty three tons of sky in Miami is losing to Florida State by Thirteen Yes sir oh my gosh it's Miami that bad well Mayes are more when they see\nMore though you know I completely disagree with you on that front there possibly cause I think we have a society where everyone thinks if the SEC is just so much better and it's really not\nI mean we can have that debate at some point but if you look at the absolute numbers and you look at strength of schedule and the fact that Alabama in the so called best of the west don't schedule home and homes with anybody else you can definitely make the argument that not that the ACC is better\nBut to the SEC is not up on this perks that everybody thinks that it is ... well\nWe we we can we can have the debate I just find out well for you I mean ... why would you say at home and home with someone when you're playing Florida Auburn Fifteen team because under that under that mentality then then you're thinking like you're from the Big Ten and then she beat up on people and the Big Ten and then the Big Ten is awesome that's what you're trying to get across with the SEC\nWhat you should do is the Rob Sanders NASA district the schedule you have you had your aid conference games you have three games against\nPower five teams you have to schedule homeland home not like what Alabama does well they scheduled teams that are in the uh you know neutral sites you don't do that\nAnd then you have one game against an in state\nI think it you know a lot of that neutral site though comes from the money that does neutral sites generate now right but I'm not talking about neutral site and money on TALK it out what's best for college football I don't really care about the money I won't I won't more home and home I won't if anybody's on while I won't more home at home then you don't want to be a fan of the SEC because SEC coaches don't want to do that\nBecause they live on this illusion that they're in the SEC and they're better than everybody\nElse well I I mean and I guess again that's arguable I wouldn't sit much say it was an an illusion or when you uh you look at these us the strength of schedule or where to look at look at stricter schedule has been in the past five years if you look at it that well not this year that's for sure\nWe don't know until the season is over and then you figure out how many right teams they play at the end of the season\nWell and we're going to figure that out watch at the end of the season of the their schedule isn't it not much better at this point in probably UCF and UCF got up to up is don't play a very good schedule either yet they run in their mouths at the end of the fees are national champion like yeah like the international champions come on now\nUp in a really compare in front of a schedule I think he's the F ... no one no what I'm saying is look at based on the ACC this year it's almost like that like last year as a you know UCF play knows JV teams in claiming up well we do we want I'm also you know we should have this a shot at the national title\nIn Virginia Tech beat Notre Dame tonight which they very well could six point ... average at it that when would be huge for the conference right Florida State ... beating Miami would not be good for the ACC just because it's just cannibalizing itself getting less and Clinton's got a road\nThey go undefeated there in a no doubt about it they're going to play a top twenty five team in North Carolina state they've played a very solid team in Texas ... who's only other losses to mind our eyes to Alabama to um ... Boston College as a fringe team um and then you're going to play either Virginia Tech or Miami and the ACC Championship game right which\nIs about the same as you have with with Florida and a few others um\nSo this this debates pretty interesting ... in terms of what we are talking about what strength the strength of schedule excuse me ... and a Clemson in the FCC and the ACC and and so on and so forth but now\nLet's head over to Williams Bryce stadium in here from the head coach after her win over Missouri thirty seven thirty five let's go to one must champ\nWow what a game wild game\nYou know you talk in terms of guts and toughness and resolve on your football team within your organization that's what you're talking about you're talking about\nThe team that continued to fight regardless of circumstances going into the game and regardless of circumstances during the game whether it's whether the layer of poor play poor coaching whatever you want to call it God's continued to fight you know you\nOught to make your while to being in the garden and block in my opinion so really proud of our football team um [noise]\nYou know just to to hang in there and do the do what you have to do to win games and that's what we did we put outstanding red zone defense and the first half her run defense needs to be a really looked at what we're doing I'm disappointed there they had no third down conversions and the second half\nAnd all of a sense we kept chipping away you know kept chipping away play through the ...\nThe uh the weather which is tough times obviously the to block punch were critical but they also had some issues on their side because of who is the weather as well but I'm so proud of football team part of being a game called can continue to fight never quit and that does a lot about this football team that appreciate the fans stayed throughout\nA and it was certainly is allows it could be there in the fourth quarter we appreciate them you know sticking through a couple of ... rain delays in or what not to wear too but a hell of a day to be a game called go in\nThere\nAnd never got its head down and and it never look bad I mean Scott it's fifty seven yard or even then did you see any editing and\nGuys get only you know kept and we knew he was a really good kicker coming in all of us are are you know we talk to our guys about stuff like that they understood that and he's really good kicker and certainly and right before he uh the the ten minute warm up to a stop before we went to the second or to finish the game there he hit one from the same distance winner\nFar to coach but just to go through the process of of making the call this car next year it was good yeah lay and then also update folk somewhere Jake stance\nWell Jay was clear to play today from the standpoint it would probably be limited uh you know my biggest concern is in any situation with the student athletes can they protect themselves on game day\nAnd a and I have a huge concern for that personally uh so uh you know he he was probably could have gone out there and done some things I don't know he's been limited you know to be honest with you I don't know more probably Tuesday of of next week where his status is might got the majority of the rats we got confidence in my we've always had confidence Mike\nOr he's never been asked to do it in that stage and he performed extremely well uh\nYou know you think about in terms of being a a first time starter and under that whether a that's pretty daunting task and he did a fantastic job he converted some critical third bounds especially in the second half to keep drives alive\nYou know at times it was difficult as far as the ball handling and things were concerned we're trying to get a ... as much as we could so was Missouri oh but it's when you when you're under those circumstances it's hard especially for a first time starter so I'm sure they're proud of him\n[noise]\nHow can you is that the most bizarre game you've ever involved ... I'd probably be number one\nHow did you guys have to adjust\nTo control what you can control we can't control the weather we talked our players all the time and organization control things you chose a different life\nLife is unfair you know have things have happened to you and we you know I Try to balance football in life with our guys all the time I talk to him after the game you know respond you know ten percent of what's happened since what you do about it you got to respond in like thinks he's going to go against you know that's part of it so what now what\n\nWhat is the conversation like during that the labor you guys are in that high high energy tense moment and then all of a sudden you have to break and then all of a sudden you have to come back and just as used by man\nYou got to get to choose back in a choice\nYou know go back and we went over the just missed the first time we went back on the field they chose to go back in those ... those give them about eight minutes and let them eat a little bit and give some foods back in their bodies were going to go back and they were going to do it again and that's what we did our guys came out responded we've been in that situation multiple times now so it's it's a more guys understand\nToday personified that in my opinion in terms of their ability to fight through the adversity and make the place and they needed to not everything went there way defensively um\nBut they were able to pull out a win in the end and through the personal fouls Neal sportsman like conduct send some still some more drop balls by by Brian Edwards and and uh a few others believe it was Tyson Williams out of the backfield at one point who let one get out of his hands um but just a good overall wind that you that you needed in a three game homestead\nYeah yeah and ah you know people in ... you know they're going to have to realize are getting like you said you're only one game off projected their projected path so far for this year a\nYou know they're going to be affected by a lack of debts on this team by or the lack of overall talent we do have some talented players obviously in different positions on this field or on his team a we have the potential\nOf these players are going to get much better they've done a great job recruiting so we're starting to fill the coffers with uh the types of player of that much champ up once for his team he's brown they brought in coordinators\nAre to kind of go against some of the ... a path said he's gone before that take a different approach towards the fence so I mean all all arrows pointing up a but it's a process\nAnd I think ah we see a little bit of this process today because you can't question to hard and you can't question the effort\nOr the other team put forward today there's going to be mistakes and again you're going to see a difficulty is based on his lack of depth and in some of the town of but they are they seemed to remain in the fight for the most part\nThey they they fall that's the best way you can say it is they're just bought their tails off today I Try to get that when you give up the the ... puts Missouri ahead without a little over a minute minute change left in the game and he got a guy who's never started before on his own thirty one you've got to try to matriculate your way down the field and try to win a ball game\nUm and the ability was there to do that um you mentioned something in there about being one game off and here's why that's important um you know\nWho knows I don't think anyone South Florida being ...\nIt's good [laughter] I don't think anyone salt Texas a and him being as solid as they were against Clemson I think I think if ... if Clinton boat races am I think Caroline vets pretty confident heading into next week we'll find out more about them tonight for sure um [noise]\nBut is there we can overreact to every week if we want to but you know let's try to take a week to week as it goes\nHas your opinion in sixty minutes a football game time football about five hours of total or did your opinion vastly changed in those sixty minutes about this team and their character or their ability to win these kind of games\nYou know in my opinion was that the this team is always going to be in a fight or they're going to be days or where they're not going to be able to get it done like I said in the previous segment just based on uh the town of level in depth is not quite where a coach must him a nice it yet\nUh but I mean my opinion didn't change I think\nThey can get better weekly or based on the adjustments and based on another game under their belt and that's what this team needs I mean that's why we can we say take a week to week gained the game because there are going to be adjustment you are going to be able to make big make lessons learned and you take those into the next game\nAnd then you hope to a reduced the errors are and some of the things that are or were causing you a pain in previous games and if you can do that uh you know then you're always heading in the right direction 'cause like I said you know that the the heart and a half or it's going to be there with a must chanting\nIt is and you know they're still grumbling about this team's run defense and let's talk about that to renting is fair well that's fair right if it's a terrible and you know\nCoaches will say as much and you know they'll try to fix it I mean what can you do to fix it in a week they if if the players aren't there you can't fix it is immediately as everyone would like it too will get to the run deep and that that's going to be talking about next to the defense and how they insure that up before an a and M. team comes to town next week more on south\nCarolina's thirty seven

getting in the gaps and getting pushed off the ball like crazy there's not a lot of push in the run game defensively for South Carolina and was we mentioned I don't think that's something that's easily correct double it's more about getting the players\nYeah it's assignment football you have to ask you know stay within your assignment or you have to uh you you have to be able to ah to fill those gas a again a assignment football and ... you know\nA one of the things that the we have two of you know we have to talk about when it comes to a ... you know to South Carolina defense\nA and not meeting those assignments that again is that an adjustment factor we talked about earlier a you know they go they come off the field when the officers on they get they get in their meetings\nOr they make their adjustments I don't know if there's\nNot that you know some listening not going on if you're not able to they need a longer period to get through to some of the players but\nThat you know that seems to be a game like we talked about earlier the problem where as a they need to seem like they have to get the halftime or to make those adjustments I like to see that more on the fly and as they get better and you get more depth that I think you'll start to see that\nYou know the defense defense is terrible blah blah blah well where are you at now three into you didn't play your
