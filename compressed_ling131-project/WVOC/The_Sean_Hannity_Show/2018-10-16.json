C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that\nTaxing companies who choose not to elect a pain for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors\nAnd we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh ... and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country\nAnd what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nNeed a new mattress no problem ... comforts are on sale too\nBut what about the pumpkin spiced latte well spring mind to me at this ... each day say you don't have to eat it was ...\nPass it custom furniture and sort of comfort mattresses on sale now at shaping furniture take guy twenty six to exit Ninety One in shaping and look for the big red chair ready to ride the\nBeing boys go to the area we go to Mars is probably a big boy car service for the course of a message like always on big boy cards dot net\nState army born and raised in the heart of South Carolina founded on the idea that accompanies principles should be more important than his profits we do business with the people's dedicate themselves to protecting the innocent and\nTheir families their freedom that's why every other state army firearm periods in unlimited lifetime more because we measure our six\nAnd based on the amount of freedom we can spread not just the amount of dollars we can make ...

California I don't want gathering is in that dark I mean I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he gets ruined city\nWas an eye you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nAnd sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City this even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and and all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is packed that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nBut if people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't and I agree with you and they had on counted on where the thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to state taxes and apparently this\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing to Texas so unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway do you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in the world they'll tell you that on election night three ... three weeks from tonight will

Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nRight and that was the turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so yeah I Know you turn to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress those are grew born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very past tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memo said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps the\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record\nAnd Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now\nHe's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her eye if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safer at this point seems to be Joe\nMansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee writes then\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my guys are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid terms I have gone against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings and you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our\nMillion dollar budget surplus should be used to offer up one time bonuses to about thirty two thousand state workers and fifty thousand public schoolteachers governor McMaster though as opposed to the one time bonuses he says the way to attract and retain quality state workers is to address the unfunded liability in their pension fund\nAnd it's bringing attention to a disease Senator Tim Scott says it's overshadowed and the public sphere the Senate recently passed Scott's bill that calls for more focused on sickle cell disease and other blood disorders Scott says the bill moves the medical community a step closer to finding a cure\nFor a disease that affects thousands now it goes to the house us these annual Carolina class takes

channel twenty five ABC Columbia I'm chief meteorologist John Farley\nJonathan Rauch ... saw that we don't want to take credit for this but it's also the governor was listening to our suggestion and here comes the ugly push back and it's hard next\nThe number is one hundred and Seventy seven million dollars in surplus in the budget\nAnd we have always said you don't actually have a surplus because what you have is a twenty billion dollar under funded state pension\nFund and that's just one of the problems we have which the government that money's yes you don't have a surplus if you've got that kind of problem and so we suggested that extra money go back into the state pension fund for the state employees and the teachers and all that sort of stuff however we hear from\n... in Washington headed to South Carolina state employees association\nWho says that's a horrible idea don't give it to us in our pension give us the cash no you could almost understand the argument given that we are so far in debt and our pension fund that you're going to miss manage the money if you're in government so wide wait for the ... there was no retirement money let's just take our cash now maybe that's what they're thinking\nWell that was the case I Would agree with him but they in fact one the one time bonus plus a five percent cost of living increase and a Fifteen\nPercent pay raise over the next four years for state workers and teachers and I'm not saying they're not worth every cent of that but we're we're we're at we're an Ethiopian tribe trying to figure out how we can get

day\nI mean he may on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio a warmth medium\nThat you're exactly right you're exactly right the shot and the reason that caught was that was known your program yet they find a ... delivery Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion\nSelling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have the pace impressed shut up shut up is still a Democrat\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you don't understand since the day Donald Trump won the left in this country those quote resistance in this country\nNow that now emerging into a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera\nAll of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them\nYou know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that sounds like you\nWant something bad to happen and the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOr ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters Ted said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because then you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it had that Hillary Clinton had the sheet Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian duff the a\n... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with unverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThere is this who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this well Trump said he'd create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation\nAnd opening up bad wire and building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple of

impeach but that's the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the ...\nPeople ... know that there's a lot of states [noise]\nThe Democrats rely on people of low information they rely

report\nOh this is just kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European oh however the report and however the analysis also identified five genetics segments\nAs Native American in origin at high confidence bustamante is analysis places warns Native American ancestry between six ten generations ago with a report estimating eight generations\nUh okay so let's say go and get something here this is where the Boston Globe and they're they're mad really got off track by the way really got off track\nTrying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say a generations ago\nWhat would that equal here and the answer\nElizabeth Warren as it turns out is more lily white been Whitey white folk like perhaps you and me that is what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website\nWhoops now\nAll throughout the course of the day I have heard from my my friends\nStill lives here in the in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the dearth of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average left just want to be socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren commonly received the question will why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be teachers made in one again [laughter] and she I mean this was her O'Neill nobody told her to go out there and get all actually President

think she was like I'd rather take the test and then he or she supposed to be Ivy League educated right when you actually like try to\nFigure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ... ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states just saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down to ball now in the end the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down near\nBan came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck\nAsking junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nWho coined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way\nHe was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's a legitimate use as well also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes the dynamite any questions\nYeah you can have the the president the United states were forward to Elizabeth Warren Abad Pocahontas as he might say as a fraud but really only have to do\nIs listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be a part of Google or a fraud oh by the way I mean details you know these little things so part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of\nIsrael today as well I mean what difference does it make any way in Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the the tax return thing real quick\nSo let's say that at worst you'd think he got something ... Trump's tax returns here's a person who lies literally about who she is and always has and the problem is for folks who say well I mean but who did it hurt old but it wasn't it wasn't a victimless crime\nThere had been problems here as a matter of fact she's used it every step but the way\nTo gain benefit in law school to gain career benefit to identifying as a minority now\nSomewhere there is someone who was supposed to obtain the type of benefit that the bad Pocahontas received by virtue of her using her bowl\nIndian status to obtain financial benefits to obtain status to obtain a

that is Medicare for all\nIt's not just Pocahontas that's abroad Medicare for all which is also pushing for is the fraud\nParty it's a very odd Andrew Gillum running for governor in Florida on a

comes from the trustee trustee Medicare does he after the or not so Affordable Care act was passed\nAnd you have the Democrats that diverted Medicare money we went from seeing a Medicare begin insolvency in their twenties thirties to well\nTwenty twenty six so we're just eight years away from Medicare saying uh yeah you know one nine percent of the benefits year one are going to go away and it gets worse from there\nNow you have the president United States has not ... afraid to say it's a fraud so for all the people that go yeah you know I was just over there smoking some dope and Elizabeth war is making a lot of sense right now for that person\nHey make sure they don't vote if you can now but because we should not have a yeah everybody else I I might get off on the dance real

right now or whether I'm going to tackle that coming up and the third our the show today\n[noise] funny thing about how ignorant Taylor Swift actually has about Tennessee politics and health fake her tendency values are in fact you might say that there were Swiss Tennessee values are about as fake as I don't know Elizabeth Warren's Native American roots but I digress because I was telling you about the Medicare for all fraught again\nFifteen Percent of people on it\nEverybody working paying into it what do you think happens if we put a hundred percent of people on it\nHow's that work since this thing already doesn't work in twenty twenty six uh any questions I mean that's just kind of stuck on stupid if you travel down that rabbit hole and I don't I've never smoked anything\nSo I

Fox News President Trump giving the kingdom the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the disappearance of a journalist in Turkey\nAnd an interview with the Associated Press President Trump compared condemnation of Saudi Arabia to the allegations made against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh saying here we go again you're guilty until proven innocent\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake they made\nLike you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhat it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election\nWell yeah I was up for it it did break for Donald Trump beyond that at since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote yeah thirty\nThousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past two years we have\nFifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there my point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people going out registering to vote and then\nThey're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua twenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you you take a look at the economy we have\nThe best economy in a generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in from a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck the hero bomb and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some eyes are open\nBest the God of me in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right now\nOh by the way but\nAlso have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry leftist that goes yeah but I think they benefit for the tax cuts well that's because you know where you're\nAnd boy are probably date and about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be records out when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit for the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that and two years fans are is if anything he probably is attracted more boats ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI Want to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it\nNow you take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically all these are in great white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd be foreign policies success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we believe cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this bar to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia we actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration\nSay that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying
