I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd that's what senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to

would come out if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response will go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that is exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listened I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people\nBut I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need them the civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interaction but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American values that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nThe Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nBill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nThink the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid to party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to

in the leagues we close on October including lots of updates from that ... east clash\nGoing on in Jacksonville, Georgia is leading not what over Florida right now we'll hear from ... to and get reactions from game ... players and game got beat writer Josh Jindal at the state newspaper will drop by shortly that's all coming up on our best\nGame got coverage is we take you right up to kick off tonight on the SEC Network well let's find out like Carolina fans are talking about after a week away from their team as we bring you gain Cox storylines from spurs and fatter is joining us now\nThe editor of spurs and feathers Jeff Cohen said Jeff course also in a lump all say happy homecoming to you right out of that homecoming and let's talk a little bit about for starters the last time we saw this game got team on the field that was certainly a tale of two halves\nBut for that game ... team against ... yeah it was\nA a probably couldn't avoid a whole lot worse than the first half a\nYou know a hundred and two yards a total all fan so we we threw the ball for forty six hours in the first half of them Thirteen to nothing and then very quickly and the third quarter down sixteen to the un and things look pretty bleak and then all of a sudden they started getting us together they put together a couple of really nice drives they're Jake started complete surpasses\nA would come up with a couple of ... a ... ... Byrd a couple a to point versions and all of a sudden this died and uh things are looking good but er you know they can't they come back put together a temp points in the fourth quarter and we didn't give up we came back and scored again but it was just a little bit too late there but\nYou're right it was a tale of two have let's hope that uh they figured some things out of the second half of that game and there'll be scary word over today\nWhat you said they put it together it was really an issue of Jake Bentley putting it together because he had a disastrous first out yeah he\nDid and in a few weeks project their you know we got hurt and Kentucky game and set out Missouri and then the fans sort of got on\nA you know I think he came out in that game really really\nDetermined and probably under a great deal of pressure to turn things around improving could play well and it didn't do well for\nEarly in the game and he started here it's booze and there's no question he admitted after the game that that did bother him a little bit uh but he put it behind them be regrouped at half time it came out and he probably ... best with all of the season there the third quarter he took among those two drives and and we saw some emotion out of it you\nKnow he was a really fired up when he came to the sideline after that first score and put it together so hopefully we'll see some carry over on that today\nAnd to his credit's will most champ admitted he was not ... was not one hundred percent for that gang\nNo he was and then you could tell he was still hot well a little bit didn't have the mobility that he normally has the he was better than he was a week or but really not a hundred percent and you could tell that he did you know he didn't run the ball that much a what a couple of really ah gutsy boys there where he uh\nHad to run the ball third down and again nine yards on one of them in eight on the other and just really good at it out despite not being a hundred percent and the you know he got his passing down in a ... and really brought them\nBack there Jeff Owens is with is the editor of spurs and feathers Jeff you wrote an article on the website this week talking about what the game ... need to do in order to win tonight and it was a fairly simple thing\nRun the football you know they got to get back to that there's a lot of talk about that during the off week uh\nYou know I think most jet was not happy with uh the way or the number of times that they ran the football gets Texas a and M. but just sort of gave up on it\nUh you know they only ran about Eighteen times the entire game which is kind of hard to believe or what they sort of gave up on it and uh he feels like that's been a problem with the current thing throughout the season that they're not sticking\nWith the run game enough and not trying hard enough to establish the runners or to get caught up in those Arpaio's they're checking off at the wand a scrimmage too much or throwing the ball when the running play is called and sort of just getting away from it so I think there'll be a more concerted effort today to run the football\nOr I look for him to get the ball to both Rico and and toss on William I hope we see a lot of toss on Williams today he has shown some burst I think he is proven throughout the season that he's been the most explosive by\nUh you know he got 'em going early in that game you know we through an interception in the end zone but he got his down there by ripping off a couple of runs and then we hardly saw him any more after\nThat I keep wondering what it is that is holding Tyson Williams back with his coaching staff obviously it's something whether it's this practice habits or the fact that he has a block well on ask plays but something is holding him back because I think he's the best running running back on this\nIt is certainly look that way and he has battled a little bit of an ankle injury I think that's been\nBeen a little bit of problem and I remember one point in the game against a un am where he did ... at one point when he came back so it's been that and I make some other issues as well but I I Would love to see 'em established him because I agree with you I don't think he's been the best most consistent running back we've had this year\nAnd he's certainly the most explosive I mean you talk about a guy who could break long run I\nThink he's it I think Rico you know continues to\nYou know battle injuries and Nixon here there and stuff and he's become more of a grinder he's more of a guy who might get you the first down he's almost developed into that ... type\nOf guy I Do think Rico is better hands out of the fact he does he catches the ball well you'd like to see I'm trying to do that in and we get AJ Turner back today\nAfter missing the game with a concussion and ... you look back to last year a day ... pretty much won this game for us last year by running the football effectively he had the only touched down in the game against Tennessee So we may see him a little bit today but I Would really like to\nTo see a much tablets that run and I like to see more ties up ...\nWith us from spurs and feathers Jeff five games laugh probably a sixth game added in December but you lose tonight there's a lot of pressure on this team with postseason drink beer\nYeah you lose this game tonight and things could go downhill in a hurry because a ... year there's really few opportunities to turn it around you you got tough road road games that old mess which should be a wonderful game\nBut your point on the road and SEC no guarantees for anything we're there and then you face Florida and then you've got ... you got you teach at a new to laugh that's probably the one game you can pencil and as a victory but a ... you lose this game tonight and and things could go downhill and fat as fast if you win it\nUh you got a great shot at turning things around you when this when you go to ... win and then who knows maybe you'll be Florida and you got a chance to still when maybe eight games that we get that last one at the end so this is a critical game seems let me say that every week\nUh but when you're three and three and and you've been inconsistent that is the kind of the ... it's a big game every week\nYeah you're on the game ... schedule and you realize why ... played it fairly close to the vest at this point as to who and winning scheduling that twelve game\nYeah I think you want to keep your options open and I'm sure you get an opponent in here that we can handle it if that game is really critical as far as the bowl games go so a lot is riding on that but uh you need to win this one today no question about you when did that you got a great shot to\nTurn this thing around Geoff good coverage good pictures on your website spurs and feathers dot com\nLike you All right All right to see is always ... editor of spurs and feathers and there you are getting back story lines for tonight's game when we come back coach Eric Wilson and I will take a quick trip around the SEC is we look at what Florida and George are doing and oh yeah by the way don't forget about Kentucky they're playing too and I have a feeling the Wildcats are feeling a little\nProbably a little disrespected this week with all the Florida Georgia talk considering that the Wildcats also control\nTheir destiny within the SEC east plus we'll be talking and hearing from will ... or ... got coverage underway leading up to Carolina and Tennessee across the street officially a seven thirty kick off on the SEC Network and we're back with more in just a moment\nWe're warming up for chick off with more of the fasting coverage on news radio five sixty WVU oh see [noise]\nDo you miss your chance you'll win ... all the little guy or is this one hundred thousand dollar phone home makeover gun hundred grand to spend on your home however you want more Internet WBFO proudly using the word home to\nThat Florida beat earlier this month twelve drank Kentucky\nIs playing at Missouri and it's the tigers on top seven to three that game just into the second quarter let's not forget with all the talk about Georgia and Florida Kentucky also controls its fate in its destiny and the SEC\nSorry Kentucky isn't perfect situation for themselves right now in terms of their ability to dictate where they end up so there's a lot of conversation about this Georgia Florida game because biggest out bill Koch their party and just the fact that it's a huge huge rivalry but Kentucky as a team you got to keep your eyes on\nYou would've thought Kentucky would have come in today's game with a little more chip on their shoulder they were actually an underdog here they are ranked team an underdog headset ... but still that's not a very good Missouri team in the wild cats coming as an underdog and he thought with mark students can't get them up for today but how do you get them up\nYeah I agree with you but I'm In Kentucky is just they're trying to deal with being a better football team traditionally they'd been an underdog forever and and I think they've got to prove that they can win on the road as they move forward\nAnd one of the problems with Kentucky as they become very one dimensional putting it all in the hands of running back then he ... thirty two times last week in that when it gets bandied Missoula lot more balance when they meet Memphis last\nSaturday by the way if you're wondering okay how do you settle that showdown Kentucky Florida and Georgia we know Kentucky is already the lord of the Wildcats will host Georgia\nNext week now time for a look at the wild wild ass ISI west as our friend Wayne Smith joins us from our hearts stations in Birmingham and Wade just one game left on the schedule that involves a team or two teams actually uh with western division ties that is sixteenth drank Texas A M\nAs they are set to visit Mississippi State and I know the bulldogs had been a hard team to get a read on their three games\nThey play three games were lost three games\nFlorida Kentucky and allies you know those are pretty good teams Nineteen and three records yet Joe more heads Mississippi State office just doesn't seem to be making much progress\nThe question you have to ask yourself is it the ... or is it the defense is that they played against that they have lost to being that good that the three laws as you mentioned LSU Kentucky and Florida two of those on the road Florida the only one at home and it was the closest to the match up\nA this team plays well at home but can they get enough often to compete with Texas a and M. they're going to have that they're deep and step up\nAnd ... the somewhere in the twenty to twenty nine point range deceived Mississippi said apple a jet shot at winning this game I don't see them scoring over thirty one point in this ball game I give the lean to Texas than him but it is a road game night in the SEC you just don't know what's gonna happen ... but it's a coin flip to me\nMuch like here in South Carolina ... year old the starting quarterback people thought he would be a lot further along this year especially ... like Joe Morehead that just hasn't happened\nIt really hasn't happened it's kind of been disappointing and it's almost been a regression Phoenix it than that Cheryl this season versus last season\nUh sixty nine at one forty seven on the year for touchdowns and seven interceptions and I look at some of this that the other day and if you look at the SEC schedule in for SEC games Mississippi State is only scored three touchdown\nThree and four games that's not going to get it done against ... they've got to find the ... and they've got to find it quick if they want a chance to win that game\nYeah we're getting to the section of this calendar where the Aggies usually wilted under Kevin ... the steam promises to be tougher under jumbo Fischer will see sixteen drank Texas saying I'm basing Mississippi State that's at seven o'clock tonight on ESPN the wild wild SEC west ... Smith joins has waged the sport's director\nI heart radio in Birmingham weighed two teams that are off this week number one Alabama and number four LSU those teams face off\nNext Saturday in Baton Rouge give us a taste of what you're expecting next week\nI'm expecting the unexpected because everyone in the media every one of the national media especially is looking for every reason possible why LSU could beat Alabama and\nSo to them the unexpected is Alabama just goes out\nAnd lays a beat down and I I really do see it happening this is not me being in the state of Alabama hoping for that that wind to be there I don't think that much of LSU I Know that they're ranked in the top or in the country they've only got one last but when you compare these two teams\nAlabama is the head over heels favored the head over heels better team better quarterback better running back better off into one\nAnd then if you go into the defense that's really the only place for LSU may have an edge but even then if you take out the individual superstars of this thing to make up a team I still take Alabama's talent over el issues in total I don't see an edge\nLSU anywhere on the field outside of potentially the kicking game that would be the only a jealous you had in this thing I don't see a whale is you went to the ballgame and honestly when the line opened up on this thing is going to be double digits for Alabama and you're going to see a lot of people take now they're covered this game in Baton Rouge at night\nAnd then we'll find out on Tuesday around seven o'clock deep first college football playoff rankings including the top ... which of course it is awfully early in the season yet we'll find out who college football playoff comedy things would be in the top or if the playoffs started next week so who's your child or right\nNow I Believe the top four would be Alabama number one and it should be the easiest decision average but out in at number one in the polls they should be the unanimous number one and the coaches NDA people right now but to lone holdout voters and the coaches at Clemson still in there\nRight now I almost get LSU that number to spot I Know I've been the world's worst at LSU and not that good of a team but if you look at what they've done this year even in the skating by and some of the games they've gotten by and they had the best resume of any team in the top and\nI go to her name next and number three in the clubs and number four and that's just because Clinton schedule has been terrible and they haven't looked great and winning all those terrible games\nSo I Would go bam a LSU Notre Dame Clemson but realistically the top nine teams really the top twelve teams are going to filter each other out but the most part they all play each other or they play each other in a conference championship game\nNobody really had a clean road to the playoff or outside of maybe Clemson because they're just nothing left on that schedule and I nothing and the other side of the division the ACC scares me for Clemson I think they're going to walk into this play off it's all a matter of where did they sit in the seating between two to four because I don't the Alabama losing a game either\nWill of Alabama schedule has any meat to it the media are part of the calendar starts next week at LSU weight thank you very much that's are like the wild wild SEC west weight Smith sportswriter for I heard media in Birmingham by the way the four teams out west that are off today we mentioned Bannon LSU also offered as an old miss\nThe rebels get a

[noise] a\nLot of disappointments there um for a lot of reasons the quarterback play at least at first I was just ...\nBut you know a a\nA guy and Jake belly you didn't have a whole lot of help that day either no law to drop passes just a lot of mistakes what have we learned so far about this football team in the first things gave me twenty eight team\nUm if we played at twelve or one o'clock that was ideal for me you know you get up and you\nGo to ... go to the stadium you or do you play but when you've got to sit around all day and watch other teams play or whatever it is you choose to do that um I don't\nKnow ... I guess the is the ADD and me you know coming out you know you want to go to his ... yeah you're you're ready to go but uh certainly uh it gives the fans\nSome time to party down and um they're prepared and get their game on the other and I mean\nWe talked earlier about a meeting a fast start to hide um\n[noise] any answer there for that I I\nKnow we talked about it earlier in the week uh on on Wednesday or you know I had heard so much chance to say a couple of times\nThat he needed to stay away from the team on game day is that he just was to fire up and you know it was a possibility that they got to fired up and that's that is a possibility because he's a he's a fiery all school emotional kind of guy maybe there to a high\nTo fired up when the game begins and it takes a while for them to settle down you know coach burger didn't believe in any of that he didn't believe about a pep talk or getting gas fired up late thought you\nThat on your own and he thought you could get some phony or enthusiasm and three or four minutes later three or four minutes or drives later ... is gone right you don't you're flat so are there are different ways of looking at it I remember we played Clinton and Seventy six up at Death Valley\nThey had had problems starting\nSo red Parker to their coach when they came out on the field for the beginning of the game all their pants white pants address Spain's on them\nAnd it turned out they had scrimmage before they came onto the field I'm really on a on a side bills so that they'd get the a lather up and be ready to go I\nDon't see that every day no you don't you don't know the all feel like they've been just a play or two away from being the game\nTalks these last year's been awhile matter of fact the last six games where these two teams have been decided by six points were less so you don't want to see the same mistakes we saw against texting them two weeks ago you don't want to see a drop past\nOr in an opportunity to get down to scoring position I mean the games actually every point they can get it and I\nKnow and it's absolutely true and you know in many ways Tennessee in South Carolina shorter look good luck I identical to one another you know have played well enough it sometimes to women have looked at the\nFlashes of a really good uh play but in other ways of beating themselves and just have not done what they supposed to do\nYou know and this volunteer team let's face it I mean they're in the rebuilding process certainly but they just ... was it a brutal stretch they played Florida Georgia Auburn whom they beat let's not forget yeah an Alabama\nBut when he was one of those four games so this is a team that comes in that uh you gotta fill it they feel they can beat this game talk football team that I\nKnow absolutely look up a coach proof that I think that's what his name as a Alabama Mm guy yeah saving a protege of solitaire to Greece board up um\nA couple of weeks ago on the sidelines he's instill some discipline in some um fire in a football team and they're playing for him they've quit on Bush Jones you know I felt like they still hadn't you know ... how can you have tendency being poor\nFootball program really you think about the heritage there in the state that they recruit in and all that I mean how can any day now dominate like they did when we first got in the SEC right uh so yeah I think I'm this is a big big game for both of us\nIn a a a a sigh of relief for the ball's in football fans when their quarterback a juror to get her into went down a but is back this week has been in practice the others are just injury\nAgainst the tide but they live a couple of issues the tide in common with Anderson suffered a hamstring injury the first half of that when an Auburn he

C.\nNow here are Christopher ... head of former gay consciousness that Harry will too [noise]\n\nAnd we are here it's always at the circle and BP station on bluff road right across from Williams Bryce our homecoming show as we're broadcasting from our jak from architect of Columbia getting ready for Carolina and Tennessee\nKick off tonight at seven thirty in the SEC Network in time to welcome and Josh Mandel game got beat writer for the state newspaper with the state of the game box and Josh than usual week let's combine to stores because we're just talking about the balls losing their starting tackle you combine that with the fact that the game ... get that DJ one\nHow big do you expect one Im impact to be\nBig I'm now at ... made the comment earlier that this South Carolina defense is more than one player away from being okay but they want to make a big impact on the team that is near the bottom of the SEC and Rushdie fence\nAnd insects is they're leading fat guy last year was six nobody has shown that ac human so far this year and with him out of line up for five of the six games are for the ... they were starting to thirty to forty five and defensive and having trouble\nTrouble setting the edge outside for easily explain raisins he'll help with that so he'll help and it's a kind of guy who unlike most people even though he was injured they took him on road games which speaks to his leadership and what they think about his presence around the team that presence on the field will have an even greater impact I thinking\nHopefully put some other guys at ease\nThat will shape is talk more than once this week about the fact that one was elected as a captain last year so right now that tells you just how much players respect Jim let's talk about the respect for quarterbacks for a moment because it it's interesting both these fan bases have done a little bit of grumbling in the last couple of weeks about\nTheir starting quarterback versus their backup quarterback ... Christ play pretend to see last week so how solid is Jake ... hold on Caroline is starting quarterback position I think\nFrom what I can see what I gather is very solid because we'll most champ is very firmly inject these corner\nSolid enough to withstand another first half like he had against Texas A M I\nIn the ... the ... center\nHe bought it stopped convenience stores don't\nAgree or brought to you by the boy cards on the station with us being got coverage news radio by sixty nobody will be over the\nLine is money to line up against Tennessee once again\nYou're Williams rice the last time\nThese two teams met here it was the first signature when for quarterback Jake Bentley which just won the starting job\nWith a prior reeks game against your ... led the team to what twenty or Twenty one upset of the Eighteenth rank falls but go jerk Wilson turnovers played a key role in that game two years ago against Tennessee Cherlin I got three novels none so as we start to look at this year's Carolina gene\nThere obviously missing turnovers we've talked about turnover margin already this season\nDJ Bronx in the one of the Carolina line backer said that's one of the things we worked on in the last week he says we worked on turnovers or are there any drills is that a mindset is it something you do physically how do you make turnovers\nWell I mean that's something that just staffing this team is focused on for a long time and you you talked about it a lot last year and and we even talk about that before the season started that that was a huge difference in the one last record last year was the short feel that the defense gave to the office so yeah there's drills that you can work on I mean it's a but a lot of it honestly as a mentality and focus\nAll throughout practice so yeah you can work on ... girls and things like that but the big thing is that everything you do you got to be stressing and focusing\nOn turnovers and and going after balls in jeopardy which is something that the officer first to win the running backs about holding it right or when there's a little bit of a gap in the way they're holding the ball is it the defense of mentality so I'm not on the field you know they they close their practices\nBut it's one of those things where you just have got to constantly be hawking on it and hawk and not as coach and if and if you're whether you're in a in a\nPosition drill whether you're in a team Lebanon eleven situation that you gotta constantly constantly beyond them about\nPushing turnovers we'll see if that mentality that dedication which ... says has increased in the last couple of weeks we'll see if that pays off tonight against Tennessee we'll have more on tonight's game across the street a moment first let's check out the big highlight reel brought to us by big boy carts as we look back on that gain Williams rice two weeks\nAgo again that Caroline it ended up we figure out how to shake gone\nStarts and it happened again against twenty second ranked Texas made him a repeat of the way the game played in the first African teams like Kentucky and ms ooh aspiring often at a defense that couldn't get the Aggies off the field fast enough\nLead us Thirteen nothing am lead break and the Aggies will get the ball first start this second\nWhich led to another field goal so it was sixteen nothing aid\nBut in the second half the game kind of started to make things click on ... ... spent like returning after missing the zoo game with a knee injury started just settle in [noise]\nTyler's ours are with the call and the ... network as shy Smith real ... drawing on the board trailing sixteen to sex will ... decided to go for two and it paid off\nAnd it's one that's\nBeen lead a bright eyed works for the good version making gets eight eight and then the game gosh we're not done and the third quarter ... led to another girl and a quarter ended up like ... ... [noise]\n[noise] and that made the score six the fourteen taken him so we'll ... again decided to go for two and the gang ex again calling on number eighty nine\n[noise]\nThe call Curtis you get the SEC Network as the game ... I'd come back we're digging a sixty to nothing oh by\nThe Aggies would not be denied as they started the fourth quarter with a long drive that led to was illegal and the trade the on Williams added a touchdown they can get twenty six to sixteen a late score by DeVos Daniel again got the game got within ... distance but it was too little too late on tactics failed\nYankees at the game got it straight time final score twenty second ranked Texas A M twenty six year old and a twenty three and I have to look back at the game ... last game\nThe big highlight reel brought us by big boy carts All right let's find out what's going on in Jacksonville with that Florida Georgia game and along with all the other top twenty five games in action right now will send you back to gain control here Trump Sanders\nIt's almost like a dog fight down there to Georgia right now the bulldogs lead twenty to fourteen over Georgia about five minutes to go see over Florida about five minutes to go in the third quarter\nIowa in our match up with Penn State Penn State leads twenty four to Seventeen also eighth ranked Oklahoma's winning over Kansas State forty eight to seven and maybe an upset brewing Houston leads USF twenty eight to twenty six about nine minutes to go in the third quarter\nOkay Rob thanks we'll check back in with your shortly let's find out now what's on the mind a former game got quarterback Steve Penny Ellen Steen fans getting a little frustrated with Jake bent Lincoln that aim game a couple of weeks ago is unacceptable for fans to boo a college quarterback or any college player for that matter\nI don't know the acceptable but they pay their money to get in a I think they just need to realize these are student athletes you know you have a right to say what you want but\nI mean they're just youngsters out there doing their best and and that's the thing you gotta remember these kids are trying I mean it's not like that or they're not given everything they got sometimes you just don't\nYou know have your best games and um you know I I don't agree with it but again if you pay your money and you're sitting in the stands as far as sports these days did it ever happened to you as a quarterback oh I Would imagine that through for picks against Clemson in Ninety three\nI Would imagine that I was booed pretty good at it you don't hear it as a as a player is just like everything else huge zone out to all the noise\nWhether it's for you or against you as soon as you take that field they don't hear it and you know maybe going in and out of the locker room at halftime or at the end of the game or if you read about it you know if I was a player these days I I wouldn't be anywhere close to social media\nFormer ... quarterback Steve ... with us or them what is going through the mind of Jake Bentley because we saw two completely different paths first Kathy comes out and we've seen this before from Bentley he's just too hyped up yeah ah\nAnd you would think at some point you know maybe that would kind of go away um specially with the amount of games he's played but uh he definitely play during the second half um had a lot of help the guys I thought you know the big catch down there on the\nLeaf liquor and then the two point play was you know unbelievable stretch and man that was awesome catching stretch but you know you can start at picking the first half especially at a goal line up three points and we had a lot of drops but\nHere's here's the difference you know these other quarterbacks maybe with a little bit better team around them especially on defense or more deaths they can make some mistakes were at a situation where every possession counts and we can't afford to make these mistakes um just because we're we're just not quite there yet\nYou know I think when we're winning a lemon games and we had that those those on defense you know the quarterback could make a mistake or we could turn on the ball over and the defense would come up with a big stop we're just not there yet on defense um specially debts wise and and the game when he didn't stop we couldn't get it\nYou know then that's deaths you know that's that's just and and ... must champs diluted too many times we just not we're not deep enough to overcome those mistakes we can and week out not an FCC Hugo planning another league you know you can overcome some of that but not in this like\nSome of the mistakes that and we've talked about this already this season drops we talked about that a couple of weeks ago you told me you always like to go right back to the receiver after drawn so he knows you've still got confidence in him but have you ever seen it but not only a game but a season where you've got multiple\nTalented receivers who just can't hang on his lip\nAnd and I think that comes because the press and they're trying to make a play and they want to make a play and they're doing everything to make a play they want to create something\nAnd they're just pressing and and you lose concentration for that split second\nAs you're trying to make a play after the catch and you know you drop the ball so I ... I think we're ... we were talented at the receiving Gordon main super town that um but they have had some jobs but again I think that comes down to the to the guys trying to make so many plays after they get the ball on our hands\nLose that split second a concentration and it goes downhill from there and football is a game of momentum\nWhen you see teams that they're just riding a wave of good plays in the years going so good it seems like good things happen when when you struggle it affects everybody and I and I think we're seeing a little bit of that throughout the you know with all the drops and especially the turn of the turnovers are killing us\nFormer ... quarterback Steve ... hill is with us odor of Steve ... group therapy one of the other topics of discussion this week it's been about the game ... slow starts and you mention Jake Bentley in his early struggles with sailing some ass has been in general this team just hasn't been able to function in early\nYou know we always when I was here and [noise] I think as a coach is well we always for the first ten or Fifteen place we might not get to all of them based on what happens but she had a plan either you take a shot you know first or second play the game\nTo kind of get your internal give him a cover to look in and bail at this map of the ball so I think they've got to do a decent job can\nA disguising their coverage is but at the end of the day I think they're going to probably have to play a lot of quarters as well as a lot of cover three which is three deep so they can prevent that the ball and make sure they've got a safety to play over the top\nI don't know if we'll much chance reacting to what if you saw what stern burger the tide in for Texas a and M. said after that game he said we were fairly confident once we lined up to\nThe game pack secondary had no idea where I was and he was making a general point about the fact that the game packs just seemed really confused about covering the tight end in that particular game but it I guess it it\nWent to the larger point that the game pack secondary at times has had trouble talking communicating and yeah may have gotten confused on their coverage is\nWell I think their biggest issue too is there is there issued safety obviously you've got ... out you've got a Nick Harvey out and so you know ... Williams who was a started last year as a freshman but got beat out by Jaycee horn this your corner and now they're rotating him it's safety\nAnd the safety is the position that\nTakes away the tight end right so the corners recovering you're outside guys states usually you guys\nHave to be aware of where the tight end is at all times because most of the route you're gonna run with the tide and our steam routes they're deep crossers are all things with the safety has to deal with and I think that's probably the biggest weakness that we see in the secular right now is the safety position with those two starters out and trying to rely\nOn and both demise Williams who wasn't playing safety now being rotate it over there\nAs well as as young guys being rotate in the position that really don't have any game it's great\nThat it happens to other teams to we saw her out mark way get away for it with a big win against Missouri maybe the the big play that game so tied in can occasionally like get away from a defense particular from a safety and then if your biggest ... you can also get away even if you've got Steven my check on your back\nYeah you can and that's it I think that's one of the other things where if they're playing softer corners whether it's a three D. or whether it's a forty coverage and sometimes those corners could also help uh get involved in the deep passing game if you hit a tight end or something like that they can rally to the ball whereas if you're playing them up on the ball they really can't really and help on anything deep down the middle\nRight as we can says tending to study the game ... match up with the balls tonight in\nA let's find out a little bit more about Tennessee we'll check in with Blake top Myer in our reporters round table it's brought you buy Carolina pool tables plus like of course covers Tennessee football for the Knoxville new sentinel and Blake let's start with\nThe signature when for Tennessee the season and these signature when for Jeremy Pruitt deep Auburn victory certainly jumps out as a highlight how to Tennessee when on the road against are ranked opponents that afternoon\nWhile they were pretty successful hitting a lot of deep shots or a Jared Bernstein who had that game of his career it's a wide receivers\nMade a lot of good plays on on the balls and then they really just kind of made their living on that and the defense was good enough to keep them in the game Auburn was was really successful up in the late early\nUm but as the game progress I thought the defense I kind of got a grasp on an ... system and ah and like I said I mean ... if he played\nSomething close to that level\nYou know week after week you could kind of see\nWhy he was a such a highly touted recruit first plus\nWe'll just guaranteed to have enough help the season we've heard for example that the ... the blind is added struggles this year\nIt certainly has you know it often said wine was probably tendencies biggest issue last year I I Would argue that it's probably still their biggest issue um [noise] and and that's not just in past protection or in the room game they've been pretty underwhelming or creating some holes there too\nI Do think that some of that in and it is hard you know kind of from ... to see at times\nI think some of it comes back together and turn away you know when when uh when Blitzer\nBarrels down on the quarterback and in in a second and a half that looks like bad ... has protection\nSometimes I think it's its own guaranteed ... ah his pre snap breeds he's he's not seeing those those those what's his ... he's not adjusting its past protection to give himself a chance a but certainly there's no question that that are a lot of it does come back to the the office of line he he really\nUm could enjoy some better past protection I I did a breakdown in the snow last week game against Alabama\nGuaranteed ... release was pretty quick you know it wasn't that he was standing back there with the ball three and four seconds ... he was getting ready to the ball on average about two seconds after the snap which is which is pretty good for a college quarterback or it's just that the ... on a few ways he had guys on top of him even even quicker to that\nLike top Myers with is the Tennessee football be writer for the Knoxville news ... lake let's switch gears and talk of the distance for a moment that is of course Jeremy Pruitt's skill what changes as he made since he moved to Knoxville\nWell this is more of a a three forty\nNow than it was last year last year they were were for three and now there are three four but but really\nThey play nickel defense say as much as they play three four so I'm you know much was made of that change in the off season and and certainly it's good off season a dialogue or but really with as much as they claim nickel or you know and it probably was kind of over\nBlown that's probably the biggest noticeable difference that that he's made\nThe defense um you know I Would say it's not made a lot of strides since last year it's\nIt's been okay it was okay last year I I think it's kinda right about the same level of course they lost some some of their better players on the D since last year including where Sean golden uh interest in the NFL with the Carolina Panthers the nickel back but um\nYou know they haven't had a lot of consistent high level performers defensively one week you know one guy on flash and other week it will be someone else but they haven't had someone who's just been kind of dominant through throughout the season I think they could could use it a couple of those guys I'm you know that Daniel bear to lay\nOn their middle line backers which was a had to sit out the first half of last week in Alabama targeting mentally he's probably been there the closest thing to a week in week out um you know consistent performer\nI leads a team in in tackles in it I upfronts Alexis John than a defensive lineman has really come on this year he he's someone that\nIs a junior college transfer\nHadn't played a lot uh before this season and then when he had you know can hadn't done much but this year as a senior he he's really had a had a strong season up her\nWell that leads to a bigger question you will much champ got his signature when in his first season at Carolina against a rank Tennessee team ... had to ... rebuild the roster and return an emphasis here in Columbia on recruiting is that a similar challenge that Pruitt is going through in the transition from butch Jones last few years there\nNo question I mean I I think uh [noise] there are times where I think ... what kind of like the fast forward the clock and have it be twenty Nineteen already you know what I mean he ... he was really frustrated actually Alabama game and um you know pretty critical\nOf his team's performance and and basically said you know these guys can't get the job done I'm going to find people that are\nThat can only recruiting tree on and will replace him\nAnd and that is all well and good unit you need to recruit good players I ... that that has to happen for this program to get elevated the fact is um you know Tennessee's sitting there were three wins a bowl game is still a possibility this year I'm you know for for these remaining five games you can find a way to win with these guys\nUm and then supplement this this program which recruiting it was always interesting during the the Jones are it wasn't that they they weren't getting highly ranked recruiting classes\nUm they were you know it's it's the always ranked pretty well and recruiting\nIt's just sometimes those as highly rated recruits didn't quite live up to that recruiting hype and and so a ... task will be not only you know getting those high rank rank guys but then getting something out of them that that reflects a you know what they what they were rated in in the recruiting process\nLike top Myers with us he covers Tennessee football for the Knoxville new sentinel like this series between ... and the game Cox has been so close recently what is the Tennessee mindset the fans and players for that matter going into the night's game\nWell I think another close game is expected you know I mean you you mentioned how close it's been I think it's six years in a row now that it's been decided by\nSix points are less than and or the other thing I think about it is and and our our columnist John Adams kinda wrote this um earlier this week made the argument that in a way it feels like the SEC east\nIsn't big enough for for both Tennessee and South Carolina to be successful and I I kind of agree with that you know uh you look at the east and historically Georgia Florida pretty good year after year obviously there's there's been a year to\nYear were Florida's been down but overall I think you can expect those programs to be pretty good and there's still room I think for for another program to be to be functioning a high high level they're nice um\nBut the idea that you could have Georgia Florida Tennessee south\nCarolina you know all at that level someone's got to be losing games you can have with [laughter] you know all those burgers at the top of these and so I Do think that you know\nFor the here now in kind of going forward you know it is interesting will be interesting to see which of these programs I'm kinda rises up to the to the top and and so I I think South Carolina is a pretty good litmus test for Tennessee right now I'm you know ... ...\nIf quick screens if tunnel screens you know which is the screen from the outside in if you're doing a lot of those quick perimeter throws in releasing Lima now\nYou can get the ball the receivers a lot more that's one way that you could incorporate debo into the ... the passing game a lot more because he's outside on one side ... outside on the other side all you gotta do is look and see which way they rotate in the defense of coverage and throw it to the other one that's another thing that you can do\nIn terms of a check so you instead of doing an Arpaio with a a down field passed you could Arpaio around in a screen if they've got too many guys in the box you throw the quickest great if they've got\nKnow one guy out of the box you run the ball and that doesn't put you in a situation where you're pushing the down feel ball by if they're both high percentage conversion makes\nA lotta sense will cease again can take advantage of that we've been promised\nThe ... for South Carolina primary limited both said there will be\nEight and increased dedication to the game is air just pointed out they did that after the half but those adjustments coming too little too late two weeks ago\nYeah I think they've gotta they've gotta know going in like you said this tendency team has been really start ... slow getting out of the gate to their one of those teams that haven't done much in the first half we can't give them a situation where all of a sudden they feel good about things halfway through the first quarter South Carolina got to take advantage of this and get going early\nNow we've been dying to find out what's going on in Jacksonville, Florida Georgia locked up and in a pretty tight battle up until a certain point Rob Sanders back in ... got control is that still a type ...\nIt is as of right now of course number seven Georgia and number nine Florida down in Jacksonville they are about midway through the fourth quarter now twenty three to Seventeen Georgia leads the way\nOther games include number Seventeen Penn State up by ten over Iowa twenty seven to Seventeen and Oklahoma is blowing out Kansas State fifty wonder fourteen about seven minutes to go in the fourth quarter\nIran thank you very much and looks like Georgia has the football right now as well so they can increase their lead\nOr they're down to the Florida twenty four yard line time now for our crystal pools game caught player profile brought to you by crystal pools he is a leader off the field but unfortunately for the game ... that's where a DJ want him has been\nFor the last five games won them injured his ankle

game packs now with both sides of their ... and Alan Williams can line up on one side DJ want him in the other and certainly that's a whole lot for Jared guaranteed on on the tendency often staff to handle\nYeah no question it's definitely hard you'd last thing you want to do is lose one of your best players\nLeft tackle but then to lose your best player while the other teams get one of their best players back South Carolina got to take advantage of that create some havoc in the backfield but here in Toronto in his back and at least a hurry I mean hopefully cause a couple of turnovers to put him in a situation where he's not so comfortable in the pocket\nDouble whammy for Tennessee no doubt about it and just two minutes we'll hear from game got great Jeff grants when we return with
