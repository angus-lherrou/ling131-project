his office had up to a month to present a case to a federal grand jury well that result came much faster as shooter Robert Bowers was indicted today on forty four total counts which include federal hate crimes\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel\nAnd yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and

he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in anti Semitic following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel thinking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull lease on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not it's in it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the

they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm

than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that may actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic gripe frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over one of the things stay home and then they feel about run out one voted do you have to have ended up not having voted by election day do you not do anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because let's go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or where the with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy\nNot functionally ah I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about ... form which would mean policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up is speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I hadn't either when I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nKenny one who does not bode hands effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves\nIf you don't want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you then again she was smart lady because she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services um she go down to less than you think to yourself\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like to know why should cetera on that kind of a not voting is in effect a handful vote for Nancy closer to be the best we can [noise] um and I think that's\nGood yeah I have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for reticent in Tennessee you're\nYou're voting for sure and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat hands for the poor for a leader can say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house all of course and went on from that closely but you know I sort of have to do that fine\nTo treat them there are a liberal if they say the oh I'm really kind of a moderate Democrats you know I got to vote for ... defeat them who's sitting here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence that this is a team sport 'cause the radical end of the Democratic party's in control of their party that their leadership or his his orderly and acceptable and that I think we have an obligation to a\nHuman to feed them and the way to treat them as to make sure you've heard\nUm listen I got to tell you that's the main thing let me play for use some of the more recent comedy played Joe Scarborough and Don Lemon and Alison ... and this is what is representative of the news media today\nI'm well thanks a lot of friends\n[laughter] yeah well you know I got a timed it out better if I was a professional manner\nYou dumped five minutes of insanity and go and when we get back and try to make sense of this\nWhen we get back to try to make sense of that that's all coming up straight ahead and we'll get out of your calls in on the other side are as we continue with Sean Hannity show\n\nHandle the truth\nSo wholesome thing real\nW.

births when so are there is no provision was talking to them and then\nOnce you're handing away Rick orange people who are born outside the jurisdiction of the law to be considered ... and she's very unclear debate showing it in the Congress took the time when it's clearly if you remove the constitutional number nine to very clear and what it means uh I\nPersonally think the question is far better off to moved ... challenge and Congress\nTo repeal it rather than do just as the presidential jak if you order because there was an executive order\nThe next president he could reverse it but if you turned it into a law there'll be a pretty hard law is going to change and once they got adopted and it's not helping the debate for us to have is a country because it comes back to exactly the same challenges the care of it are we as a nation\nAre we allowed to define who is with American are we in a position where we can say to people who are not American you have to meet some test oh to be considered a ... to be eligible to serve\nAs a citizen and I'm saying these are very fundamental questions about the very nature of our society\nThe demo with a political party that wants to destroy

America's gonna make a choice there is now a movement that has evolved Mr Speaker out about it argue from moderate Democrats are extinct it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nLegislature vision of two totally different Americans you know there there are America's one in which we don't teach American history we don't want him to be American and will not proud of the white motion so you could count on a motion to leave the star Spangled Banner\nUh and uh you know we're just one more normal country though to be subordinate to the un and of course\nNo wonder because we're the wealthiest country in the world we're already seeing huge amounts of money to coax a because they'd like to be wealthy challenged the tiny chance that\nThey don't have the money isn't it like you have managed amazing to watch and serious um these folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of variety unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if

heading north from Central America to scare voters ahead of next week's elections\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that capital back history of California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when\nOrange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think California races being that important\nBut now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in in which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls can or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this was a real threat and I think\nReal possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups are\nAre Republicans on defense means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can money ... ... exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\nYou know it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that um the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\n[noise] it's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAh and the Democrats have thirty nine and sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of a union you no longer have to pay your dues that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point or in the future in the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats than in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nOr and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hold the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo

other side of that border and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and and\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on the health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that my husband had gotten kicked off my plan\nAnd um I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's has that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and uh yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up yet again\nAnd less coverage getting dang for tests and things that used to be covered and I'm just I Want everybody to get out there and vote because we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody those now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care we're going to vote no I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the\nIt gets lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nAre but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in

about it next\nJonathan there is a headline in the state newspaper about how Lindsey Graham wants to support Donald Trump and and the birthright citizenship and in the story in the state newspaper they actually miss quote the fourteenth amendment so I'll read to you what the state wrote all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens of the United states\nAnd of the state we're in a reside period that is not the fourteenth amendment I Hope some people will do Google check I Will read it to you the way it is written\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of oh what's that line yes that one line that makes the world of difference subject to the jurisdiction there of meaning that the parent has to be subject to the United states in other words they can't have another citizenship\nSomewhere else they have to be well I guess you could have dual citizenship but somebody's got to be a parent of the United states and just to prove this point a little bit further Jonathan\nI'll point out a story that I read from the guardian in August of twenty Fifteen but says every Republican Congress since Nineteen Ninety One has introduced legislation to undo birthright citizenship that is not what we're trying to do what we're trying to do is enforce the law\nThe two full frustration is is that they needed executive

oh California it's its neighbor and Oregon its neighbor\nAnyway he was a certified governor elect twice in two thousand and four than a King County literally discovered brand new balance that broke overwhelmingly for the Democrat and they counted up despite the fact that it was clear in that case\nAt least my reading of it that some felons ineligible people that actually voted and King County has a lecture and control systems have been sloppy but you had you know groups like ... von and others you know paying for a recount of the ballots and they found another new votes\nThat were not counted to\nA well not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and that is that what the ... hundred and twenty nine votes are the two million eight million vote\nSlow down there how did you have more votes than voters and there'd be counted\nThat we questioned as well and the\nThe Democratic on a judge Shira ... decided that we were gonna have to have the votes are actually care\nWell why wouldn't you just use a little calculators they have this number of voters and the number of votes

in this case 'cause it's an extraordinarily important time in our history\n\nAnd I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them\nMany like Don Lemon is CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and now I've gone through and look these are firing offenses but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this\nWant a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can ah they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again a birthright\nCitizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my carry out is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue that Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or what have been done already they said the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass the statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the left says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're known as the things\nThat birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nEffects the case then house a statute gonna fix statue won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way that a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps there\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship\nWas not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies that Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nEither bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and no statute was passed so why do we feel ... and the constitution or pass this statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabinet was so crucial\n\nHe's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happen to be wrong he knows more than they do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there and the conservative review today left this concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship with a left\nCherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq walk collectively ignoring enlist uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite all\nFor the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F wells and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no no principle on quote quote it is not the object to this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those what'd you belong to every citizen unquote that's what he declared in Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it\nHow many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it wouldn't be applied to illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not one\n\nThat's a madman was passed to protect African American former slaves not foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nThe notion that an amendment designed a grand freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens would be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\nThe first sentence\nOn the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not only allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafter is added a second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nI\nChallenge all those who have a different view from me\nIn academia\nOr practicing lawyers are former federal this form of that I challenge you\nTo show me the evidence in the Eighteen\nSixties that support your position\nTheir birthright citizenship wasn't trying to the fourteenth amendment just give us one piece of evidence I challenge you\nTo show me any statutory authority where Congress intended and in fact affirmatively granted birthright citizenship\nTo the children of illegal aliens and I challenge you to explain\nIn some kind of coherent way how something that is done by the federal bureaucracy cannot be on done by the president directing the federal bureaucracy which is what an executive order is\nNow if you're telling me he'd have a stronger case if it was a statute is not going to get a statute and I don't understand why that's a stronger case if it's your position that at some shrine in the constitution that nothing can change it by the constitutional amendment which will never happen [noise] I'll be back with me here\nData is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and
