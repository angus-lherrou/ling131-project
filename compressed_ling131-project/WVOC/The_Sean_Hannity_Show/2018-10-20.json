you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want\nLive when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet anyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday I had a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe into show gaze disappearing that is the the\nSaudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia Middle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying\nThat there were no attempt to interrogate cause show he but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him the source told the site that his death took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe to show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air do on and the Turkish foreign minister\n...\nRubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation might bump pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts the day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants\nAll the facts top us deployment diplomat Wednesday\nRefusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged ... team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman Solomon\nAccording to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... ... was murdered by Saudi operatives ... the president say they didn't get any tape but this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that can show that he could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saudi counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's\nGoing on and we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should\nRush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr\nSebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies\nAlso Dan hop but Fox News contributor thirty or CIA op operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is dead whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't on American soil that trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab arms dealer of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil rooted brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of living that day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the consulate\nUm we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly December ... a a show he thought he after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concern to us we'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they\nNeeded to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm paying with needing and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box\nAssuming that I Believe\nThat the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying\nIt I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there are very different country but now it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe\nConsequences the president said but it gets a little rough or what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like on a fixture self domestically it is the author of the possible must be a over the perfect on on the truth fish or we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B as to vomit been found them in

there was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that why is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to\nUse is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she what she means to do that's come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president for not running for president I Am not running for president at the United states are you going to find that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\nI'm Geoff Diehl running to be a full time US Senator you don't need a part-time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm just deal guy just automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren ... officers racist from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts\nI'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed\nFor ever that she is Native American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\nWhile teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that isn't titled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nAnd tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want to let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also a different point select the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist French at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about the safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House when you're twenty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Columbia", "day": "20"}
