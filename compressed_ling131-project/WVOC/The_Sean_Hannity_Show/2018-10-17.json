wise well if you don't say that you're going to have a tear up against them they're never going to negotiate\nAnd the fear of the tariff has caused them all to negotiate that means more jobs at home look at you know look at the the the new deal with a Canada Mexico\nThat helps American workers in Ohio in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania you know bringing back manufacturing look what it's

mostly of our Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is\nIf you don't threaten to pull out of a deal and you don't threaten terrorists you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous or secure I don't care but I Want I Want this country to be prosperous\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is reporting\nOn the twenty fifth of July\nThe declaration of a ceasefire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to get pressure on China from Europe he's affective Lee and people are really reporting this priest joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues\nAnd he's treated ... grievances with China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... owned by me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me right now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nDon't question yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs that you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it out shortly thereafter\nOr because we both know the president's personalities hitting very very or\nA but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness with the Chinese government are and what is best for the American working family so\nAh and that's why he's doing so well ... and by the way you know I was ... doing a lot of traveling around the country I was in Detroit last night I spoke

James O'Keefe\nYou know you are hated by people because of what you're doing it there I'm ... I mean I talk to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor discussed and I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most\nHating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them as the United States Senate or had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri or their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed as something that I've been pointing out for a while we Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that literate that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially\nHas to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us to take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under\nThe law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute the cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then went all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchists middle class of benders attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist trying to stop him from taking her campaign side\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play loaded on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley that's her opponent would be part of fraudulently embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she is one on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will go by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own their own their own or it's not\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for him for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach trumpet you can tell the moderates to get over it after\nShe gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting to expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's\nProbably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next\nTo release a candidate a bit of the time we have to United States senators and their candidates\n[noise]\nIn the w._b. as the new center I'm Elise as he was

E. T. V. it's seven PM but\nHere's the question Jonathan with McMaster up in the most recent polls by roughly twenty two twenty three percent why would he take this challenge given James Smith an opportunity to stand before the people of South Carolina not once but twice got two debates coming up\nAnd not only with James have an opportunity like he's never had before to spread his message what happens in my master mix among step would it be missteps them an answer that's what it's all about James Smith can say whatever he wants and he's not going to win it really doesn't matter because he's a Democrat what matters is Henry McMaster if he screws this up and it becomes a TV campaign\nYou got a big problem I Would not be in this debate I mean it's a foregone conclusion brother this'll be like the game called scheduling to clubs and twice the season [laughter] when I think about it how bad can it actually be if again forty percent of the south Carolinians hadn't even heard of the nuclear debacle [laughter]\nMcMaster doing worse than that you will find out why it's tonight it's seven of us know what you think on Twitter at rush thought\n\nAlec Baldwin's favorite radio talk show host is on the air right now right Mr mall when [laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nThere was a twenty four teams studying scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that why is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she what she means to do that's come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president for not running for president I Am not running for president at the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy just on automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call a lease officers racist from front to back\nMe I call them heroes\nMy campaign isn't about forty pounds about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts\nI'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage or that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of America law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania all teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nPow wow chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics at the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nAre the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really ... somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up are you doing\nIs showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm AOL dot run one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model worthy on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist ... she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about the safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House when you're twenty\nI'm no folks uh Massachusetts whatsoever\nStudy for people to you know change jobs change careers get more money get better benefits have a greater career trajectory and their life\nSo they can maybe get a little bit better house a nicer car or truck that can take the vacation go out to eat you know every other week whatever they want to do not have to worry about where the money's coming from save for retirement\nYou know get something really cool for the kids the grandkids that's all it takes money you know I've been without money and then I have money and believe me it's a little easier when you're habit and anybody that tells you any different is full of crap also nice I get to give some away too I like doing\nWhat are you laughing at me why did why why did I get that I never laugh at you and laugh\nWith you that you just lied cause you absolutely laugh at me a lot and never laugh at you only with you there right now he's a partnership but to a team sport that's like saying that treat is going to make it then you know darn well treat wouldn't have made it and it may get yeah because they you know well that use ... shock treatment that's how they got her to obey\nThere's something wrong with you yeah there is a hey the FBI is warning anyone that gets paid through direct deposit which is most of us now\nBe on the lookout for these phishing emails requesting any personal information logging credentials your bank account look those credentials they'll steal them that'll be used to change all bank account information it'll block any alert that you would otherwise get\nWarning of changes to your direct deposit that has redirected to another account controlled by the identity thieves\nSo many threats in today's connected world\nAnd all it takes is just one weak link for criminals to get in\nAnd thank goodness that is the all new life lock identity theft protection with the added power a boost up north in security and they help protect you against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see your fix on your own protect your good name your reputation your bank account your retirement accounts don't have people taking out credit card loans and your name\nIs gonna light lock dot com or call one eight hundred life lock mentioned by name Hannity you get an extra ten percent off your first year and for a limited time uh twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment as light lock dot com one eight hundred life luck but break right back into\nTime ...

Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero sales nada didn't happen as possible\nBut it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if NBS is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who\nThinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is they pitched enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's\nOur enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gig and stupidly they decide to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nMid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about Jamal ... who was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith the girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going towards\nDirection and his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what this is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen in the house I have no idea so so let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does\nEight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three

I wanted to ask since when did the last start you want us to battle and other countries' businesses I mean this guy a horrible what happened but he's a Saudi Arabian citizen it happened and Saudi Arabia or at the sea and turkey\nAnd last last time I checked they spent a decade saying oh why are we involved in Iraq why it out with all of with all the war crimes with with Iraq and and uh Saddam Hussein\nAnd now they want us to start meddling it just because they think they can tide Trump to it I mean it's just crazy to me\nWell what can we what should be the reaction I guess October the second or ... was killed in a horrible way\nBut in America there are cops killed there's American citizens murder by legal aliens there's horrible domestic violence happening that those crimes happening tonight somewhere terrible not\nSolved why does CNN want to use that crime eight thousand miles away as a cudgel against Trump what's the reason\n[noise] I mean personally I think it's because it's a horrible story and be\nA Trump is looming on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw them but I personally don't think it's going to work um but it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and and time off to says she goes I\nPut this thing what is there about this thing work his show gay I guess it wrote some comes the Washington Post he had a green card but it is a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess a Saudi Arabian territory\nAnd yet and yet what ah it's it's what I mean oh so interesting\n... when a when re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car\nPolice officers in New York City that was like a one day story nationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media\nCan you imagine if some Trump wearing ... Ga had\nHad hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nOh would have been the top story for a week and I think you bring up a good point\nWho do you think the left is wanting to defend quick or a journalist that one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are mad about that don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own and works at the Washington Post rather than some of our of our um police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean why why do we spend I mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it I imagine right now it's the biggest story on CNN MSNBC holidays is about ... ... what to Jared Kushner knew\nWho knew NBS better was a ... or was it ... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder I re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers and one B. L. M. got what they want it what are we went dead cops when he won them now and re most in lieu were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered\nIn a barge sound Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it and at this point\nWhat is in the media spend time instead of the show geek in Turkey\nTake up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform and spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most who was killed according to this black nationalist\nHe said that he wanted to come and killed police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not to Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there\nWas a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers roared fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an armed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson and grab is gone inside the police car and that was proven that was proven\nBut the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ... New York city and murder them why didn't CNN cover that aspect to the story\nAnd the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly met with representatives of black lives matter that advocates murder of cops who were killed in Dallas in Baton Rouge what in CNN cover it that way\n[noise] [noise] because it doesn't fit their narrative 'em and they are back and think about that it doesn't ...\nIt doesn't in other words they can't use that as a weapon against a either John Banner or George Bush Ronald Reagan or now it's now it's Donald Trump see the media ought to call balls and strikes but instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda\nThen they go after the obscure fact\nI'm some saw being killed in Turkey which they can use as a club against Jared Kushner because Assad's him invested in real estate ventures of Trump years ago and they spend money at the hotel next to the White House so they keep looking for reasons the tide Trump to the murder and it's sickened me Josh thank\nYou for your call let's continue with more we have a chemist joined a JD in Tom are a couple of days ago I met with the president and ah he gave me some coaching thought someone to share with you and about Fifteen minutes they'll counting and the great American in for mark Levin much\nCan you smell when I'm cooking [noise] still counting on the great American and for the great one mark\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress I take it over every mattress I ever had it helps me get the best night's sleep period and once you try Caspar you're going to love yours to\nCasper as a high quality mattress and an affordable price and I sleep calling comfortably every night thanks to the unique combination of phones that provide the right pressure relief and alignment in Casper\nShips right to your door for free and they small how'd they do that size box believing pick it up if you don't love it and refunds you everything premise engineering towards packaging it's no wonder Casper has over\nThirty five thousand five star reviews of all their products across Casper Google and Amazon put Casper it to the test in your own home\nFor one hundred nights risk free go to Casper dot com and use code mark for fifty dollars towards the purchase of select mattresses that's Casper dot com code mark\nFor fifty dollars towards the purchase of select mattresses\nCasper dot com terms and conditions applied\nHigh scary David went in and I decided to upgrade our countertops we look for a company with a great selection great prices\nAnd one of the prides itself on insulation in customer service we felt all that and more with lifetime cabinets and counter tops I can tell you this if you can't find exactly what you're looking for a while you're there and that's rare they'll find it for you\nThey cut and install you're kind of tops it'll bomb it out to a third party contractor they do it all was runs on the front of the in the run and Colombia and treatment when in shape and granted marble courts courtside they've got it all seem on Facebook had lifetime cabins and counter tops or call seven seven to twenty to twenty\nHello this is Keith Karimov with shaping furniture Jennifer let's play a word association game I say a word and you tell me the first thing that comes to your mind really it'll be fine you're ready first word Columbus\nDay pumpkin pie five to ... ... yeah\nWow those were my same answers and here's the amazing thing right now at shaping furniture they all go together three Saturday October twentieth as part of our Columbus Day sale you'll say big on Basset custom furniture orders up to thirty percent off hand crafted furniture made to order\nNeed a new mattress no problem ... parts are on sale too but what about the pumpkin spiced latte well\nSpring mind to me at the store each day hey you won't have to eat it was ...

President before we get too deep into there's no money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and there was quite something special but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible the level of poverty\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just such on the human race as they need it\nAnd she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been created and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than it used to what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out I don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good\nBut we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking about are we talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\n... you're talking about millions of jobs for judge don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nThey make a big deal if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge\nSo essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed just to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can sell into their into into their countries they have tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians\nAnd we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a\nA piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the plan and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the as we", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Columbia",
