point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nThe differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working um the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin out his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nLook at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America that between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it counts so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nHey Sean Hannity here one of the best things I ever did in my life was by two huge liberty safes and I love the peace of mind that the

Sally war hero against this radical Christian seminars now no problems with Americans joining\n... and and joining the Taliban and then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits a and Joe Donnelly is case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big

people before the election that those lives for the the bulk of information to secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lied and committed a fraud before the court and then

when he he said well those are just college kids volunteers and we find out no that's his full time staff\nAre I'm sure that uh he was embarrassed again\nI'm certain that they should have been embarrassed whether or not but of course you know and then they start saying\nWell if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not just as a project maritime project they started saying well all these other excuses but the ... they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he got to be a

of the candidates strategies now that we'll talk about next well\nDoes and we've been told that a candidate James Smith is focusing a lot of his money and time in the upstate or South Carolina as you know that is the most conservative part of the state of South Carolina and that's an odd move for a Democrat to focus most of their time over there\nEven for a politician because they say play to your strength and anything alive right so you need to build up the base even more in the middle Ensign yes you have a good base in the lower part of the state but that's the bedrock of conservatism up above Greenville\nThe only thing we can think of is the fact that McMaster polls very poorly with conservatives and so that was true going into the primary and McMaster eventually did win the primary by five points over John Warren but got creamed in the upstate\nSo is the betting on the Republicans that are really hard those are going to sit it out or they go actually go from McMaster over to

I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nCoverage was different the coverage of what happened\nSusan Collins was different wasn't administered the dos and there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president who was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's\nFully open it's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first to the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the president does than any politician does\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute maybe I just spent an hour talking about it you can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we\nHave thousands of radio stations

president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\nNow\nWhy does all this matter it matters\nBecause of the media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque good\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now\nI Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL as the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear make but you're also going to hear a never Trump or probably denies he's never Trump or John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do her CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann Hi Adam in hiding them in any way a\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called network cut five go\nBut I Do now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that\nLate it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the lady I was he targeted this is an unusual for the ... go ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame him for the president's rhetoric ... stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense pot or it's\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay moron in some sense it's okay you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary read much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner you go ahead\nOh I think causes I think when you have a rhetoric of a kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nIt has a price on that his call the media the enemy of civil and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and the federal judge was murdered I remember that it was in ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media and then you\nWill cost the enemy of the people of course we're not you know what I mean the people what what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever is all part of it and is being treated as an enemy is\nGoing to act like [laughter] see me so I don't know where she will be complicit\nIn ... so\nHe is complicit let follow his lead a disgraceful for

your riled up maybe or moved to work harder to defeat your political opponents but people do not leave a political rally saying to themselves what he said about those bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to anti it's a sign of the times a reflection of the course of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners that go with it\nThere's more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as fighting words that has given been given minimal constitutional protection because apparently insults and insights\nLet's see but I Do not mean to suggest that it is inconceivable that any but the most powerful ball incitement could ever be actionable\nIn politicians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically accountable regardless whether the circumstances allow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing spray because of something\nHeard at a political rally no normal
