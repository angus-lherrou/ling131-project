five grand back has been interested in\nIs not a climbed investment advisor service is ... ...\nWe are back thanks for joining us\nToday they stayed here retirement with pets through the generally jak here alongside pat he's the founder of preservation specialists you've seen pat and the local media you've read his articles in USA Today and investors business daily\nHe joined me today as we talk about whether you're getting good advice for going through this checklist to help you determine if you are getting good financial guidance this is so important\nAs you head into retirement one of the things you want to know is is the advice giver you're working with is required to put your best interests ahead of their own self pat should we ask more from our financial professional van upholding the fiduciary standard\nYes ah in fact I heard a speaker say many many moons ago Gen if someone is giving you bad advice there's only two possible answers is because they don't know the right answer it where they don't care and he would always say well which one is better and the point being neither one's acceptable right [laughter]\nSo you need someone who cares which is the fiduciary standard because they're putting your interests first but then you also need somebody who knows it's my second item on the checklist is you need to determine if the financial professional who's providing you with advice has the skill set in the know how to help guide you financially in the current phase of life you're in right now\nAnd if you're not retired yet into retirement and this is a topic that I Know we've discussed a little bit in the past I Would say early in my career Jen I I really wouldn't have realized how powerful and how important this was but this is something that I have conversations with clients about on a daily basis and it's not me bringing it up its people kind of saying\nThis is what's on their mind and the analogy I always use is\nThe overly simplistic one in our industry says there's two phases of your financial life there's accumulating while you're working and then there's\nTaking income in preserving when you're retired and I always say you know think of that accumulation phase just it you know if you think of like a horse a racehorse or they put blinders on them that's the best thing to think of\nIf you're listening to this and you're far from retirement and you're just trying to figure out how to put money or four one K. or whatever just set it up with your employer put blinders on and then just don't even pay attention to just work and say work and say\nThat's the key but it's you can't do that until the day you retire like that doesn't work so there needs to be a third phase and that's the transition phase\nAnd this is what we're talking about is do you have someone to help guide you through and this is where I get lots and lots of questions everyday jak which is when do I started that transition is it based on how old I Am how far from retirement how much I've saving accumulated\nA of course it's a mix of all those things and so this was that transition time that we think is incredibly powerful to help you make sure you're getting good advice to lead you into that retirement stage\nWell pat what skills inexperience should we look for in the person who's going to help us with this transition phase for retirement\nI think there's a number of them that come to mind for me Gen ... what kind of walk through a few of those here uh one would be\nMost people when we're thinking of retirement planning the first thing that comes to their mind as their nest egg of their investments most people don't have the benefit of being able to just retire up say Social Security or social screen of pensions so they're living off of a four one K. or some type of nesting so that's where the again if you're a twenty five and putting your first dollar and you're four one K.\nWe always double check out to make sure right because sometimes things go according to plan and sometimes there's a big surprise Social Security is a great example that I've told you Jan that I've learned over the years that until we run the numbers\nI won't have any idea what the recommendations would be or advisory team just earlier this week and we were going to get an Alice this and it just said something that none of us expected it\nYou know we're kind of numbers in financial geeks we'll look and say oh wow that's really interesting you know I haven't seen that before but it's fun 'cause we're we're trying to do is obviously pull together the\nBest thing for that particular person and then once you gather that information is about designing implementing a strategy that connect your goals one that's flexible enough to accommodate the adjustments are going to happen later in life and I've got a kind of phrase I like to use gym that I think summarizes his entire topic and what's really really important if your\nTo anyone whether it's in a casual conversation or sitting down with a financial professional just keep in mind are you hearing about product before plan\nThat is the one thing you need to be very cautious of because if you come in and say hey I'm retiring next year and they said oh man I got this great annuity it's going to be perfect for you well that's a big big time out that you want to put their okay because they don't know anything about you and they are assuming that they have one thing that's the best thing for everybody\nAnd so what you really need to do is watch for that and see if they're looking at your plan overall or if they've got kind of this one thing that they think is the best thing for everybody in so we always want to be careful of product before plan and you want to always have planned first\nSo that sounds like it's one red flag someone who's really pushing the sale of a particular thing rather than pushing the process first any other red flags we need to be looking out for when trying to find the right advice giver\nYeah it's you know a few that come to mind Gen we were talking earlier about being a fiduciary and Syria of course doesn't mean that that plan or isn't being compensated dumb way one of the things they would do is certainly be open about that so you just want to have transparency so you can have an honest conversation\nAnd understand what type of fees are paying and how everyone is being compensated we like to talk about\nThe various ways that we can be compensated in not only that but if we're helping manage any part of the nest egg how those investment companies being compensated because those are I think both extremely important and valuable for you know\nAnother one that's kind of a just a a broad generalization I Would say is just be careful of big promises\nIf someone's telling you that can make you a huge return with no risk you know I think we all have the the idea of you know it'd be too good to be true if something sounds too good to be true you always want to ask questions and understand that I always say there's no perfect investment there's no perfect plan\nThere's pros and cons to everything and as a fiduciary what we're doing is you're planners were just trying to help you see both of those\nAnd then one other one that I thought of that I think is really important is\nYou want to before you hire somebody just whenever an idea what type of time is going to be available that you can expect the term that we always want to say to watch out for is what we call the quote unquote the hand off which is you know if there's an advisor who maybe owns the company or the leaves advisor\nAnd kind of walk you through the first meeting or the first two meetings and then you're handed off to you know a college in turn or something like that up for future means because they're off meeting new people\nAnd uh you know every advisory firm has their own process and we all have a limited number of hours you know and as you know I've got a wife and a three year old a two year old so I Can't work eighty hours a week\nThe boss of the house was not happy with that and I wouldn't be there right so we only to find a balance\nAnd said well we talk about with new clients is if there's financial planning questions if there's investment advice that we're discussing that's going to be with your advisor if there are things that can be done like changing how much money you're taking on a monthly basis or change your beneficiary we have team members\nThat actually are better at that than the advisers are anyway so it's kind of we have found a way to leverage that is to really have a great team\nTo help you kind of handle everything that you need to handle and really all this comes back to his that transparency of just understanding what you're getting yourself into and making sure that you're not having a misunderstanding with someone right from the beginning and again that's another thing that we always talk about the reason we offer\nThe meeting it absolutely no cost a new obligation to review your circumstances is to give you an opportunity to talk with a comprehensive retirement plan or to help get kind of meet them and get to know their personality and see if there's a fit there so to get started with that type of new costs new obligation review costs now at age ... three nine retire\nAnd there are a lot of things that we've tried to look at when we try and put together that retirement review for you but we want to take a look at a review of where you stand in how close you already are goals\nWe want to look at how much risk you're taking more stress test your nest egg as you're transitioning getting closer to retirement and do you have an income plans set up if not we'll give you an idea what that would look like\nOnce again that number's eight oh three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call right now and mentioned the savior retirement radio show to get started that number once again as a two or three nine\nRetire pets to be is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak alongside eight oh three nine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three is the number we have been going through this\nChecklist of items we need to be clear about to help determine if we're getting the right financial advice\nFor our transition into retirement\nPat what's another thing for us to think about what's another item on your check list\nThe next one I Would mention is are you following the formal written strategy for retirement one that has a lot of thought put into it research understanding it's personalized to you and then also\nHaving the flexibility to adjust to changing or unforeseen circumstances and what I'm Talking about here is a real documents that actually has stepped in strategies in there something that you can pull off the shelf or pull up on your computer screen and this is kind of designed to be the compass right we know what your goals are\nAnd this is kind of helping make sure that you stay on that path and you know I've had this happen Jen where you know maybe if someone comes in starts working with us in their mid fifties one part of that plan is kind of health care and insurance planning and that may be very low on their priority list when we get started\nWell maybe a few years later maybe they have a parent or\nAnother family member that needs nursing care and suddenly that's on your mind and so you've got this peace of mind to know hey we've talked about that and we've got a plan in place that fits your circumstances and so that can be very helpful and then the other piece that I mentioned briefly there is we all know life changes so we have goals right now\nThey may be exactly the same as they were five or ten years ago where they might be ... miles and miles away and totally different so\nHandling those curve balls that happened I was just meeting with a longtime client and he went in for a routine checkup a few months ago and they referred to a specialist and he ended up having to have open heart surgery and while that was a scary time for them we were actually meeting just a few days ago and they said you know thank God\nI we went in there because I might not be sitting here right now if we hadn't done that so there's big curve balls there that's affected their lifestyle it's affected you know medical expenses and things like that so making sure that we have a plan that has that ability to adjust to of course is another valuable piece\nAnd having an actual written formal strategy is going to make a difference rather than just thinking about some of these things and having an idea of what you're going to do\nYou know I think for a few reasons Gen as we've seen this over the years one is life serves curve balls at you and that can be personal family changes that can be the economy or the stock market\nYou know if the markets crash or you have major medical problems we all left her own devices we might panic reading and so by having a plan and a planner in place gives you someone to talk through that and make sure that you stay on track\nThe other thing that I found Jen is they're usually a couple of areas of the plan that are really important to someone when we're sitting down talking at that time and then there's often a couple of areas that are kind of on the back burner\nBut what people have told me is just knowing that they have someone else looking at that with them and they have something written a document it just gives them peace of mind so I think there's those kind of in measurable benefits but then you also have you know the specifics when you have an income strategy\nWe believe wholeheartedly that you can usually squeeze more income out of your different sources by making the most of them by having a plan for how you're taking that income\nFor many people were able to help them pay less taxes and retirement because we're helping\nKeep them in a lower tax bracket for having a more comprehensive review of the various types of\nMedical insurance or various types of insurance plans quite often we can help reduce just the outgoing cost of those types of things and then of course really understanding this my investments strategy match my time in life\nAnd most people would tell you be as aggressive as your comfortable being when you are in your fifties and sixties and it's really important to take a look at that especially when you think about you know how high the stock market is right now we've done very well in the markets are everyone has 'cause everything's kind of a rising tide\nBut we know that can't last forever so taking a look at how much risk you're taking and making sure that you can't have that huge crash right at the wrong time in your life not only can give you an enormous financial benefits but\nCertainly can give you peace of mind to know that some place as well and then one of the last things I've mentioned is a this is another one that I see almost daily Gen which is\nThis people having done a great job of doing their own retirement planning and kind of pulling things together and they bring it to us kind of for that second opinion and one piece that we often see that isn't factoring in is inflation because if you live ten twenty thirty plus years\nThe one thing we know is things are gonna get more expensive so factoring that and they're making absolutely sure that you still have the same lifestyle through our retirement those are all the pieces that we think can be just enormously valuable and again just give you peace of mind that you know what's in place\nThe first step to getting started on that kind of plan for yourself\nAnd so you want to know how are they getting paid way in where's the money go sometimes the mutual fund company makes iffy sometimes the brokerage makes iffy sometimes the advisor makes defeat sometimes their manager and makes us human there's can be so many layers in there and it's not that you're saying you want someone to work for free for you you just want to understand what you're paying and is it reasonable and\nThat's something that I don't think anyone can really argue with and so it's really all about just understanding what your options are in getting to the bottom of it and if someone tells you there are no fees or so you don't have to worry about that is just a red flag because\n... again if there's something being hidden or maybe they don't even know and those are kinds of things that you want to watch out for so one of the areas that we look at when we do at no cost new obligation retirement review in addition to all the other areas of your retirement planning but we can look up and do a fee analysis and take a look kind of under the hood\nAnd rather than just looking at a statement that just has an account value we can actually research that and see what kind of fees there are and believe me we've seen a wide range we've seen people paying enormous fees four or five percent a year management fees and some of their accounts and we've seen people that are also paying close to nothing\nSo it really there's an enormous range in our industry and so valuable to get that information so you can make educated decisions for yourself\nTo get started and take advantage of that new costs no obligation offer costs now eight oh three nine retire if you said at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars for retirement costs now it mentioned the savior retirement radio show to take advantage of that free offer once again it's a two or three nine retire\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak along side in the studio if you miss that number it's eight oh three nine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nPat I think we are ready for the final item on your checklist were going through some ways to help determine if you're getting it sound appropriate financial advice\nFor your transition into retirement ... what's the last item on the list\nYes didn't lucky number seven is a assessing whether you're currently on the right track financially for retirement this is something that sounds pretty basic but you know a lot of times especially if you're working with someone who's more of an accumulation advisor\nThat they're just thinking about how do I make this pile of assets as big as absolutely possible which again is valuable it's good to have someone doing that but there's so much more right you need to figure out okay now that I'm accumulating whatever I've done over the last ten twenty thirty plus years\nHow do I turn that into a retirement plan\nAnd those are two wildly different things in the piece of the gym that I think is really important is you love to have a financial planner who gives you good news\nAnd I love being that financial planner I Will tell you I Love sharing good news but sometimes the news is an ideal him actually working with a client that we're in early stages of their planning\nAnd when we did their first analysis it was very challenging and I was not looking forward to sharing that information because there was a big gap between what they wanted to accomplish and what the resources you have I give them all the credit in the world and I said you know you've done a lot of things well you're just trying to accomplish more than the resources you have\nAnd I said let's talk through that and they really took it so well now if we do want to retire earlier\nWhat changes do we make what do we do how do we look at our budget\nHow do we look at where we're spending our money do I want to work longer or do I want to retire and work part time\nAnd so we start kind of walking through all the different possibilities and so it goes from what I was concerned about being kind of a negative conversation to really it was uplifting for me 'cause we're back to problem solving and helping them figure out how to accomplish as much of their goals as we could\nAnd you know pat I think I Want to play out before we get to the end of the show here for some people\nThey might need to change what they're doing now because they've been getting inappropriate advice but because they haven't been getting any advice at all maybe they've been trying to just do this on their own do things and sounds and they found themselves going down the wrong path what do you think\nI think you're a hundred percent right and we have a lot of clients that come to us from other financial professionals but we have a lot of people that handle things themselves\nAnd it's really more of that you know something goes off in their mind maybe something happened to their life maybe they start seeing downsizing in their company or maybe with friends or maybe someone has a health issue\nAnd it's just that realization that okay\nIt maybe it's time to get serious about this and\nI Will tell you the gym a lot of times those people have done a great job of you know accumulating assets\nNow it's just about kind of taking that one piece that they've done a great job of in now fitting that into the rest of the plan some maybe they've done a great job of accumulating four one K. accounts investment portfolios maybe even pension benefits and the next day\nThey're kind of thinking about Social Security time they're thinking about their insurance but they don't really know how to put any of that together and so we can kind of come in and it's not necessarily that they've done everything horribly wrong it's just that it's going from some kind of a simple kind of that you know blinders on accumulation to having a real plan\nPat we're just about out of time on our show today do you have any final comments forests or anything you'd like to leave our listeners with\nI think you know we talked about seven different things that I think are really really valuable Jan and the other thing that I Would sum it up with is and people may think this is kind of a flipping response but this is again just seeing it over the years when you are trying to figure out who to work with\nHow to do your retirement planning if you want to go it alone if you want a professional and if you're shopping or you know meeting with different people\nOne of the things you always want to do is trust your gut\nIf you have an opportunity to meet with someone once or twice there should be a feeling there that there are conveying information to you that you want to know that you need to know if if I shall professional is pushing a product to you you're got his probably telling you well even if that product sounds good if they're not helping me understand my plan\nThere is a missing piece there right and we always tell anyone who comes into our office window we're not perfect for everybody sometimes we have someone come into our office who wants to be really really growth minded and aggressive with they're investing that's not really us you know what we want to do is to help you grow your money if we can\nWe really want to do is preserve it and make sure you that income coming in\nBut as well and finding that balance and so there is no one perfect advisor or a company for everybody so it's about really kind of doing your due diligence and then when you talk with somebody\nTrust your gut if you have a good feeling about how that process goes we have found that quite often that that just works out very very smoothly and that gender is the reason we offer\nOur retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation because we want you to have the opportunity\nTo sit down with one of our retirement planners and see if there's a a good connection there and see if you think that our skills and our expertise is a match for what you're looking for sort of take advantage again absolutely no costs no obligation called eight oh three nine retire\nIf you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and

you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota\nTime and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a found tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck ah docks were patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are getting back to the table to have these conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either in southwest Florida a practice in Kissimmee health are pissed me was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of flirting and even from outside of the country\nWas coming down medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know please twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots one ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo a number I cashed parts for us is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nOf them that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ... topic\nIt be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally\nEverybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick um\nBut there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people\nNo we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of at the same day and I would be your patient Dr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserve service provides a fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack or accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nShow and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nWhat we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nI'm actually looking at ways a fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending way and if I could\nAdd add to that just a a ... you know the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... armored care practices providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nAh so little stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plan was called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month a\nLot but what it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\n... everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness how did you get\nTo who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there right\nLet's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida huh hum I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that\nBecause we weighed you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can buy quick\nBreak we'll come

seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nAh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nEnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the they attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ... end up this rage not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe thinks he's been called treasonous they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapists or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas
