make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher ... over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so\nEverybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein now think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim combing he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer\nApplication to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page or\nThe bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's the night and it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness and if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there's no there are there but anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing tool is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ...\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she's really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot

NASDAQ plunging more than four percent it's biggest point drop in Eighteen years\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox show you a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty\nThe Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections is is a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me\nAnd hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they've built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they won't massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host and and a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have in the end up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet if you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and I ... that is not just made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nFuture ... and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his grade can tell you most of these cases that are very important to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open I ... and I say this is Shaun\nCarolina are still cleaning up after Hurricane Florence want the region with record rainfall last month\nNow the fast moving category ... storm is expected to dump anywhere from three to five inches of rain across the Carolinas by tomorrow\nGovernor McMaster has extended the state of emergency declaration that's been in effect since before Hurricane Florence last month he says the state is ready to remind everyone to listen to the directions of local officials\nState grand jury report that was released to the public yesterday outlines\nThe special prosecutor David Pascoal has found after an extensive investigation into alleged corruption at the state house\nThe report says attorney general Allen Wilson cooperated with political consultant Richard ... senior and played a part in putting off the investigation into quaint and his clients Quinn said he didn't know of any wrongdoing and releases the news radio five sixty WBRC\nPretty quiet out there this evening but late tonight or early tomorrow morning tropical storm Matthew will be slamming into the midlands watch out for flooded roads in very strong winds with the possibility of power outages for channel twenty five ABC Columbia I'm chief meteorologist John Farley\nHey it's John rash jelly man when I saw it appears that the state of South Carolina and we want to be gangsta\nBut somebody needs to go to ... to school around here was playing that next\nWell Jonathan and I both read the state newspaper with bated breath about the headlines skin a paid Quinn from for access to legislators corruption probe finds this was the\nLong awaited corruption probe that David past go who authored and we wanted to see and that sounds like ... what's going on there the profound they paid for access to legislators the definition\nOf a lobbyist these you pay the lobbyist for access to legislate it and try to influence those that's what they do that's what the law says they do then\nYou say well they must be doing something illegal even in the report we don't see anything illegal I read it three times I'm getting to figure out where's the illegal part in this well then at the very end of it we find out the skin of paid to make this whole thing go away a grand total of Seventy two thousand dollars\nThat's it for scanner yes and they also said almost out of a G. N.

mean that's sad are we missing something you get back to us on Twitter that rash thought [noise]\nBoy and\nFake news gives utilize today's applies the crew Sean Hannity is on right now\nBut fortunately this is going because hurricane warning guys because all of them and the U.S has hated was hurt they come into play so the storm surge Smith or anywhere between nine and fourteen the\nStorm surge is going to be the worse where the slant on just to the east or south of where the landfall\nSomewhere right now to project in between them city that are going to push forward so not only is he going to bring forty feet of ocean water but in addition there'll be wave action on top of that which is the primary driver of why we evacuated service\nAnd then a couple of that you got over a hundred and forty five miles per hour winds [noise] um [noise] you know your structures built for two thousand and one or not as on to to handle that I went\nTo college and uh it's gone unfortunately push through these days so we're asking us citizens in southwest Georgia separate or just to be vigilant and make sure that they understand what it comes to this area is going to see a cat one\nStorm moves in hand with the vegetation there while we're anticipating is a lot of down trees are impacting the power in and uh you know here again we're going to see a lot of damage devastation along the coast structurally [laughter] and then as it moves and you're going to see power outages throughout the state\nThat was Brock Long FEMA administrator I was saying that hurricane Michael is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind Michael striking the Florida Panhandle uh ... dead the hit\nAnd wins now gusting up to a hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nUh the damages severe it is hitting a maximum of strength now as we speak or we welcome back to the program a good friend Joe ... is the official meteorologist or the Sean Hannity show with weather bell dot com well everything predicted as we talked earlier in the program today has come true\nThis is a bad bad storm it's they're now in the middle of it\nAnd uh it's more devastating than we even thought it could be\n[laughter] well we had it going to as a category for my company from Sunday and as a matter of fact I I you know and my dad used to always say to me the if you have to tell somebody said something you must know set it loud enough but not everybody hears things a few days away so it was actually a that we put it out publicly with a patriot post\nWhich is a conservative blog I Do a Monday morning telling people bad it's going to be but look here's the thing with this storm folks the first thing is this is not climate change or any evidence of it okay\nSo you could see this coming you could see the whole pattern come in fact I talked to Shaun ... on the sixteenth of September I said I'll I'll be seen you get an October probably because of the Gulf\nRight now you said it right on this show I Know yeah right right on the show and you could see the pattern setting up everything got together\nAnd that's why and you see that every once in a while but let me put it in perspective is the worst storm ever to hit between mobile and camp out that I can find on records okay now you know when the ten thousand years ago something that we're so we're not sugarcoat that\nBut on the other hand it's not because of your educate All right this is what nature is capable of doing and you could see this pattern setting up\nPretty far in advance it's also one of only a handful of storms the last twenty five years including Harvey by the way that hit at its peak Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida which weakening off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes and we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to go in and look at the damage\nBut there's a lot more left to this storm folks because even though it's weakening hurricane force winds are going to go all the way in a central Georgia I've got to be ... to one Seventy five but they're going to be ... to eighty Ninety a hundred miles an hour\nAt Atlanta you will escaped the worst but August it's probably going to come right over Augusta very\nClose to Columbia South Carolina just north of pay a bill by this time tomorrow when we're talking and then it will move off the mid

Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the daily basis I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the daily\nBeast and but he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin\nMary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and happened over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech in a little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bench repair has ever been around involve marshmallows in small cars\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump ... to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob a\n... totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other word is that it doesn't go put a stop on what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that delightful she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a steward Varney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her rent joined her she had her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville [noise]\nUh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nMy friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these has mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protests this described is mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests lived up to that that are in the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ...\nIf they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken it the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nBy what we saw\nChasing we've right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that civil protest or that a mob I think it's easily along\nJoin the army or a high school because in my era or Jimmy Carter was president John ... just like a bomb or you can

[noise]\n\nWas his new democratic or any other you go\nThat's why but let's say it doesn't get any plane or them that\nThey're not shying away from it now see the Democrats the leadership of the Democratic party they had\nTwo choices here they could have been the grown ups in the room stepping forward and saying as much as we disagree with President Trump and the Republicans and justice cabin all\nAnd we opposed his a confirmation process we as a party did not endorse or in any way support the activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now\nIn our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they this is their base they have decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now\nThan in condemning the mob that's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets to get in\nThey knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse\nInstead of condemning\nMob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weaponized saying the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon than that to be used\nWe will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob in the streets and so you stepped up and condemn the mob only then can we actually have a civil conversation in the meantime if you're a mob if you're endorsing the mob if you're supporting the mob\nThen we will warn the rest of this country that if they vote for your party they are empowering the mob\nSo election is twenty seven days away when mark live in gets behind this microphone for weeks from

that well if you're a public official then it's okay to follow people around and hound them and keep them from having any peace couldn't be further from the truth\nAnd you draw an analogy to the Tea Party which was nothing ever but perfectly peaceful they would leave a place cleaner than when they found it because he's a journalist covering\nAn authorized organized rally\n... that's not the same as people invading a restaurant and and screaming at them until they leave or for that matter a spontaneous march in the middle of the street where they stopped traffic and disrupt people's lives is

Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey bastard Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate\nEven if no senator as opposed to understand is that Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey buster clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one Vassar and Germany and and once he got there boy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing\nThe uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran and Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists ... Iran\nBecause they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that is what Trump one way it's because they didn't have as an acid or there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed cloture this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there\nLanguishing for each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to muck up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nBack to the editorial here the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W.
