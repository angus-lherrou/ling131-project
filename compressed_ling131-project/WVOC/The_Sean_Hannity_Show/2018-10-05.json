I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today\nUh that that really much impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by senator Collins and what was the most rebutting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers\nUm what it means ah the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax a great what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was ...

the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence in fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence or and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all and said show under penalty of perjury so she presented that\nThat was very suddenly the most impressive but I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation

I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters I'm sure you know you've done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and up until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged\nAnd I think they act\nIt's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats could look ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at the map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans start from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man and this family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents\nWho supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is\nTrump voters coming back in and\nGet along really well and ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago but less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence or\nThe need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and the fans Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nSean I don't quite know how to reply off your ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is an ongoing leaving the house which I think it\nCan lead to pick up the house can either from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back in a week or ten days after Kavanaugh is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out I think there is a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her writings of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as the today probably some evidence that that\nIs gonna it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did it to the man for support\nFor disgusting and somebody who why do you ...

I'm not saying she isn't possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victims ... sexual assault and they go out in the murders somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were victims ... sexual assault somewhere there life\nAbsolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do the right cab and I'm One hundred percent certain it was bred Cavanaugh\nMachine not trying to effectively ruin that man's life\nHis family's life how evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she wants ... sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just white off because ... gonna make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine\nBored because there will be others we\nEnd up uh ... the biggest issue we could have had this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know Chuck Schumers credibility or the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in ...

you know you can find that the market\nAnd the saddest thing about mark in Montgomery is that it it went down during the recession that was that was maybe one of the saddest moments during the entire

just\nOh by the way I Am Brian mud and for the great one mark\nBen and uh get to some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the market then show just take those straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have a receipt and the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is they tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people in this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberals there are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm gala that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it in other words\nMost seven percent of this country was even persuadable and Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now eating and all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive the first thing\nFind the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make\nBy lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable or is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive and looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I'd closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's ... eldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah and you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it\nRight now is one of the most important windows of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent

[noise]\nUnder\nThe age of fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nAnd there it is and I have ... for more than Happy Friday I Hope you have\nHad a a wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven the Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting I took him four and Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... ah it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so ah the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something interesting that\nDeveloped out of Alaska Lisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she did not want to end debate then again if debate did not end today basically Kevin I Would have been dead they would have been it right there are the procedural vote today absolutely critical so with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way is they've been going about it not screaming not protesting not people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office uh was phone calls them know how can certainly are\nThere have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have a ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions do to impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit ruling ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court would stand for all Alaskans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nWhen I was taking a look at the most likely outcome here\nOr it looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process is the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nI have known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know but they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man when he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role\nOh a role model that we can all point to natural to me only one I think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one I think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model and we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's going to Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody that seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right places they just the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this than it actually works and that's important from the point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYou know there are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by\nBut they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment and we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn but they never would have learned and have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does it the right\nWay doesn't back down\nWe'll be right back I'm In for the gray one Marshall of him\nBut we had been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk you back real quick to the president's election twenty six same\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty six team when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it is based upon historical trends simply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats as he did a full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all during the primary process especially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running isn't Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good this and that ... vote for the person didn't believe in\nBecause the odds are the Republican candidate what when\nAnd sure enough there you go now in the context the mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent presidents party loses generally in fact there's only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifties\nThan the incumbent presidents party has actually gain seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nPlugs employ American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush\nIn the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map favorable for them\nHeidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was likely to be a no vote about ten points about ten points where the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia devoted gas Joe mansion by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this\nAgain when I've been taking a look at for ... and how much this vote meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump broke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you take a lot of getting ... if he'd check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pace in somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which would be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nMy question is and this is what I'm working out because again I base everything off of information are we add an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression not after nine eleven\nIf you're looking for a ... pie absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right\nThere are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the more investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house I could be analogous you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment in time than inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there is an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nColombia's home for Rush Limbaugh news radio vines sixty W.

your thoughts so let's go to many in Anchorage, Alaska and and then he understand that uh you're you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of a senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wasn't on the for the Senate then have all the trappings but Lindsay made those other members on that Judiciary Committee eighty eight there spinach\nOkay exactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle\nHe didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing

say what needed to be sent to the members of that condition committee they were acting uh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's fight as moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote and it was ... eastern time but Lindsey Graham\nA week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where he sped up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ended up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I knew that they can figure that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to fix up here I rest and not every day and believe me the people I Can't remember very many calls for him to win a hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have been um\nUm we hope she'll vote for a ... a cabin on\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there is an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through his comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although what should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater,

they do run damage control things less than the damage to that that's what I saw I think it actually her ... her speech was scripted\nShe did not speak like the protests was written\nSo I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they righteously have towards them and less than",
