Fox News President Trump at first lady Melania Trump spending part of the day in parts of the south rather just by hurricane Michael\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic you know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under the effects of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes\nOf course they're going to do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they have been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal\nMedia he does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's\nA you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance it she re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis is a a it's just Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical Trump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period end the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media pace this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they go on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSoul tries to stop\n'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end\nAnd you know Leslie and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what\nI think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits it hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity so we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a a just a litany of fraud in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they are\nThey based their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\nI mean who\nWhat other presidents other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\n\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to

us in a area sensitive to my heart to go pick it up our police by jak live and [noise]\nUm so folks before the break I was talking about the just the Trump message cells because of an authenticity that often\nSo he is not necessarily without battle scars I'm not suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with the American people\nIs he's a plane speaking authentic guy who says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense this cells\nNow I bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall I\nKnow it because I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who is honest to God I'm afraid there'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great to be with\nContrast that with the frauds and the Democrat side\nElizabeth Warren putting out a press conference press release today that ... one one five trillion to Native Americans or whatever it was one one thousand and twenty fourth or whatever and it's so ridiculous the guy running against cruise in Texas who whose whose entire campaign seems to be that he skate boards\nHe can skateboard and play the guitar as if this is that's great that's wonderful what the hell does that have to do with tax policy anything at all pleased pure pure who cares\nThen you've got these Bernie Sanders [noise] you know foreign left radical left this time she got this guy Andrew Gillum running down here for governor in Florida speak their social is they don't want your money they want the whole economy\nAnd they try to frame it in this off you guys have rich people the rich people are getting over they're not paying their fair share of really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today but I saw a fascinating piece in Bloomberg of all I'm not a big\nHuge fan of the ... but once in a while they have good articles on economics and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIf I say let me just say something numbers so much it's the comparisons\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners paying astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country I think about that\nOne out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute\nYou may say okay well you know the one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\n\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent view liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff\n[noise] pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nSo pick about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... probably you're not that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not that Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts over with a\nYou know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load\nThan the bottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share of that is not is you hear what I'm ... there's more about this isn't just that\nThere's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg peace again not some right wing website\nHere I mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberal listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is this so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have yet Al Sharpton is tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or um so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely\nYou read it for the rich no no no no no no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share is fair shall we used to be able to make us don't be stupid talking point rich still beta fish or they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of Florida but to say All right if you want to give us a call

I mean it was like all the ... what it was with one thing but we moved on and that was kinda kinda my point about the um the ...\nYou got to talk with one I'm Sorry you can talk about Elizabeth Warren of you on\nOh I mean I was just going to the point that you're talking about the one guy skateboarding\nBut then like sharing on dial because because he got all those of us want to do that like what did we win I mean when I go oh my God it was one of my thoughts I mean I think it's kind of it I mean I I just think it's so ... like I I just think that the white as going social justice and the opposite direction of uh what in this\nPersonally it's driving me crazy and I'm really get a eight Trump supporters if they get Elizabeth Warren elected in school and he thought he could God\nI disagree though I Know I'll tell you why\nThe left having run myself a ball being unsuccessfully almost doesn't count politics is you know but you know listen I gave it the old college try out a lot of experience um in liberal states Marilyn specifically where I did run and one of the things I've always not lights but respect\nAnd about the Democrats is their ability to almost ruthlessly stay on message follow me here whether it was Obamacare the Obama tax hikes you Obama regulatory assault in red tape on our businesses they are on message no matter what\nObama cares about we got to get more coverage the tax cuts we got to make people pay their fair share about regulations we got to protect the environment and you fill in the black\nThey are almost ruthlessly good at staying on message Donald Trump has been so fragile so frazzled that just and it just why am I Try to be a target is why no you're wrong\nThat just weeks before a midterm election a major party representative for their party Elizabeth Warren releases an ancestry or whatever it DNA thing showing she's one one thousand uh twenty fourth Native American\nAnd even Jim Messina who was an Obama big shot advisor tweeted out today\nWhat the heck are you doing three weeks before mid term\nSo I'd I'd with all due respect job I get what you're saying\nI could not disagree with you more I think it was a genius political move and I'm not a golden calf worship or of any politician I think it was a genius move to entirely get the Democratic party to not talk about anything of substance and to focus on what Trump wants to focus on their fraudulent\nNature rather than what they want [noise] so I got to take a break on I'm Sorry thanks for the call I see your point but I totally totally disagree there is no one\nGot a PHD in owning the lift a fellow she gets under their skin like no one on the part of their bonds you know with the market you want to give us a call it's seven seven zero one read one more than

it out you know what I'm Talking about\nYou believe in those now too as well you were isolated from the truth\nOh they need is one of the ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clintons surpluses met they would go away forever but they won't\nDo it they do this and now\nThey're doing it now and the reason I bring it up is because they are good at staying on message that's how they get these myth to persist over time Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message\nYou got one guy who ... if you got one guy I skateboard in the parking lot better now you got one guy talking about fart jokes\nAt a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\n\nI fundamentally disagree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I've always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it\nThey are so overtaken with rage at everything this guy represents the anti swamp rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruth in straight up\nLive they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\nHe's got them talking about booth failing in Senate hearings he's got a Cory Booker declaring he's a sporadic is from the or at least you're silverstone clueless movie\nHe's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I'm One one thousand Native American jobs by the way a Fox on in the background the Cherokee Nation just responded\nAnd and in a brutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\n\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media and turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans this is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and they're swamp rat Democrats back on their heels 'cause they don't know\nHow to respond anymore the standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears you know I said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is Don apologizing\nFor taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happened to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not given tax cuts for the\nRich why why are we not doing that why well because it'll look that well is it good for the economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was\nMake the case Trump does see\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat do fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\n... do you understand the gravity of what I just do the fourth team hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country can't liberal delusional\nLiberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a as a one percent of one percent or\nWill still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even mean it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn it you might as well burn it you're flushing it down a toilet Milton\nFriedman I haven't brought this up in a while either\nSo it's worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great Milton Friedman he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back this way to spend money summarizes completely why the government\nGiving the government money is a total complete epic disaster\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right\nNew spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing batters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy stuff was going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying\nSo much it's not yours\n\nOther people there's another way to speed it less efficient other people can spend other people's money on themselves you going to work trip\nYou your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room this quality matter yeah you're damn right is your hotel room you want the best hotel room after but there's the cost\nThat no no it doesn't matter that's the jobs money yeah yours give me the\nThe the the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it\nCost them matter you may say wow that sounds like a really an efficient way to spend money all the way it gets worse it gets even worse\nOther people spending other people's money on other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never run here this folks other people spending other people's money and other people what is that it's the government it is the ... pool of government taking your tax dollars to think about the government's taking your money and spending it on other people does it cost matter\nHow no it ain't their money they don't care what they're buying this equality matter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care they're just giving\nPeople money while we're going to pay for their health a yeah but it's crappy out we don't care taxpayer money whatever just go to this friend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst\nPossible way to spend my the government is better off taking your tax dollars and buying themselves lamborghini's at least they look for a quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it all the people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nAnd billionaires pay and then and said oh you think we should\nSend the greatest phone call ever this is the ... can you please
