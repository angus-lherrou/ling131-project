... in ...\nAnd said thank you for having me I I Want to I Want to ... a lot less um you know people are coming to this country for a reason whether they're trying to seek asylum\nOr whatever situation that's the thing is with those people are coming to take care of it we don't know the ... we haven't had any real data or information to say\nThese people are here trying to do this just to to political start\nOrder actually come this country because they're trying to get up on them all trying to go out with all the countries where the law is so far beyond what we can be recovered handled laws I mean you don't want to understand why they're really take the ...\nWell I I doubt they're willing to take the risk but I also think that if we do allow people into this country\nThan a year and then what you're doing is I think you're incentivizing people to take these risk across in their lives and their kids' lives\nYou know there may be some security and the numbers of how many people were there right there may be some security\nIn the press it there it's following them a ... and for the stability that comes to supporting them along the way because this caravan is a caravan that's being followed by the international press they're all following them they are all telling their stories they're all trying to make you feel sorry for somebody I mean that\nThat's something that they are clearly trying to do\nUh they're they're trying to humanize and to basically make you feel like there's no way you could say no there's no way that you could say\nA this is wrong you know that that that that you know you're you're somehow evil if you say I want you to be able to do it the right way or you should be doing it the right way and so if you do with them all and then what does that say the rest of the world is going to you're going to have a lot of people that are probably being taken advantage of by coyotes\nPeople that may lose their lives you have to I I Believe you must respond\nWhen clearly showing that this is not how we work in this country so don't take the risk don't take the journey don't take the track because if you do you are wasting your time\nBut the thing that but it is a lot of those people are on education they don't they don't even know what they're coming into they do not even know\nThat there's a possibility that can be military force when I hit the border that they're going to be deported immediately that they may be sent back to the countries where they could be I mean as far as we know that could be murder for going back to their own countries we don't know yeah the whole situation\nAnd you know me personally I Know people who come here illegally from El Salvador while I'm all it is bad I mean what they do their children what the government does to their children what government people and employees\nAnd please do I have no ... is what I've said before I have no doubt that if I was poor and living in one of those impoverished countries that I wouldn't want out\nI have no ... you know you could argue that there are conditions while traveling the country are probably on par with the conditions they live and if they stay in their homes or they're or they're ... or whatever it may be where they're coming from\nRight because it's so bad uh I I don't think it's much worse on the road for them so it doesn't seem to be so there you know us doing this you'd say there's no way I'm going to go walk two thousand five hundred and I don't I don't think\nWe should open our doors and say you know everybody just come on in and we're going to be free everything now first off I like to know who who's give me that data that they go right on welfare because I've lived in South west Missouri and central Kansas\nAnd you know they have children legally\nBorn in the U.S they're us citizens I don't like you have a problem with that\nRight but and us taking care of the citizens but the parents they get nothing the kids you know yeah we put them in school and we give them that little two dollar lunch when they're in school but my go home they have nothing the parents what worked the junkiest jobs that can get\nBecause they can't get regular jobs because they weren't so dirty numbers you know you got to give you their hats off to them because they're willing to put up with our beach as far as way of life\nBut to them it's better than going back to what they came from\nAnd I I Will say a lot of ... ... ... ... ...\nNo let me get this point out one quick I Know that there's people who thought they were trying to do it legal trying to go to a a a a\nImmigration attorney and pay him or her thousands of dollars and got taken advantage of by because they weren't even legal attorneys\nBut there are so\nLow that there's always there's always people David out there that can be swindle you and I know that and that's unfortunate but that again is not my problem what we should have is consistency 'cause world ...

calling them come in this country this is political do not buy into the idea that it's not\nPolitical it is absolutely political every ... every thing about this political every part of this is political everything that's going on with us is political everybody needs to understand that it's political everybody needs to comprehend that this is\nPolitical\nThey're hoping that this is going to be a disaster they're hoping that this is going to blow up in our faces they're hoping that this is going to be something where people are going to sit there and go oh my gosh\n\nI Can't believe this is happening oh my gosh I cannot believe that this is going down all my gosh look at how the Republican Party is training Donald Trump sent the military to the border that is so unfair they should have never done that how terrible of them to do that\nHow awful it if they did that everybody should be ashamed that this happened that's what they're hoping for\n\nSo let's get to your phone calls on this and see what you think the number one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to Paul in Alaska you're on the bench ... nice to have it's nice to have you on a Saint Paul go ahead\nI think you can you hear me okay\nScenario just fine sir\nRight well first of all of where we are going to take issue with three of your poise before we\nGo there I Want to say this God list Donald Trump and those people who love them as our prison that we've had great American in the states and then ... and I'm white right level seven floors less eager to know I like your show and I'm calling to contributed opinion is I like what you're doing\nThat so even if we disagreed who is you know thank you for your show so here's where we go\nWe're letting everything you've said Brett was correct\nThey're setting this up as a political event with the truth is they're doing this because our leaders are letting them framed the narrative this is not a care of the head of the illegal immigrants\nThis is an invasion is a new age invasion with co sponsors\nThose cosponsors need to be painted [noise] they need to be published\nSo we can see what's happening this is the same thing as an insect world this is not complicated is not conflicts people in this United States are desperate because our country is split up because they've lost their moral foundations and their mission is a great country those people that that hate Donald Trump here's what you have\nThose people who have no place to go because they said for so long enough to public trough\nThat they know they have no place to go there now doing acts of desperation this this in the illegal invasion coming into our country is being sponsored\nI Would think that research a I'm a reporter will be down in a heartbeat trailing all of that funding in one more thing\nWell I mean the logistics of this that logistics of this are clear I mean there there are so many people that are clearly invested in the logistics of this caravan ... they're they're willing to go two thousand miles they know they're going to be taken care of\nThere's obviously a schedule when it comes to logistics because the media is clearly sleeping somewhere every night and it's on the side of the road\nThe media is following this and all the major media groups or they're following this the entire way\nRight but but the point is you have to have accountability and you have to have rational or you have to pay the price for your actions and right now we're not to live for example are starting to see a minute ago the union is a damn well better be recording these phone calls these foreign countries or coke and spirit and he was sort of our people\nTo break us as a country we all we can we can speak for three weeks a logistics of eastern person crosses the border the monetary impact our children\nHow can these people go their neighbor to say look I think you're chose not deserving but I think the one in Puerto Rico or Mexico or one of the many many\nCentral South American countries does deserve it so what's happening is the fruits of our labor of being evil and sent out to a foreign country so that they can break the law to support those people here in my opinion or traders\nSo as long as you use terms like a carrot and you're listening to frame the narrative\nThese people I think if I don't want to repeat myself but the point is do we invade Mexico do we invaded so central and South America\nI don't I don't think ... years I'll say I don't think we invade I don't think anybody has the stomach or the appetite for that I Do think that you don't need the only ... I heard you out of her job probably let me finish I don't think we invade anything\nI I don't think there's a appetite to invade I don't think we should do that\nUm I think what we should do is we should defend our border I don't think this is about ... thing I'm going after somebody I think this is about protecting your board and that's the reason why I think the president has ITS America showed a realistic response by saying\nAnd this is an important thing by saying that we would he would send the military to the border to protect\nThis country if he needs to and that is vitally important one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let me go to Paul in California\nPaul you in California we've seen what happens round two of this uh illegal immigration from Europe Democrats out there that are not only advocating for glamorous to vote but wanting them to vote in state and local elections\n\nCorrect answer with school cell phone with show children don't speak English\nAnd they're sucking up all their tax dollars and I'd like to say that the Mexican government is complicit I've travelled extensively throughout Mexico I'm aware of their passport laws and the tourists he's why don't some hundred Americans probably marching south let's see how far they get they'll be put in jail but at the time to get so the\nTwenty kilometer mark\nI wouldn't be I mean you go if you started care of and you go to Mexico and I guarantee you are going to be stopped by the Mexican government there's absolutely no way that you wouldn't be\nOn both sides once these guys get up to the border\nThey have to do is put one foot over the border and lay down into political asylum\nSure and they know that that's why they do it\nEven if the middle some stormy there we can't rent them up because I'm going to end up on the nightly news\nWell you you and I both know that this is how this works I mean everybody knows this this is this is how it works on average everybody everybody knows this is what you do this is how it works this is how you exploit the system and if you could point this isn't this way it works out great\nGod Bless Donald Trump", "show_name": "Ben Ferguson Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "22"}
