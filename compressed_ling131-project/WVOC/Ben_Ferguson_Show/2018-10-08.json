News\nOr um a lot of people here at the apple barrel [noise]\nOut in the parking lot and then I heard screaming a limo\nReportedly heading to a birthday party crashes in upstate New York yesterday killing all Eighteen people inside limousine\nIs the pundit put out a tweet like summit Jews to a mobster the false rape accusations weren't personal they were just business\nBut cabin on may feel differently others said completely agree if you signed that letter and are consistent you should want nothing at all to do with cabbage and all this is what they refer to as business as usual\n\nThis is business as usual\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to let's get to your phone calls and see what you think about this\nUh I go back to what was said earlier by Mitch McConnell in the Senate majority leader about the dysfunction ascent saying they did this to Brett Kavanaugh we didn't they're the ones that attacked and here's a little bit more about that\nThe only point out banks or a duck tried to get an argument with you is you oppose the FBI investigation\nNo it doesn't uh it was negotiated in office a week we agreed on the parameters of the rest of the ocean in a meeting a law office friday a week ago Senator McCaskill center recall and Senator Flake that was the scope of the ... where are you ready to go on for a week\nAnd we ... we would talk to people that Dr ... and the people that are Romero said mentioned about the investigation that was done\nAnd our members who are undecided took a look at the a report and two or three of them decided to support the nominee Senator McConnell ... but it's about crowd shouting is outrageous to compare Brett Kavanaugh Roy Moore\nI didn't do so I was simply comparing the fact that in one case you believe the accusers and they're not the case you didn't I'm not comparing judge Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh\nWho good because there is no comparison [laughter] on that were great thank you for your time today sir\nBy the way I Love this I Love this and you heard the question there about Roy Moore well you you you believe one and the one case send you didn't and the other case\n\nYou believe one in one case you didn't you don't have the right to look at the facts this is another part of that liberal leftist extremism then I was telling you about earlier\nI I Am I have to ... and by the way I didn't support or more and I tell people to vote against Roy Moore\nI told people do not vote for Roy Moore\nI said I Know where to go to a Democrat I don't care you don't put someone like that on the Supreme Court that's what I said you don't put people on the Supreme Court like Roy Moore that is not something that you do\n\nI did not support Roy Moore\nAnd they say well I guess you gotta support every accuser out there you must support every person that accuses anybody of anything so I Can't look at the facts and realize that I think Roy Moore was clearly a shady guy who didn't deserve to to be in in Congress and the other Republicans in Alabama agreed with me\nAnd then therefore if I if I go if I say no to Roy Moore I must say no to Brett Kavanaugh otherwise I I I'm I'm I I mean that's just absurd\nWhy can't I judge each person on their own merit and that's part of what Lindsey Graham had to say about this Wednesday Graham was asked about this\nAnd he was asked in a way that I thought was incredibly condescending 'em\nBy Chris Wallace this morning wow you know and they were they they went to him and said look you kind of been all over the place you bet angry you been upset you've been this you've been that and he said no I'm not I saw someone getting railroaded and that's exactly what I did I stood up for that individual\nI set up for an individual that deserve to be set up for because what happened to them was disgusting what happened to him was was was absolutely disgusting and that's why I got angry and that's why I got mad and that's why I was frustrated\n\nThat's why I was so upset that is why I was so frustrated listen is part of this conversation [noise]\nHas gotten so much on New Year's get I

I've known for Twenty years and it's never been banned from a mall\nRoy Moore failed I'm\nHappy that those who tried to destroy his life's too short\nI'm Glad those who've tried to overturn the rule of law and replace it with mob rule last\nI've never been more pissed in my life I voted for so tomorrow and Kagan our never done this to them this character assassination this was warning power too much to the extent that I came to the age of this good man and helped defeat this debacle I'm happy as a ...\nWell let me tell you or something that may not make you happier bring it up\nBecause it

and ...\nA Bush supporter and everybody running for president on our side believed that Brett Kavanaugh and ... were outstanding conservative jurists the other side wants to cancel the election so Chuck\nYou want somebody new look at this list and see if there's anybody you agreed to but what you want to do Senator Schumer is to overturn the election you pick the judges were not don't let you pick the judge is if you want to paint judges then you need to win the White House\nWhen a Obama won I voted for two judges that have pit so Chuck Schumer name one person on this list she thinks the

successes that have gone on in the black community why can't you be happy for that and you're even pointed out how they celebrated Obama being a food stamp president which I think it's appalling\nYou know and you were dead on dead on when you said that you know the Democratic party as slave or a minority\nOr a ... into thinking that you know the only way that they could survive if the Democrats see this is what I've grown up with\nI've grown up with that type of narrative that the Democrats for a black folks that minorities working class and the Republicans before white folks rich both that's what we grow up hearing this guy is not an anomaly\nSeat the Republican Party had better be careful with this upcoming election\nWe're taking this stuff for granted like the one guy that the fight is oh no this fighting over no no no no no the Democrats and not let this slave do so easily it's not all happened oh no that's a whole voting bloc you're talking about they don't care about the

there was life outside of the projects this is what they program us to believe\nWell and and the other thing is is I'm assuming that your family probably based on the way you're describing the story correct me obviously if I'm wrong\nBut it seems to be that you're telling the same story that you hear from so many others that live in poverty on food stamps that your family that was just they
