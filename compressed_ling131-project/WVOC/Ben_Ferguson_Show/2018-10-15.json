insane individual instead of respecting his opinion and saying he's an Uncle Tom because he's not being a quote real black man opinion\nWhat should I listen all and you just said something earlier that when you said living on food stamps is not a lifestyle living outside the gate the majority of black people have to think you still have that sort of the United states population of most people don't live like that you might need so much in the inner cities and things like they can't attribute that to everybody black because\nThat I didn't I didn't the number one recipient of welfare in this

Americans are Democrats\nIt has no I'm a Democrat the Republican like that have nothing to do with it the issue is\nSure it does it has everything to do with when a Republican when we look at what

for his intelligence said that he doesn't even read all because he sat down with Donald Trump\nAnd I thought so that was supposed to be tolerant of other people's viewpoints listen to this\nIs what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stay with me to take pictures [noise]\nJust look at it [laughter] I must say\nBlack folks aren't that says you train Kanye West and the racial draft okay\nThey had it with him and he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues either I\nI mean he's clearly has issues wow all because you are a black person that comes out as a Republican\n\nAnthony or I I I Will I or go back to you because I just think this is just such a sad\nLike to have them in a bottle [laughter]\nThat's just what does that commentary\nIs is that lists that I'm a curious Justin I'm old country boy ... is praying and read\nAll of the Bible belt folks around you know they don't forget that they can go and they called it they got to go watch it up and down the street it's going to go out and go to pray and makes them think chain you see the whole litter corrupted in the ...\nThe guts of the president put forward and currently a F the man guilty of a platform this he\nSaid oh we need to say something\nAnd if he is up there we go listing\nYou see what I'm saying that he got to do more than a Buddhist so you know we gotta stay in the brain so he got to say something that's relevant to the condition of the people and then they will listen to it\nAnd uh I Love to teach him some rec room some government will soon history\nAnd and the strengthening the I'm not going to get no better down if I could be or your Bible and under which\nYou know what I mean 'cause that's not the way that's not the way the world and and I really believe\nThat if we went and our closets and what the ...\nHe lean more toward a you're studying about cursing it and in in in the long run they exist and legit and putting them down you hey he the president of United States of America\nCan't you know what ... ... and kind of either way more than ...\nTalked about that Anthony county I at the Obamas talked about the president saying the Democrats basically what's wrong with you guys don't you understand 'em or what you're doing here when you attack the president of the United states of America and here here's Tanya a in his own words in the oval office on this issue he don't\nHe has to be to pressure the fly by plane the best factory and we have to pay our\nFree empower we have to bring jobs into America because\nIs entertainment of ideas but when we make everything is China not America were cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions that you are legal things they end up in the cheapest factory ever or the\nWe have to release for the love\nOf the entire country and give them an opportunity a lot of times it's just the overall\nOf reparations that we see any given point we've said this is this is this is this is racist so we don't have the reparations but we have we got to open up the whole conversation liberal would try to control a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're proud emotional\nPeople when I feel like Trump to like someone is liberal they'll say oh well he's right you'd think racing okay\nI'm a U.S ... anything is there anything there that he just said\nAnd I quote Democrats I said is anything that he just said they're quote crazy on hand just out of control any of it\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for\nNine seven three to or if you or Facebook or you can watch this we're about to go live on Facebook Live as well we do have to sort out of the show every Sunday night so join us on Facebook and about five minutes been Ferguson show they're on Facebook All right we'll come back our three been Ferguson's show\nBecause Kanye West is an authentic black man\nKanye West is a real African American man that lives in an African American world that is a part of African American culture\nClarence Thomas was never a real threat to the hard core Democratic Party that's black because they already turned him into a white guy who married by the way a white woman they slandered him that way\nYou didn't have to worry about Ben Carson being a real black man for example because Ben Carson was too smart that's what I was told by a blackout a Democrat\nWho said well he's not a real black man said why it's like he's he he he literally act like it was a kind of thing that he's ... he's a neurosurgeon he's on he's not a real black man it's not a real black man so if you're successful and as a doctor you're no longer a black man well he never grew up in the neighborhood that I grew up that OK\nKanye West it by the way\nTony west of the guy that also has said things that were cheered by the left and the Democratic party when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people at that fundraiser after Hurricane Katrina hit\nAnd nobody said that Kanye West was an Uncle Tom then no one said he wasn't black then no one said he was crazy that no one said he was bipolar that was the Democratic party has done this week 'cause they've done two things that kind of a west\nAll because\nHe wears a make America great again hats well challenging the president issues like stop and frisk which a lot of African Americans I think would agree with me is a policy that they feel like is an inappropriate policy based on race\nThat it allows police officers to target minorities disproportionately stop and frisk that's the reason why judges said it was unconstitutional it's the reason why it will not be done in any city in this country because it will be immediately shut down\nBullet Kanye West's they've done two things that kind of this week one they've taken away any of his accomplishments by saying that he has an ignorant dumb man\nHe is an ignorant and dumb man in fact democratic leaders came out and they said they said this about ... they said that ... I'm going to play this for you because I Want you to hear it they said this about Kanye West\nSays rapidly negroes don't read\nKanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nWas rapidly negroes don't read\nKanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nOne more time with is what happens when they grow don't read\nNow\nDid anybody say that about Kanye West when he came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people know because he was a hero Vin of the left but what Kanye West is doing now is Kanye West is a guy who is\nHas a lot of influence in the African American community and they know it and they're terrified so they've got to turn them into a crazy man this week I heard people say that the president was taking advantage of a mentally unstable man that clearly needs to be in a hospital\nAll because he supports president the United states America now now what did he say that was so crazy and again I said this earlier if you're watching it on Facebook Live a please share this video\nSo that hopefully other African Americans are thinking about maybe not voting party lines in the midterms who might be thinking about voting for some Republicans who actually see this I Hope that this goes viral hope a million two million people\nHere this because I'm trying to lay out the incredible amount of racism is coming from the Democratic party towards African Americans African Americans the Democratic party they don't they don't respect your intelligence\nIn fact they don't want you to become an independent thinker because it's a threat to their party they don't want you to have\nGood paying jobs because then you don't need the Democratic party more for government aid and welfare they don't want you to be successful schools that's the reason why they keep you and your kids in failing schools and failing community so that you'll be desperate for their government aid when they fail you when it comes to your education\nThey don't want you to\nDo amazing things in your life because if you do you have less need for the government which means you have less need for the Democratic party\n\nI I mean this is ... this is nothing but flat out racism\nWhen when when when you are a Democrat and you come out against ... and I said this earlier can you imagine if a white guy can you imagine if a black Republican would have said this about Colin Kaepernick when he started kneeling can you imagine what would have happened to the manager of a black\nRepublican would have said about colon cancer and make the same thing with the black Democrats said about Kanye West\nWas rapidly negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mentally pictures\nToken Democrats stand with them and take pictures can you imagine if a black Republican would have said that about ... this is what happens when ... when a negro doesn't read\nIf you think the Democratic party cares about you as an African American\nI Would say look at the last week if you think the Democratic party respects you as an African American I Would say look at the Democratic party\n\nDo yourself a favor just just go tell a democratically elected official you're thinking about voting for Republican just thinking about it posted up on social media posts on your timeline hey I'm an African American man or woman but I'm thinking about voting for Republicans in midterms and watch how fast\nYou're democratic friends will turn on you\nWatch how fast they will come after you watch how fast they will call you an Uncle Tom they won't encourage a a some sort of debate\nThey won't encourage\nA you to think you know to to to have an open discussion you will lose your blackness you will become a leopard in the African American democratic community you will be calm what they have done to Kanye West this week which is to take away one his blackness\nThen take away his intelligence and then take away his brain function to say he's mentally ill\nBecause what they're implying here\nIs that no real black man would ever support Donald Trump\nAnd unless they are mentally ill are saying that every Democrat that supports the president who's black every black man that supports Donald Trump you clearly are bipolar\nSleep deprived mentally insane mentally incompetent now I'll be clear about this when I was watching ... at the oval office I thought he was unique\nYou clearly were not watching a politician I also didn't think I was watching a crazy bipolar man that was sleep deprived I thought I was watching exactly what I expected from Kanye West a unique individual that likes to be unique\nWho's been embraced by the African American community since for the last almost Twenty years\nAnd then all of a sudden because he sits with Donald Trump [noise]\nHe's no longer a black man [noise] but we'll call them and negroes who doesn't read [noise]\nAnd you think the Democratic party cares about you as an African American one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three suicide event

poverty in\nFailing schools they need your kids to be under educated so they won't succeed on their own they need you to not have high employment rate so you're you and your family or your friends are still somewhat dependent on the government for your food\nFor your housing they need you to live in areas that are not fill with success but still with a lot of failures so that you'll need them more to survive\n\nAnd what Kanye West has gone through this week he hits the assault on his literally the his mental state the assaults on his education the assault on his blackness the he's an Uncle Tom he's being used by the president he's not a real black man stop playing is music on the radio\n\nHe's lost his mind\nIs proof\nThat the Democratic party will destroy any black person as fast\nAs they tried to score the destroyed Brett Kavanaugh when when when the when leaders and former elected officials in the Democratic party come out and say this about\nYou as ... because you met with the
