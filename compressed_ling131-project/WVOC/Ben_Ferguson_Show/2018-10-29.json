not stop this I mean you look at this billionaire or who ran all these ads saying we need to impeach Trump impeach Trump impeach Trump he now says that Trump that created the atmosphere for political violence saying it's it's really trumps fault people need to understand that this is actually all Trump's fault\nThe President Trump in response to this horrific shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue issued a sweeping condemnation of violence and anti Semitism um do you are you satisfied with how he's responded to this tragedy\nWell\nI think his response to the tragedy is was appropriate but there's something much bigger than that going on here which is the atmosphere that he's created and if the Republican Party has created in terms of political violence\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene but you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs and we see it in voter suppression\nWe see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning for more than that we see it in a president who doesn't ... who has been breaking the law systematically as a candidate as a business person and as a president\nSo a Republican would argue or you say that Tom but\nThere was a capital there was a shooting of a Republican

from harmful for\nOn Thursday a Medicare or a significant change to Medicare\nWhen it comes to prescription drug pricing\nHaving a drug based on the prices paid and\nOther advanced industrial countries is a huge change that's going to save money for a not only the government which means us the tax payers end for millions of Medicare beneficiaries\nSo it's going to be a campaign issue and I want you to know what is true and what is not true\nAnd why this could be so good for so many American joining me now to talk about that as a team of Burma should administering the for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I appreciate you coming on tonight this was a significant move by the White House to where we're drug prices for millions of Americans\nThat's exactly it and and let me just give you some background first so\nWe were released a report yesterday as well and it compared cost\nUh our prices for the most costly position administered drugs that are covered by Medicare part B and what it showed is that on average the United states is paying a hundred and eighty percent more and in some cases more than a four hundred percent more\nThan the international average so this means that the Medicare program and our beneficiaries are spending you know just a lot more than other countries have to pay for their drugs\nAnd I think that some of the issue with how the Medicare program is set up\nAnd the way we pay for drugs and party which is a physician administer drugs are drugs that you get in the doctor's office and the worst actually just a price taker there's absolutely no negotiation that goes on\nAnd we don't get discounts\nAnd also the way we're paying doctors for this as well is that there's a perverse incentive for doctors because they actually get paid more\nIf they are prescribing higher price drive and so what the president has said and he's been very committed to lowering drug prices and we've heard him talk about this and he's delivering on his promise and what we did is we put together a proposal and we want to hear comments on our proposal\nBut the idea here is to essentially phase in\nUh the prices that are being offered overseas and face those in for our Medicare beneficiaries to that over a five year period our prices would drop on average by thirty percent so this would be savings to the taxpayer about Seventeen point two billion dollars\nAnd for Medicare beneficiaries it would be about three point four billion dollars are gonna keep doctors whole we're just going to pay for drugs in a different way so that we take out that incentive\nUm to prescribe higher price drugs and we're just going to be paying them a flat rate essentially to administer these drugs but they are going to be kept whole this is not going to impact patient access to medications in any way but what it will do for patience is lower their prices\nYou know one of the questions I Know I'm going to get from people as well how was that the rest of the world is paying such a different price for these prescription drugs than we are and why did it take so long to to make this change\nYeah and that's some of the the the way the Medicare program is set up and this is why I get very concerned when I hear calls for Medicare for all because the reality is there are just problems in the in the Medicare program today\nAnd it's it's what is written into law and essentially what it says is that we're going to have the average sale price a six percent\nSo there's really no room for negotiation and because of that we're seeing prices go up and up um you know I can tell you from where I sit at my desk I'm staying price tags of almost a million dollars for some drugs that are coming out and so we that we can't afford it and the worst part about it is that\nUh people overseas and other developed countries um are paying much lower prices and so it's time uh that America\nBe paying for innovation and for the entire world and that the the rest of the world also a contributing to the cost of innovation and drug development and it's it's it's time that we stopped American being taken advantage of\nMy guess would be stream of Irma used administered for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services I've met so many people to hear the word change that get nervous they think grabbed to sign up for this drive to change something or is this going to be automatic for people on Medicaid\nIt is automatic for patients it should really be absolutely seamless are not going to feel any change except for when it comes time to open up their wallets and pay the bell and that's when they'll feel the difference there they don't need to sign up for anything there are most people are already paying their part B premiums\nAnd so what we hope to see happen is that they're going to see lower prices at the pharmacy counter and you know over time this could impact\nTheir premiums and they could see those go down as well but it doesn't take a than taking any active stat\n... this is a obviously huge information for so many millions of Americans are on Medicare and Medicaid services that deal with those things that's one of the president did this on Thursday if people want to get more information about this uh we're can they go to find out more\nThat's exactly it you can find more information at our ... dot Gov now Israel and you can also follow me on Twitter and that's at sea ...

Fox News from that city soldiers and sailors memorial home to the Steelers game on CBS\nTook him literally three seconds every started talking\nTo blame the president you know well he got it right but there's a bigger thing happening here which is the president United States of America this is what he's doing okay I I go back to what I said in that there's just proof of it right there you want to know what the midterms about everything is the presence\nAll that as a strategy the Democrats in the midterms you have a horrific anti Semitic shooting that takes place clearly the president loves people that are Jewish his own daughter a convert to Judaism his son in law is Jewish or his in laws are Jewish I mean this is a man that that is loves Jewish people but it's his fault they were just shooting\nIt's it's it's actually his fault this is a guy who divided the\nCountry and I'll say it again if you support the president nine states of America\nAnd you stand behind them and you're proud I Want you to share but now if you disagree with them I Want you to the angry faith you're watching us on Facebook Live\nAnd I want to get your phone calls from all over the country one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to the Patriot mode icon phone lines are open now that's not all the time had to say\nSo it it implies that well this is basically Donald Trump's fault that we have the shooting a synagogue and then listen to what he says\nAnd I think if you look across the political scene but you see is routine systematic lawlessness an attempt to break small D democratic norms\nIn pursuit of victory at all costs and we see it in voter suppression we see it in extreme gerrymandering we see it in the violent political rhetoric of course that people have been alluding to all morning\nI mean there's so many records you says lawlessness okay so the lowest in so many of the straight you have a president Donald Trump that wants to secure the border and doesn't want to care available to break into this country\nYou didn't say that the president's kidnapping these children is the words of Jim Carrey you didn't come out and say that this is the party of lawlessness searches actually advocating for law and order\nDonald Trump is advocating for law and order he's the law and order candidate\nHe's advocating for there to be structure in our laws he's advocating for there to be a people not voting illegally and illegal immigrants not signing up to vote in places like California illegally and able to vote in local elections when they're not even a citizen\nAnd you want to say this is an issue of lawlessness that this the president as advocating for lawlessness and when he does advocate for the last to be enforced like securing our border you didn't say that he's he's a big it is a race is\nHe's an evil person because he's not letting people break into this country you just said you didn't want lawlessness and then you advocate for lawlessness all week long by advocating for people coming into this country doing this in a ... and a way that this law last\n\nOne eight hundred for seven for nine seven three to you know I don't believe that the president at fault and I'll give you an example\nI don't think that because somebody sends bombs in the mail this week and and was a Trump supporter that that's the president's fault the same way that the Utah man that was charged for sending toxic letters to Trump and other administration officials I don't believe that it's the fault of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder\nBy the way this is what the media was not focused on this week so I'll tell you the story because there were only focus on somebody that was a Trump supporter sending pipe bombs and didn't explode thank goodness and they completely didn't talk about another man who did something very close to this\nAnd his political motivations because it didn't fit their narrative federal authorities\nSecurity the indictment on Thursday against the man accused of sending threatening letters to top U.S officials including a rice inter related threat to president Donald Trump\nThe Justice Department announced the indictment of seven counts against William ...

with us tonight if you just joined us we're chatting right now [noise]\nAbout Democrats coming after Donald Trump Jim Carrey now the actor\nThis weekend said that a Republican or Donald Trump is now kidnapping kids this the same people that are saying uh been we need to make sure\nWe need to make sure that we bring people together to unify the country then they go out and said Donald Trump is kidnapping children that sound like unification not so much\nDoesn't sound like unification Adel do as I say now is I Do Democrats want to blame Donald Trump for the crazy man that went out there and did horrible things this week by sending bombs that people\nBut they don't cover the undercover the liberal man who sent writes in to the present rice in to the FBI Director rice and to the secretary of defense\nDouble standard they didn't say well should we hold Democrats accountable for what was said nope won't say worried about that\nOne hundred forty seven for nine seven three to one hundred and four seven for nine seven three to let me go to Mike thanks for wedding Mike you're on the bench Ferguson show good to have you with us go ahead\nA yes regardless of response and regardless of a whole is an old saying a lot of what side\nI think the the the point that's telling a cause very clear is that if you answer correct it than that justifies whatever went out of there I think that is the wrong approach regardless of food saying it\nBut I Do agree on one thing is that forty five at the edge and a lot of people get fired up an art faking it\nThe on a thought or a you know just verbal thing and to\nWhat we're seeing I think needs to wreck the responsible what I Am saying is that we cannot deny the fact that words have power and they do translate\nTo action in some instances\nWhere you are here here's my thing why is it that no one has brought up the actual violence it's been done by Democrats when they surround I Am congressmen I end up fighting I Am\nNot well let me just let me ask you a quick question if you look at you if the Democrats are surrounded the table or the Senate majority leader and through his food out in the street in Kentucky you you look at them they surround the table if Ted Cruz get right up and Ted Cruz face screaming and him where he has to lead the restaurants around his wife\nOr you didn't see any of the Democrats are being forced to denounce that write the media wasn't in their faces go Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer you denounce the way the Republicans are being treated no\n'cause that's not a story they want to cover there is a double standard here I Would love for all of this to clean up I Would love for all of it but remember this is the same guy that's on TV saying in peach\nYou know in pizza president sign up with me and pizza president sign up with me I'm earning multimillion dollar adds impeached president because I don't like the president that is a big problem that's the part might that irritates me than\nI Am saying that you know regardless while we say things\nAnd they'll expect people to say you know that's just to find out why why why why not just because we have a a a reasonable explanation for answered correctly that it's not right I think I think\nThat is very offensive to the people and this is what we say that word yet I'll have a way of explaining and just\nLet me let me let me break it down let me break it down even more just blatantly All right I I'm assuming you're not a big fan of the president\nI I Am a big fan of justice at liberty or oh\nOkay All right and if you didn't answer my question is sort of it's not a trick question is asked you\nYou're not a big fan you're not if you're not a big fan of president right\nWell let me put it to you this way I Am a big fan of justice\nAnd he had the same thing I'll just said that's exactly the same thing you just said so I'm going to ask you a third time it is not a trick question I think the simple question have right now or you're not you're not a fan of the president right\nYou're not a fan of the president right\nI Can't see you want to justify as\nI Know I'm not justifying anything I'm just asking a question Mike if I had a trick question they\nCan go see at one point the finger man\nThat's what a finger I ask you a question the question was are you are are you not a fan of the president\nAnd how he says that\nOkay I'm going to move on because you're just I I mean I I I gave you a fair shot their answer a basic question it's not a tough question to answer my question I was going to ask you following up to that wasn't as we have an audio already the president responding to shooting at the Pentagon\nDo we what's what's play that because my question was going to ask you was is the tone of the president of the shooting at the synagogue not spot on exactly what you want from a president listen to Donald Trump\n[noise] like\n[noise]\nAgain the little\nThat if you take a look if they had protection inside [noise] as a result would have been far better\nThan will always exist I suspect but they\nHad [noise] some kind of a protection inside the temple\nMaybe you could have been very much different situations that\nHe was able to do things and unfortunately he shouldn't have been able to do I hear the police were outstanding hires at least at an incredible job it is you know\nNumerous police were badly injured [noise] but\nAgain law enforcement event has the job\n[noise] now I mean just just start with that right there they tried to turn this into an anti gun thing they literally tried to turn into a into gardening near the media is this\nAbout the gun laws it's about the gun laws we don't know anything about that we don't know anything about the gun laws\nIn
