{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And so you want to know how are they getting paid way in where's the money goes sometimes the mutual fund company makes the fees sometimes the brokerage makes us see sometimes the advisor makes iffy sometimes their manager and makes us human there's can be so many layers in there and it's not that you're saying you want someone to work for free for you you just want to understand what you're paying and is it reasonable\nAnd that's something that I don't think anyone can really argue with and so it's really all about just understanding what your options are in getting to the bottom of it and if someone tells you there are no fees or so you don't have to worry about that is just a red flag because\nEither again there's something being hidden or maybe they don't even know and those are kinds of things that you want to watch out for so one of the areas that we look at when we do at no cost new obligation retirement review in addition to all the other areas of your retirement planning but we can look up and do a fee analysis and take a look kind of under the hood\nAnd rather than just looking at a statement that just has an account value we can actually research that and see what kind of fees there are and believe me we've seen a wide range we've seen people paying enormous fees four or five percent a year management fees and some of their accounts and we've seen people that are also paying close to nothing\nSo it really there's an enormous range in our industry and so valuable to get that information so you can make educated decisions for yourself\nTo get started and take advantage of that new costs new obligation offer costs now eight oh three nine retire if you said at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars for retirement costs now it mentioned the savior retirement radio show to take advantage of that free offer once again it's a two or three nine retire\nPets derby is the founder of preservation specialists I'm generally jak along side in the studio if you miss that number it's eight oh three\nNine retire or eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three\nPat I think we are ready for the final item on your checklist were going through some ways to help determine if you're getting it sound appropriate\nFinancial advice for your transition into retirement ... what's the last item on the list\nYes didn't lucky number seven is a assessing whether you're currently on the right track financially for retirement this is something that sounds pretty basic but you know a lot of times especially if you're working with someone who's more of an accumulation advisor\nThat they're just thinking about how do I make this pile of assets as big as absolutely possible which again is valuable it's good to have someone doing that\nBut there's so much more right you need to figure out okay now that I'm accumulating whatever I've done over the last ten twenty thirty plus years\nHow do I turn that into a retirement plan\nAnd those are two wildly different things in the piece of the gym that I think is really important is you love to have a financial planner who gives you good news\nAnd I love being that if I had to laugh I Will tell you I Love sharing good news but sometimes the news is an ideal him actually working with a client were in the early stages of their planning\nAnd when we did their first analysis it was very challenging and I was not looking for the sharing that information because there was a big gap between what they wanted to accomplish and what the resources you have I give them all the credit in the world and I said you know you've done a lot of things well you're just trying to accomplish more than the resources you have\nAnd I said let's talk through that and they really took it so well now if we do want to retire earlier\nWhat changes do we make what do we do how do we look at our budget\nHow do we look at where we're spending our money do I want to work longer or do I want to retire in the work part time\nAnd so we start kind of walking through all the different possibilities and so it goes from what I was concerned about being kind of a negative conversation to really it was uplifting for me 'cause we're back to problem solving and helping them figure out how to accomplish as much of their goals as we could\nAnd you know pat I think I Want to play out before we get to the end of the show here for some people\nThey might need to change what they're doing now because they've been getting inappropriate advice but because they haven't been getting any advice at all maybe they've been trying to just get this on their own do things and sounds and they found themselves going down the wrong\nPath what do you think\nI think you're a hundred percent right and we have a lot of clients that come to us from other financial professionals but we have a lot of people that handle things themselves\nAnd it's really more of that you know something goes off in their mind maybe something happened to their life maybe they start seeing downsizing in their company or maybe with friends or maybe someone has a health issue\nAnd it's just that realization that okay\nIt maybe it's time to get serious about this and\nI Will tell you the gym a lot of times those people have done a great job of you know accumulating assets\nNow it's just about kind of taking that one piece that they've done a great job of in now fitting that into the rest of the plan some maybe they've done a great job of accumulating four one K. accounts investment portfolios maybe even pension benefits and the next day\nThey're kind of thinking about Social Security time they're thinking about their insurance but they don't really know how to put any of that together and so we can kind of come in and it's not necessarily that\nDone everything horribly wrong it's just that it's going from ... kind of a simple kind of that you know blinders on accumulation to having a real plan\nPat we're just about out of time on our show today do you have any final comments force or anything you'd like to leave our listeners with\nWell I think you know we talked about seven different things I think are really really valuable Joan and the other thing that I Would sum it up with is and people may think this is kind of a flip and response but this is again just seeing it over the years when you are trying to figure out who to work with\nHow to do your retirement planning if you want to go it alone if you want a professional and if you're shopping or you know meeting with different people\nOne of the things you always want to do is trust your God\nIf you have an opportunity to meet with someone once or twice\nThere should be a feeling there that they're conveying information to you that you want to know that you need to know if if I shall professional is pushing a product to you your gut is probably telling you well even if that product sounds good if they're not helping me understand my plan there's missing piece there right\nAnd we always tell anyone who comes into our office window we're not perfect for everybody sometimes we have someone come into our office who wants to be really really gross minded and aggressive with they're investing that's not really us you know what we want to do is to help you grow your money if we can\nWe really want to do is preserve it and make sure you that income coming off of it as well and finding that balance and so there is no one perfect advisor or a company for everybody so it's about really kind of doing your due diligence and then when you talk with somebody\nTrust your gut if you have a good feeling about how that process goes we have found that quite often that that just works out very very smoothly and that gender is the reason we offer\nOur retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation because we want you to have the opportunity\nTo sit down with one of our retirement planners and see if there's a a good connection there and see if you think that our skills and our expertise is a match for what you're looking for sort of take advantage again

beginning of this week\nBeaches one after another of closed it's considered a public health emergency it's a more serious red tide than normal according to Florida in\nA press reports it because ... trouble breathing and sinus infection simply being on the beach can affect you because the thing is as an airborne toxin which I didn't know that is getting in the water and touching

latest red tide is caught the attention of politicians and businesses were acutely aware that the tourist season for self words about the gear up\nYou know it's been tough down there I'm All right

with Birmingham CBC e oh John RS welcome to our own world trouble John\nHello Robert how are you where I Am well I have very well thanks very much hope you were doing well in Birmingham so we're going to ask you this you know Mary and I we travel a lot and we have for the twenty five years we've known each other but when I think of all the places we've been over the years Birmingham certainly near the top for us as a parent company and we also own syndicates the written by the show\nAnd we have for nearly Fifteen Years so there's so much about Birmingham that makes it a great place for travelers whether you're a history buff whether you enjoy great golf you know or other sports in outdoor activities like yours you the botanical garden or stay parked even medical tourism with your terrific doctors in the army has been so what are you most enjoyable Birmingham and its various communities John\nI just I think the one of the day or many of the things that are so unique about Birmingham and makes such a travel experience for for people is there's such\nA wealth of different things all types of\nPeople here on our website which is in Birmingham dot com we have about twenty different unique experience from everything shopping to outdoor activities girls weekends out I kind of rare is\nCourse golf so many different one of the unique opportunities experience here in in\nRegion you know you mentioned it earlier that the Birmingham is a area that many southern cities have undergone as you do great run of the last couple of decades and we are certainly not an exception but that we have\nExperienced so much\nThere's so much interest in our destination because of all the different\nUm I think that one of the things that work very very proud\nOf what we have merged as we've become one of the leading\nFood destination country a lot of people don't know that\nWhen we talk about that I don't remember and food and travel really go together and that's actually what I wanted you to touch on so take it away I tell everybody about this because we know we've had wonderful experiences in Birmingham is a\nWe'd like to call ourselves\nA dinner table this out and\nThe reason that we do that as we\nOver the last\nTen years we've had an emerging boots and that is just really really a basically a great experience for\nThat the uh we were just recently honored\nWith the Birmingham is the only city you can basically go to now this year and experience the best restaurant in America\nAre selected by the James Beard\nFoundation and at the high road or five points out in the area\nWe there's a great restaurant huge honor yeah it is John I Want to ask you this question on that note because we're limited a certain amount of time right now but you know for years we've seen considerable growth along the highway to waiting quarter but in recent years and ... you know with highland park as you mentioned that\nIt fits into this the downtown area has experienced great revitalization is the new ballpark there's a number of hotels you know he's got the civil rights museum the convention center and that's all hoping to kind of fuel your airport to grow so what do you think is the biggest enhanced to Birmingham for travelers in recent years\nI think that the the renaissance what happened down touted as the spirits it started with the development
