hands on within a couple of weeks or a month or something like that\nBecause it's very rare that someone would have a fifty or one hundred thousand dollar emergency right so that's our goal is really to help you keep the peace of mind but also if you've got a huge pile of money sitting in the bank making next to nothing\nHopefully we can squeeze a little more return of that and that's an example of just that comprehensive nature of the plane that we like to do we're not there to tell you what to do we're there to help you talk through it and find out\nHow can you benefit financially as much as possible without feeling uncomfortable giving you that peace of mind that comfort that's what we're trying to actually create with that financial plan\nAnd all of that starts in our first new costs new obligation retirement or view that's an opportunity to sit down with us look at where you're at right now most importantly look at what you want to do what do you want to accomplish what are your dreams what are your goals and then we want to help you figure out if you are right on track\nThe goal is ultimately that could potentially be your first step to building a custom built retirement plan that helps you see everything in order to make sure you're on your way to their retirement that you've always dreamed of\nTo get started call now at age ... three nine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement act now for your retirement review by calling a two or three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three it never hurts to get a second opinion on your retirement plan and if you don't have one yet it's never too late to get started\nSo call us now at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nTalking today with pets truly he's the founder of preservation specialists path then going over the most valuable assets\nYou had heading into retirement some of them are tangible some of them are very much what you think you are different retirement accounts maybe your real estate property is some of those are the things on your most valuable listed assets others are a little more intangible your health\nTime that you have ... what's the final item on our list of most valuable asset for retirement\nYet in the last one I have is advice and as I think about this one comes to my mind is Twenty one years of experience and how the night and day difference anyone listening right now think back to Nineteen Ninety seven so when I started okay\nSo if you had a question about finances it was really helpful to have an advisor that you could talk to because it was hard to get information that we're we're talking you know the early stages of the Internet we've got dial up you know maybe the dialects out on you and yeah you know you can't get through to AOL and all that stuff\nWill manner we spoiled now used to be you can just go to Google and now you can ask\nSyria relax or whatever you want to do to get these answers for you\nSo it's so different now Jan that it's really\nWe are in an age of information overload and you know if we talk about Social Security on the show today and you say well I'm going to Google which I think Social Security and you're gonna get literally millions of searches\nFirst of all who wants to read all that and who has time to and then also how do you know it's reputable so that's where we believe it's left just kind of giving information to you and now it's about building a trusted relationship it's about having somebody that you have a real relationship and that's why we love\nHelping you build a retirement plan and then helping you execute the plan\nAnd then make the appropriate adjustments over time and now you're a long term relationship with somebody who knows you who knows what you were looking to accomplish\nThat's where I think it can be such an enormous difference from what a financial advisor would do Twenty years ago in the last thing I'll mention about that kind of tie it back to where we started is the other idea with so much information you may be able to get that information but it could take notice about time\nAnd is that what you want to be doing is that when you think of your dream retirement is it okay now I'm going to block off Monday's spent all my time researching investments in the economy and interest rates and things like that\nFor someone who comes in and hires us the answer's definitely no they want to understand the plan they want to have a relationship with us and talk through things but then when they are outside of the officer not worrying about it and so they know what's in good hands and so those are a couple of thoughts I think could be valuable\nAnd I think that's important path to talk about the information overload that's out\nBecause as you said things are so different today than they were back in Nineteen Ninety seven the technology that's available today we had these programs now these robo advisers all these online investment platforms where we can really try to do this on our own but you're still\nSaying maybe that's not the best way to go right well I think\nJim the term robo adviser has become a huge topic in our industry where any time someone asked me if I'm worried about better fearful of it I say not in the least because there's not a single person that we work with\nThat is looking to replace us with a robot or we have a real relationship it's not some type of algorithms that has spread sheet\nNow I don't think that a robo adviser is necessarily the worst thing in the world if you're looking for something that's incredibly cheap and you know straight forward especially you know maybe when you're younger maybe a remote visor is a great thing\nBut if you're investing ten thousand dollars when you're in your thirties early forties\nThat's a very different scenario than maybe accumulating two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand a million dollars or more and you're about to retire maybe that's a time when you want to have a real relationship with someone who actually understands you and what you're trying to accomplish and then the other part I Would say is\nTying that investment plan to all this other areas and that's where I think ... the things we're trying to do are so different than what a robo adviser is\nPat you had any final comments for us today on most valuable asset for retirement\nVillage and there was a fun topic and I think like you mentioned there are very typical things on there like for one case in IRAs but there are things maybe you wouldn't have thought of and I think time an advice or two of those\nHow do we make the most of your time or we don't know how much we have and how do we make sure you're getting good advice from someone that you can trust and those are the things that we at preservation specialists are just passionate about\nTwenty one years in industry and getting to know our clients overtime and realizing just how valuable those relationships are we go through life cycles with our clients when a parent or a spouse passes away we're experiencing that with our clients and understanding you know what's happening in their lives\nIn when you're retiring when you have grandkids born all these types of things that are going on\nThese are huge things in our lives and the finances are probably not the most important thing but they're still important and we want to make sure they get to Europe properly all of that is about having a long term trusted relationship with a financial planner and those are the types of relationships we love having and we love building\nTo get started and see if we are a good fit for you give us a call now what you do three nine retire that'll lead you to an absolutely no cost new obligation retirement view to help you see where you are right now and see if you are right on track\nIf you said at least two hundred

in the world Scott McCartney as the middle seat column for the wall Street Journal is in front of the show and a frequent guest divide and a friend of mine delighted to have him on and he just flew the longest flight in the world easier to tell us about it Scott welcome to the show\nGreat to be with you Rudy alright what airline did you fly what can the aircraft and where did you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and this trip is from Newark to Singapore and saying that since coming back\nUm it's more than Ninety five hundred miles and uh basically um to the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus\nA three fifty dash nine hundred jet I'm this configured for ultra long flying uh they've Airbus has modified the fuel system they restricted the cargo load a little bit on it\nUh and uh and it can um uh they face a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is scheduled at Eighteen hours forty five minutes or ... when I did it we had some favorable wind so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplanes and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats uh you you wrote in your column that they're sixty seven business class eats a Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on online company with your column the seats are fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particular with the international airlines and and what we think of is economy plus or the extra leg room you get on the domestic us airlines premium economy on on on Singapore\nI'm In and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to what somebody into a small fee for Eighteen hours\nUm but the show this seat has an inch more ... than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches inside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches um and and about six extra inches of leg room\nYou get a little bit more recline and it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that dissimilar to what business class used to be long before the flatbed\nRevolution hum so it's you know it it was a comfortable seat on Singapore actually has um a specially designed that seat with features\nFor this particular flight it for ultra long flying um where there are extra supports for um for your cab as your legs things that will hum\nA reduced tension hum but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane and I know many people can\nSee and it was a flight ...\nWas I was full I mean it's interesting with the premium comedy feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of space or something before seats in the middle so you've got you know middle seats in the middle of the airplane\nAnd I think the people in that middle section in particular you know you know kind of trip where\nUh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific tips we only have about ... you have some sort of gets which is drink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right\nYeah I think that's really important really important for circulation really important for fatigue um it it it and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours particularly if you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking\nCoffee and tea and particularly herbal teas and and things and and we think of that is sort of a direct that you know wouldn't wouldn't maybe D hydrate you\nUm but in this case uh um the recommendation is a drink coffee and tea because it forces you to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is a good thing it gets you up and moving around on the other thing I think is really important and and this goes for really any flight but particularly long flights if if your contact lens or anything bring eye drops\nAnd bring a sailing nasal spray you have to do you can stay much healthier on an airplane if you keep your nostrils moist um the the mucus membranes up there that that trap infection\nAnd saw very little bottle with the when you spray it brings a little bit of drops stick 'em in the feedback pocket and and use them are really every time I get up and walk every two or three hours\nI appreciate that because I've never done that all good advice and you survive the trip obviously did round trip out and you're back home in Dallas
