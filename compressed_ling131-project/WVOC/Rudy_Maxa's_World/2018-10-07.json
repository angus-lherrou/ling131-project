{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And what we often do we will have kind of layers of flexibility and what I mean by that is instead of having a big pile of money in cash we still want your money working for you as much as possible so maybe we have a smaller amount of money in cash you know maybe you like to have an actual cash you know in a safe and you're home maybe a little bit in savings and checking at a local bank\nMaybe you have a little bit in an online banks have FDIC insured that's being a higher interest rate and then where can we go after that well if you have equity in your home we may want to consider a home equity line of credit that you can borrow against an emergency a reverse mortgage is a possibility you can have a a line of credit as a reverse mortgage that you would not have to make payments on\nAnd then the other thing is there are\nSome types of savings and investments that are not requiring you to tie up your money for a long time but maybe can offer a higher yields and so we try and do in this example Jen is helping you maintain as much flexibility is you need\nJust trying to squeeze more return out of that money and you know for some people that want to be conservative and leave a decent chunk of money in something you know very safe that can be pretty big difference as far as the returns so\nThat's just one example that I Would use as far as different areas of flexibility the other point that I Would make is you want different sucks points or flexibility potential based on the more significant decisions you're making your life so the date of your retirement or things like that certainly wouldn't have flexibility with those assets\nAnd usually you have that it might be when you make your pension decision it might be when you're deciding what to do with your four one K.\nSo those are all really important to have and it ties in beautiful Egypt and if you hire a retirement player to help you we love to do is start a relationship with you\nAnd then help you all the way through so if you've not retired yet help you figure out what that plan is supposed to look like and then help you all the way up to that transition into retirement and then through retirement as well and that's really the most gratifying thing for us because we get to see you living the retirement of your dreams we call the custom built retirement plan in the very first step\nTo putting that together is taking advantage of a no cost new obligation retirement review\nWhich you can get started by calling right now at age ... three\nNine retire we'll look at the big picture talk to you about your needs but really about your once in your goals and dreams for retirement and help you put together a plan if you said at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and mentioned the show to claim one of the ...\nThat we have reserved for today's listeners at eight o three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three\nYou're listening again he said your retirement with pets through the patch the founder of preservation specialists\nI'm generally jak alongside pat just gave me the phone number the website is retire with pat dot com\nIf you'd like to learn a little bit more today we are designing a blueprint for financial house looking at\nSome of the different components that need to be included so it will stand the test of time it is built to last wouldn't we include all of these different elements pat what is the final pillar or final components that we should make sure we include in our financial blueprint\nWell in a this is another one where I Am going to get on my little soap box is really the pillar of this kind of the mortar that holds all these various parts together and that is an actual comprehensive plan ... pull all this stuff together and we mean by that as it is a plan to consider what your goals and dreams and vision is for your retirement\nIt's going to consider your assets any deaths you might have could consider your income it's going to consider how to help protect you from all those different risks we've talked about earlier it's going to consider those different areas of investing we talked to her because you need growth but you also need preservation and you need income that's how retirement is so much different\nThan when you're investing when you're younger there's all those various facets to it and then once you have all of that put together now you have that plan you need to implement the plan and then you need to manage the plan\nSo that's where we think it's such a difference first of all if you just buy a retirement plan from someone you still need to implement it and then you need to manage it over time and then a lot of times a lot of people in our industry are just investment advisers and they may be very good at that\nBut it just doesn't make sense to us and that's why our clients love our structure because we are trying to pull it all together because your investments are incredibly related to your income in retirement which is very related to your taxes so that's why I Would say just having a comprehensive retirement plan is the eighth pillar\nSo it's not the best idea to build a home without the help of some sort of architect or contractor some sort of expert my final question for you today pat is what's your take on people trying to build a financial house for retirement on their own without some of that guidance you were just referring to\nWe all have different personalities we have people that come to us that have worked with other financial professionals we have a lot of people who haven't so they've kind of put their head down and said you know what I'm going to plow money in the four one K. and then I'm going to read up on retirement stuff maybe they come to one of her retirement classes and that's how we meet\nSo a lot of times they're just thinking okay it's time to get serious maybe I Need to talk to a professional\nWhereas someone else may have worked with a number of people over the years I Would say that it's not that it's impossible to do yourself but the question is you need to ask yourself are do you have the time to do all the research to understand all these various areas 'cause it's a lot more than investing sometimes you'll have interest in investing\nBut there's a lot more to it than that and the second piece is do you have the interest in is that really what you want to be doing in retirement that's probably the biggest change I've seen Jen in my career I found ten or Fifteen Years ago more people that are more interested in that you know going back to my career spans back to the day traders and people thought oh you know what I'll do I'll sit at a computer all day\nAnd I'll make a bunch of money you know you don't hear that any more but I Hope it didn't farewell from those people so I'm not of the school of thought that it's impossible however that's what I Would ask yourself is\nDo you have the time to devote to doing it right because you only get one chance at retirement and you better not mess it up\nAnd then number two is that how you want to be spending your retirement those are things you need to be asking yourself\nOf course we're a little biased because this is what we love to do are passionate about it we love building those long term relationships with our clients and kind of helping the them through retirement or if they're already retired just helping reduce their fears and stress and helping them kind of create that plan\nThat's going to do all those different things to find someone that is a true planner that comprehensive\nAnd its independent those are the pieces that can help you build that retirement plan of your dreams\nAnd ultimately what we're trying to do is help you sleep well at night and do the things in retirement that you want to do that is where we started this show and that's where we'll finish it find the things that your vision your goal and dreaming retirement and spend your time there that's why we do the retirement plans we create and that's why we offer the no cost new obligation retirement review to get started\nThe call right now is it with three nine retire or nine seven three eight four seven three if you've said at least two hundred and fifty thousand

the Boeing seven forty seven\n[noise] that's right ah September thirtieth was the fiftieth anniversary of the rollout of the seven forty seven which to this day if you ask me and and many other people is the most important the most influential jet liner in in history a deal introduced\nI didn't know introduce economies\nOf scale and then and that allowed for the first time large numbers of people to travel long distances ad affordable fares more than any other playing it changed the entire face or ...\nI didn't know that it was the first uh you know airplane with ... says I knew of course it was a double decker with that ... front knows but I didn't know it was the first ...\nIt was it was the first a wide bodied jets and and watch absolutely remarkable it it went from a literal drawing on the back of a napkin to an actual flying airplane and just a little bit over two years when I more than it was more than double the size\nOf any existing play and and built it from scratch and just a little over twenty four months at at eight and nowadays it takes five years just to design the variants of an existing play it I mean that was just incredible considering it at the the era and what what had happened the Nineteen sixties the late sixties\nAnd considering what I Know from having read your column and this this week it was twice the size of any existing passenger plane at the time which is extraordinary to be able to build it two years to\nTruly and and it's it's a beautiful plant and it ... it is a beautiful place I mean it's so much more elegant and then to a three eighty which is the plan that superseded it\nFinally in terms of size it's a you know I call it the Empire State building of airplanes it's not the biggest anymore it's not flashy is but it's still the most elegant and and the class he is\nAll right I Know another thing that's been on your mind is the overcrowding of airport lounges we're talking about the ones where you have to be a member or have a credit card that allows you in particular lines lounge and I've got to say I agree with you I mean ... airport lounges don't seem necessarily quiet highways anymore or they\nYeah and I don't understand why more travelers are are\nConcerned about as wide as more of a point of controversy here maybe it is and I just haven't picked up on it but you know maybe I sounds duty but I always thought of the the first\nOr the business class lounge as a place of some exclusivity of of luxury or even even extravagance to some level and yet you go into the lounges today and they're kind of a cross between a cafeteria at a daycare center\nThere nearly ... ... in part because it's so easy to get in if you have\nThis credit card and then this level you can come in and you can bring in some cases unlimited guests I mean it it's crazy to ... in in some lounges I've actually seen people standing at eating food out of place while they stand in a corner because there are no seats\nAnd on top of that you've got an issue with children being brought any laws and are very unruly baby's screaming kids running I was in ... and all I Want you to Amsterdam recently and there were kids running barefoot throwing themselves over the furniture\nI mean this is supposed to be the premium clash lounge setting the executive lounge we used to call it right\nYeah have you heard anything in in in in hanging around airports as you do and being in the airline business whether airline companies are concerned about this I Know they're trying to you know up to the food offerings and so on but are they talking about building bigger ones\n[noise] well what can be done I mean ... short of building all new and and much bigger lounges which in a lot of cases is a non starter I mean really the only way to deal with it is to restrict the passengers who can enter may be a\nYou know how to dive lounge it'd be only for first in business class passengers period or if you're going to let people in through third party perks or you know max and what a [noise]\nUm let that be the case only when I'm just at a certain capacity or less I'm Len maybe limit the number of gas that people can bring it but it's it's kind of out of control at this point and something needs to be\nIn the last Fifteen seconds we have left you want to anger parents everywhere by saying one of your wishes that kids under a
