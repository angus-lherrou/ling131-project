{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "And try and accumulate as much as I can well at some point when you start getting close to retirement you got to pull the blinders off you have to look at the big picture\nAnd that's where we're here to help you do and take all the things you've been working on you've been building\nWhich is so important and so valuable that you've been doing but let's take the four one K. is take the Social Security benefits let's look at the timing of when you want to retire and let's put all those pieces together and build a plan and the foundation of that plan is you're written retirement income plan if you don't have a written retirement income plan or if you haven't looked at a long time\nI Would urge you to give us a call right now at eight o three nine retire we offer you are absolutely no cost new obligation five step retirement review and part of that retirement review is taking a look at your retirement income plan or helping you build your first retirement income plan once again that number's eight oh three\nNine retire if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a tire a call now never for us to get a second opinion and if you don't have one yet it's never too late to get started calling out into three nine retire\nTalking today with hats derby he's the founder of preservation specialists than I'm generally jak alongside retire with\nPat dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more ... what\nIf we like part of our retirement intend to be guaranteed what should we be thinking of that for guaranteed income\nWell certainly I think everyone wants to at least part of it guaranteed rage and so we need to think about what's included in that category\nAnd think of it again as we're looking at your goals and figuring out what's going to cost to accomplish those goals now we're figuring out how we're going to generate the income to cover that so that's going to come from for most people Social Security\nFor some people a pension as well so both of those generally usually have some type of guarantee backing them and then the question is is that enough and for the vast majority of people the answer is no so there's a gap there right so how are we going to cover that gap\nAnd again for most people that's covered by their nest egg\nSo we want to encourage people if you think of the three worlds of money we don't want to cover that gap from the growth money's money in the stock market and mutual funds we want that to be kind of your long term growth money where we want to pull it from the other two areas which is the safe and guaranteed world or the steady income\nBut steady income isn't guaranteed so coming back to your question that leaves the safe guaranteed world\nAnd for most people the idea if there's a gap there and they want to have something guaranteed that's where ... can come in because you know there are a lot of different kinds of annuities but certain kinds of annuities can have tremendous guarantees built in and that can be incredibly valuable in the circumstance\nAnd we do have a little bit of time here before we get to the end of the show so why don't we talk a little bit more about the kinds of annuities and what we should be thinking about when it comes to perhaps using one and our retirement plan\nYeah so there's a lot of different kinds of annuities out there Jan and it often is considered you know kind of a taboo subject and I often hear there are a number of things in finance where someone might say well I've heard of that term and I know someone that got burned by it or I Know I've seen articles telling me it's a bad idea in ... he is a big one\nBecause there is a couple of different kinds of annuities that people have been burned older style annuities sometimes we're what we called irrevocably which means you put your money in and then you all of a sudden you'd lost total control\nAnd that's certainly not the kind of annuity that we would think is appealing today on the other hand there are types of annuities that have tremendous layers of fees in them and there are a lot of people that advertise against annuities these days and that's what they're referring to\nOur annuities that have one or two or three or four layers of fees that my costs three or four or five percent a year\nTo the investor certainly something with such layers of fees is not something that will be appealing so what we were talking about is an annuity and for most of our clients what they're looking for something that has some kind of safety of principle so they know they're not taking risk of there\nAnd then the main thing we're really usually looking for Jen is do we have the ability either now or down the road to turn on some kind of guaranteed lifetime income and you know you and I I Believe in the last segment we were talking about what if we live a really long time and the technical term we use for that does longevity risk\nSo if you we live a really long time how do we make sure we never run out of money well\nOf the few tools that protects you against that is an annuity that offers a guaranteed lifetime income so\nThe way that we use those if you think about a married couple we usually want to have an annuity if it's an appropriate fit for them and not all of our clients certainly used to do it is but if it's a fit for them\nWe went to allocate some money to that safe guaranteed basket of money and it's gonna be the new deal with the principal has a guarantee from the company and then at some point we can turn on income that's gonna be guaranteed for as long as both or at least one of those spouses is living\nAnd that can provide a tremendous amount of comfort knowing that you can't outlive that money\nAnd again ... you know a lot of times and media with people who were fifty five or sixty and you know we're running projections were looking out and you think about when you're eighty eighty five or Ninety and sometimes they'll gonna laugh and say you know that's the least of my worries right now\nWell that's okay but at least a your worries but my job is to make sure you never run out of money right so this isn't something that you are piling all of your money into but what it can be as a piece and that's where it can be an appealing\nOpportunity for you to kind of begin allocating in those three different worlds and having a lifetime income guaranteed to one piece can be very appealing for a lot of people\nApparently have just a couple of minutes left in our show today do you have any final comments you'd like to share with us as we start to wrap things up\nOh I think you know we were laughing a little bit in the beginning that wouldn't it be nice if we were trying to figure out when can I retire or how much is going to cost me to retire how much do I need to save for retirement just shake a metric eight ball and for it to give us a simple answer but of course life's never that easy is it we all loved to have it easy button on her desk but that's not the way it works\nSo I think this was a really valuable product to discuss today\nHelping you figure out the different steps involved and again we really need to make sure we know what you retirements going to look like what are your goals what are your dreams what's your lifestyle but it'd be\nAre you a home body are you in a world traveler\nDo you want to eat out every night do you want to spend your time volunteering for ... for charity course for many people it's a mixture of all those things but helping you figure out what their lifestyle is going to look like I mean that's a fun process to really think through\nThen that helps us figure out what that is going to cost and then we can kind of assess what your assets are to help you build that retirement and that's the whole idea is building you a written retirement income plan from the ground up it's personalized and customize specifically just for you\nAnd that can have tremendous power not only could help you retire successfully but it can give you tremendous peace of mind to know that you have a plan in place that you're on track towards accomplishing those goals so we don't\nAnd like that yet give us a call right now at age ... three nine retired we call her the custom built retirement plan because we are accustomed building it for each individual clients\nAnd what we're doing is offering that to you is a we call it five steps retirement review it absolutely no cost and no obligation to get started called ... three nine retire\nIf you said at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars for retirement call now and it was three nine retire this analysis is completely customized based on your circumstances\nThere's absolutely no obligation but this offers limited to losers of today's show once again that number's eight oh three nine retire\nYou've been listening to said your retirement with pat ... make sure you remember that number eight oh three nine seven three eighty four Seventy three or eight oh three nine retire the shore to tune\nIn next week for more

dumb incredible revolutionary history as well and they've combo tours they just kind of um we can take a call ... ghost stories which to get the seaport history\nAlready Giovanni I was looking on your website and I saw gallery so no this is from people that have taken to win or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen it goes to what you think might have been it goes\nOut absolutely I'm definitely seeing a ghost um yeah so\nWe uh well one of the house or the ... the most haunted house I'm In the city and that's where the corps

slept in my own building because sometimes you know I guess they overnight so\nI've never had anything happen then but I definitely have had stuff happen on like horse you\nThe part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were about to introduce you that\nYou know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coast is your sense and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south you've got plenty of so you can kind of hidden all their uh\nYou know I got a few questions right now for you to tell us do the tours run through all types of weather and how often do they run and do you and your team you know do you ever get that real fright or scare while you're out on the tours\nOh yeah we're on every day I'm through November fourth here and then uh that Ben daylight savings time happened and so we go to the weekend but um yeah you know the Boston sale employment combination is really a great combination people go to Boston and then they\nTake the train up here the train comes right through the city\nAnd I and I have the right and then they do fail until the spend a couple of days here Dubai can maybe go planet so it's a really great combination I mean our areas rich in history you know what part of one of the oldest part of the country so um but yeah so it's um it's it's a great combination all around\nWhen people come there for the tourists uh what do you find it what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you thought they would know they just don't\nI think one of the biggest things that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we tell them or stuff like Alexander Graham Bell lived here for three years\nAnd ah we had a very famous revolutionary I'll say a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord and it's actually the first confrontation\nOf the revolutionary war so\nThere's a lot of like stuff like that that wild with them and then we call them all the stuff and oh my God people are just blown away\nWe talk about ... and you know some of the little stories of the trials that are just so
