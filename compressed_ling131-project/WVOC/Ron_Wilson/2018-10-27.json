{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "Uh trying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with\nAll the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're drawing a traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural flow where to find the natural order of things\nAnd you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know\nA billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight or are we to do that and we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and\nWhat that what that really means who's gonna decide when robots\nHave really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface of sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day a\nArtificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating\nWill run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the ah the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ...\nYou write and artificial intelligence now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall e and I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... they're just putting it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seemed to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know\nTen thousand two hundred and twenty five so [noise] yeah and I\nThink the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is\nWas used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five but at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities and or the more they do\nIt was for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy uh yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the crazy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like

you mentioned the yesterday about the leaves what to do is to release falling generally respective 'cause I Know we talk about Mona back into the law which is very very important this is a different perspective on how important they are to allow the wildlife that's out there\nBut the one thing they don't mention and you know I talked to same article we I think yeah host of last year we talk about this great article and I agree with a hundred percent but it doesn't mention lawns\nYou don't want to leave the leaves on your lawn leaves everywhere else\nBut not on the lawn and that's the important thing but it's a really cool article about all the wildlife that enjoys leaves that have fallen over the winter time and it's amazing how many appreciate those but\nThere is a place for those and the grass is not the place yes but a good article very cool very cool and last week you were in Dublin, Ohio I was we were doing the national pumpkin weigh off of it and it was two weeks ago two weeks ago\nAnd uh that particular but you've got a picture of the winter up there\nAnd it was like a couple of pictures on yeah came in at Nineteen eighty eight I Believe wow I'm Out of ... in Michigan\nSo often go as a matter of fact if you've broken two thousand yeah he would have been the first person in the world to have for pumpkins that four way off over two thousand pounds ... so he was\nTwelve

producer does an outstanding job\nNow may I answer the phone just rang go\nAnswer the phone phone lines are open it eight hundred eight to three to five five anyway a headache or several emails this week\nAnd it always happens when we have someone on a we're talking about a book a good book that's out there uh well you know good couldn't catch the name of the author of the book where do I go find it or just a reminder for the folks that they couldn't remembers called garden renovation transforming your yard into the garden of your\nDreams and it's by Bobby Schwartz\nHer website is be G thumb or a Bee Gees thumb dot com as and Bobby's green thumb dot com and you could buy it on her website you can also buy that Amazon and places like that as well but again it was called garden renovation and this was a\nIt's a really cool book because what she does that's her specialty is a landscape designer\nGoes into homes that have existing landscapes and it's a tough thing to do I mean I was it was a diner designer for several years and going into a house it was brand new with a clean pallet\nWas so much easier than going into a house and heading existing landscape and trying to work with and I'm standing plans now you know you you would just easier\nUm but she likes to just the opposite she likes to go on with an existing landscape work with it and then try to achieve your goals I'm your designed the types of gardens that you'd like to have with the old landscape is already there and change things around and it's a really cool book says he has a lot of pictures I Wish she said I think only\nOf the almost three hundred pictures about ten of 'em are weren't hers and all the rest were but just she addresses literally everything in your yard sidewalks porches decks sheds\nFences screen plant things outdoor rooms she addresses the mall and great pictures and a great easy read but it's a it's a wonderful book and uh and that's why we had her on but again it's called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams\nHer website is be G thumb dot com eight hundred acre three eight to five five Gemini Ohio good morning\nWanting Ron How are you good sort of yourself\nOh too early to tell [laughter] early to tell what a what a good product to use a plane ticket if they bring indoors for the links are trying to keep the bugs out\nTwo things I look at I'm Glad you brought that up because it was a little tip we wanted to share today two things I look at it as far as protecting and one is I Try to do everything I can outside before I bring him inside and try to knock off as much as we can\nHosing them off with a strong Shima water really takes a lot of bugs off your plants and I'll typically do insecticide all soap\nAs they'll last pray before I bring it back inside now you can also do a systemic insecticide if you wish\nAnd you can do that before you bring it inside as well so it's you know it sprinkled into the soil water in so that's something you can do before you bring in and and when you go to your local garden center they all have a systemic ... insecticide specifically\nFormulated for indoor plants and then must say for indoor plants and that's out there a bond I'd has the right thing for them has a\nA N n insecticide all soap I think is your real key to I'm taking care of bugs once you get them inside the house to fold insecticide also so organic it's all natural so that's a good thing and the thing about insecticide all ... you got to remember it only kills what you spray it on\nSo if there's nobody there it doesn't kill anything so you have to you know if you see the brown break you get to insecticide all soap out your your spray everything it kills what you spray it on so between the all that systemic insecticide this up inside the plant and your insecticide also during the outside of the plant\nReally does a nice job keeping under control one last thing I suggest to gym\nFor smaller plants that are maybe eight inch pots are smaller if you can get them into the kitchen sink or a utility tub if about every three weeks or so you take those and turn them on their side and just really ransom off with lukewarm water\nAgain I go back to the spraying plants off when you're outside that knocks might soften it knocks aphids off it makes all locks a lotta things off and put some right down the drain\nWithout using any insects as ... as insecticides and also systemic insecticide in the soil insecticide also a me more oil's available some folks like to use that as well but I liked insecticide also\nAnd then renting them off every three or four or five weeks you do all that stuff you pretty well can keep it under control and I always keep a um\nOne or two things either an old shower curtain around because you could lay down on the floor put your plants in the middle of and spray 'em if you need to protect the floor you know also use those um pans that you use that you put on your car if you like draining the oil and that that looks like a huge cookie sheet\nReally work really nice to and then you put it on that you don't get it on anything else so those are my three things for keeping bugs under control\nOnce you get 'em in the house\nOr ... or if you're a ... a stump removed and how soon Kelly ... their successfully\nBut remember ball is a great time an outstanding time to be planting trees and shrubs evergreens roses grasses you know and perennials you can keep on going\nFall keeps on going until one December the twentieth or so we've still got a long way to go and if the weather's right and the soils workable you can still get out and plant now there are some things obviously\nI think the smaller the container like ground cover that was in ... I probably wouldn't do that we there's a point in October we kind of start backing off\nOn things that are in small pots and the reason is\nIf they don't get rooted in well there's a real good chance to get get freezing go through the freezing and thawing again he down to the ground not do so well 'cause we're right at the top of the soil surface so we'll start to back off a little bit on those and some plants that are on a really a hearty miss borderline for your area\nYou know the earlier you can get them in in the fall so they can start to get an established a little bit as far as rooting into better off you are I'm so a lot of times things that are really on a borderline Harding is um the later you get in the season the little bit more of a risk you take a possibly\nNot doing well over the winter and of course you're in the hands of Mother Nature depending on what the winters like\nSo those are a few exceptions to the rule and I put another one out there for you and that's some of the larger evergreens and not that we stop plant the images that if you are going to plan evergreens later in the season or any time really um which is one of the tips you want to keep pushing over the next six weeks or so\nYou gotta keep watering ... no matter what your plan to you've got to keep watering and I think that's one of the things we forget about one were planted in the fall\nUm is that we've got to keep watering these plants to make sure they have good moisture\nIn that immediate root ball immediate surrounding area and then the plant as well especially plants that are evergreen that keep their leaves and needles over the ...\nTheir time reason being is this deciduous plants that have the leaves a drop in the fall and then they drop and they basically they really do basically go dormant\nNow yes they'll still lose moisture out of this stems out of some of the buds occasionally but for the most part they released shut down\nAnd so you sometimes don't see I have a really tough winter uh we have a lot of one of those the case you don't see it so much in the deciduous plants like you do when the evergreens but with the evergreens needle and leave the evergreens as we go through the winter\nIf you have sunny days\nIf you have windy days to any day\nUm they're always losing moisture out of those needles or none of those leaves and if you don't have moisture in the ground to replace that what happens it starts to dig within itself so you start losing moisture in those leaves and needles\nAnd now it's it's they dry out so they start to dry out so then they go to the branches and they start brain trying to pull moisture in from the branches to supplement what's been lost out of those leaves and needles\nUm and then that's where you actually get into some branch damning winter damage because they start taking the moisture out of the branches as well but it had they been really you know the well water going into the to winter season and good moisture in the ground or ... in the immediate root ball 'cause remember\nIt's just the immediate root ball and a few new roots are put out over the fall so it's still a pretty tight root system\nIf they don't have more should there to take back up what happens and they they can't replace that and you wind up having brown needles leaves a drop off in the springtime and branches that can die out as well that's why it's so important to make sure\nYou'll hear me always kept talking about evergreens making sure those evergreens even established evergreens\nThat um if it's a dry fall you don't have good moisture in the ground even the established ones need to have that good more sure going in the winter so it's very very important and then and newly planted plants you've got to stick with it the good thing about the fall is the fact that temperatures are cooler [noise]\nWe typically get more natural rain falls but temperatures are cooler so when you do go out and really soak those plants\nThey're not as active as they were during the season right so they don't take up quite as much\nAnd with a cooler temperatures it doesn't drive as fast so last longer for you so you're not watering as often as you would during the summer but it is important to keep good more around those plants until we get close to the holiday season once you get there then you're back off\nI even suggest and Ron Ron with us are certified master certified or wrists uh same thing that if you plant a evergreens in the fall or late in the season um I Would even suggest once a month during January and February if it stays really dry\nAnd there's no moisture in the ground to take a five gallon bucket\nAnd you get a day above freezing take that five gallon bucket go out there and dumped within the root ball around and ... to make sure again at those evergreens have good moisture going through January and February if you do a live Christmas tree and you're gonna plant that you know right after Christmas which is a great thing to do\nYou've got to make sure you watered in well when you're planet and I'd be carrying that bucket of water out there once or twice in January February to make sure it's got good moisture in the ruble it's really really important\nSo when you're putting your tools away at the end of the season you know and I and I and I know a lot of folks are going to say well jeez I we've turned off our irrigation system already they've come and winter ice didn't bono wow what do we do 'cause lawn falls in the same category you you go into the fall and winter with a dry lawn you come out next spring not looking so good\nSo you know if you turn the irrigation system off I understand that because you've got to protected against freezing but you ... the last tool\nThat I put away the two last tools one is a shovel cause I'm Still planting and two is the garden hose\n'cause I Want to be able to get out there and water as needed right through the end of the year so those are the two last days you put away and by the way if you're going through freezing freezing nights warm days as we go to approach the holiday season makes sure you're\nTaking out a hose off of the bed take it off

number eight hundred eight to three to five five\nTalking about you already got an an article posted on our website this week and we posted last year as well and it's a great article somewhat are always talking about mowing the leaves back into the turf\nHow important that is and and a great way to use up a lot of the leaves in your own yard and I say use them up because there's other ways to use them without ever ever putting them in a bag and putting them out on the curb\nAnd moan and back into the turf has one great way to do it sometimes that can be a little scary what folks because you're ... back in the key is\nI'm finally ground leaves that's the key if you're more doesn't really grind them up or you can't go back a couple of times if necessary or you don't have a ... that really ... fine that's what you need and you can only do this with matured lawns you can't do what new lawns first year law I don't do this\nBut ah two years law all on our older no problem but again you know new putting those at least back into the ... very very important\nBut again somebody came and said you know well what about the wildlife and leave and leaves on the ground because there's a lot of wildlife and enjoy the leaves and their eggs exactly right as a matter of fact this articles what we had found about what to do with fall and leaves and I love the article\nBecause it says lead a lease for wildlife and it goes on talking about a different species of wildlife like salamanders in box turtles and toads intrusion earthworms not insects that really enjoy the leaf layer\nTo live in butterfly ma species over winters ... leaf litter I'm you know the all of that and of course the leaf litter breaking down and I agree a hundred percent I think it's outstanding and you're in their exactly right but my point is and this whole article\nAt the very very end says something about um if you live in a condo or homeowners association where you can't leave him land then you may need a break them up or ... back into the ... into the grass was fine or you know find or ...\nYou never want to leave leaves laying on your lawn if you want a lawn next praying you leave leave laying on your lawn is mothers out the lawn over the winter and you've got these barrier is come spring so take those leaves and put 'em in the most areas\nUnderneath the trees most beds places like that in the garden and let the wildlife enjoy them in those areas but on the turf you need to grind those up and put them back into the turf but the turkeys to be alone open and available for the sunlight and to be able to breathe\nAnd the whole nine yards over the winter time I got to be done so don't leave leaves laying on the turf\nWhich you can leave a million and other places for a while I like I said I totally agree with the article it other than the fact that you just don't want I mean you could leave them on your lawn if you want but I guarantee you you're not going to much of a lawn come next spring\nAnd that's my point so use them again great way to using compost them trench\nComposting pocket compost bins tumblers um you know there's lots of ways to use up the leaves in your yard and just naturally putting them out on the ground in ... in bed areas\nAnd around the base of your trees as the ... that's what they're all about that is my Mother Nature drops them in the fall the nutrients back into the soil or to ... still rooting for the winter time that's what it's all about um so I agree with that but for the turf I say get the leaves off or ... actually mode and back again\nAnd again if you're nervous about Munoz leaves\nMum early in the in the a leap drop time in the ... giant time maybe you collect those up or a moment and collect 'em up and use them elsewhere and then as it starts to slow down more back into the turf again I also heard someone say this past week that lead frosted a couple of times in our area this week was probably his last ... for the turf\nWrong you keep mowing the lawn keeps growing and it's going to slow\nDown big time because temperatures are slow down but you've got to keep mowing as you normally would and I'm only be a couple more times which you've got to do that until it stops growing you can't tell you don't need to mow anymore and then you're done but in the meantime if you've got leaves falling you're gonna keep mowing every week to keep the leaves under control\nAs they're falling in your yard\nGot to keep that up as well so don't you're not done yet mowing trust me in our area you still have a ways to go and you know further south definitely a little further way to go and up north you probably are starting to really slow down but still a ways to go so stick with it please\nI'd again if you haven't done that last that they're not last and the federal on yet you still have time to do that we're going to look at that last feeding in November\nUm I think I backed up all of that but I used to say um Thanksgiving and at the end it really does depend on the weather if he would warm up and and then launch continues to grow and stay green and your mode right up to Thanksgiving or we can wait that long to put down that final ... because typically it was we always looked at when the lawn finally stopped growing that's when we went in for that last\nA loan application\nBut sometimes you wait that long sometimes it's ah [noise] the weather changes and and it gets really cold you wonder how much are you know benefit was putting it down so I started looking at you know a couple of weeks in the November\nLooking at China long range forecast see what the weather's looking like where's the lawn at that point in any time like the second week or so you're good to go\nBut I Would you know again don't hesitate and if you don't have that bag of fertilizer or bags that it takes to to feed your law and the second time or if you haven't found it at all you can still do this and that since second third week of November go get it this weekend\nGo buy it this weekend so you've got it in the garage or in the garden shed so you've got it available so you can get out whenever the you know the couple more weeks get a good day get out and put that down it's very very important so many times we just kind of\nYeah I'll Wait and see you know wait and see in the next thing you know I'm In the holidays and I don't go to the garden center and I don't get the fertilizer and some places have put a lot of it away and so you know you just kind of skip it\nGo get your fertilizer this we can be ready to go for that final feeding when the time is right have it in the garage or in the garden shed waiting for you to go okay don't don't hesitate this is very very important I Can't stress that enough um how important it is to feed that lawn\nTwice in the fall very very important but if you haven't done it earlier I'm saying you could still do it in November that's better than nothing at All right and we'll get the doing whatever in the spring by the way or the other question came up about I'm\nBroadly if we killers in the grass we talked about you know October being a great months to do that so the question came up can I still spot treat weeds in my lawn absolutely\nLook at the at the a weed killers at work and cooler temperatures fertile homes weed free zone\nBon ... we beat her alter our two that work at forty five degrees so those are two broadly if we killers that are great to use on those early weeds in the springtime and the late weeds in the fall because they work at forty five degrees now if you've had a two or three good frost on talking good frost\nOn your broadly weeds in the lawn\nIt actually kind of slows down in the process of the week killer action it's nice to get it on their before we ever for us but we have had a couple of good for us and if that's the case you may see it not it take a little bit longer for it to work and you may not see it at all you say well everything kind of green going into the November it trust me is working\nBut it won't work as fast if it's been frosted but you still have time to do that\nSo you want to spot treat get out there Congress you have to work in between rainfall or whatever but if the weather is right get out there and you still have time to do some spot treating if you don't get to it will look at it next spring and we'll see what we have to do at that point to union Kentucky we go build good morning\nUh Charles I'm Sorry Charles good morning got a question for you sure I got to have a\nOne I heard you and get caught I caught the end of it about not next thing or a soul and far between\nA man that Gary and I talked about\nYeah that's been six months ago and I hadn't been able to get through the oh uh I don't really hear that yeah I Know I'm not supposed to do that\nThat was first though I was proceeding he yeah he used it as a top dressing in a bear area in his lawn and it's you know it works the grass came up right away but the problem is is such a light mix in all rooted in the top of that he couldn't keep it moist enough he wound up taking that out\nAnd then scratching that the party ... into the regular soil and ... is ceding it again but the point was don't use use that regular potty soil\nAs that Phil or on top because it's so often it does you know it's not like a regular topsoil and he used that kind of like a filler and a point where she can't do that now to mix it in with the soil or to mix them with the soil and a flower bed\nOutstanding matter of fact I'll take a few parts that I don't know what I'm going to do with next year I'll dumped that in the in a bed and just rake it in really well I like using that for that and it's a good organic matter that back to it\nBut that was a bill area in the in the lawn where he was actually see okay well I just\nCaught the end of it yeah that's what I was going to do is I had a ... big Macs have discovered makes then right and I thought maybe I shouldn't yeah ... ...\nI went to bed no problem mixing it in with the regular soil no problem but to use it as a filler problem\nOkay I got ... ... it's okay uh the rich can look up the graph yes\nUh I got to the trees after I don't know which one it is I've got a large piano\nLike you were talking about ... and I also have a two foot diameter a water May of ... and er about thirty feet apart at the ... that that get it down at the ah ... right\nSo you but you can't tell you can't tell which the surface roots are coming from\nNo uh I Would I put my money on the maple but a lot yeah\nMore than likely it is and and typically you know it's not the best thing in the world to remove those surface routes to cut one or two off is okay and I think the maple would tolerate and with no problem there and they're pretty good about that uh would tolerate that without much of an issue\nEven the piano good old mature when you had one route that was causing an issue I'm sure you could pull that off and it would probably not affect the the big oil because well but I'm with you the the maples one thing the oak as another\nYeah I've got to do that are actually three feet long and two inches in diameter that are out\nOn his ... yeah yeah I you know and again if you think if you think it's the ... I mean is three feet longer so and it's so far away from the tree [noise]\nWell it's it's close to the oath tree but I've seen maple trees\nI had a problem with that I was down and I was ... and I was down checking at a drain\nAnd like the guy I said you got rich and the drain we started up the steps and I heard an explosion [noise]\nI mean it was like a cannon going all\nFlip back down in the basement [noise]\nAnd I really\nLike it out of\nReally aren't that interested I got I got to take a break but I I'm I'm guessing that's probably from the maple [noise] um if you're not sure I'm a certified ours come out they can take a look at it but if it is I wouldn't have any problem taking that thing out of there\nThey do for you to five five you're in the garden was wrong with [noise]\nGardening questions wrong has the answer to add one eight hundred eight to three calls and your even the dark with raw Wilson [noise]\nThe unemployment rate is any forty high scary David if you like me you probably think gutters are very expensive well the big box places yeah\nNot so that was all states the most got ours they can put gutters on most houses for less than twelve hundred dollars\nMatter of fact you mentioned you're gonna be talking about um you get forty percent off on guns and gun or protection right now\nAll states the most gutters with a lifetime guarantee on got our protection their maintenance free oh Stacy most got our local yelled at half the price of the big pitch companies protect your home by cutting all states the most governors eight three three five gutter online all states the most gutter dot com\nIt's one of the most successful bridal events in the middle of the window for seven do when you went okay bridal expo Sunday January sixth of the Columbia metropolitan convention center put your business in front of hundreds of new clients and just one afternoon\nShowcase your services network with other wedding boroughs and most importantly book new business the window for seven W went okay bridal expose Sunday January six it's presented by American floral southern white catering and Colombia bridal associates\nSo reserve your space today at bright city shows dot com that's bright city shows dot com\nHighest Gary David from ... in South Carolina homes inland realty I told you for years have I ever decided to sell my home I'd be calling lands well my wife and I decided it was time and of course we call that you've heard Glenn Beck talk about Lance now I've heard so many great success stories and talked to so many people who've got their homes sold quickly for top dollar that we weren't concerned\nBut we weren't ready for what happened in our homes sold contracts fullest price in twenty four hours full list price\nLance ... and his team itself into homes and land reality this is what they do for everybody they do a day in day out they've been doing it for years local real truth you know the market they know how to price you're home get ready for sale and by the way so covered they'll sell your home at a price and the deadline you agree to it that doesn't happen Lance will buy it for cash\nNumber to call eight oh three four o seven thirty eight eighty three eight oh three four o seven three eight eight three the website ... dot com ...

with us on a Saturday morning\nLori Greiner stops by now from Lori Greiner all state is good to see you Laurie I'm Gary thank you for had an absolute a couple of things I thought we might chat about the day and number one because I I did this at our our old house we built a home\nOh some twenty some odd years ago and a couple of years after the fact ah we added a structure out back it was we had a pool so we kind of build a bit of a pool house or whatever\nI even think about the time but you know now hindsight being twenty twenty at all\nIf we had an issue with that or would that have automatically been covered by our homeowner's policy so I Want to talk about your addict structures on your property and and then we'll maybe talk about even upgrading uh\nYour your your property and what sorts of things do you need to know about when it comes to your homeowner's insurance let's start with you you add something of a bull houses shed or or or whatever\nIs there some limited as to what's covered and what's not\nSome great great question Gary and so many homeowners may not even think about asking that question\nThey just start getting excited about a building that beautiful pool house\nAre possibly a man's shed or is she shared in the back yard offer entertaining friends or family and they they think that maybe that's automatically covered and in most homeowners policies it's automatically covered up to a standard of ten percent\nTen percent is the standard\nAnd it's covered under the dwelling them out of ten percent\nSo let's just say you've got a hundred thousand dollar home ten percent of that\nShed would be ten thousand dollars so you would automatically have ten thousand dollars worth of coverage\nOf you know more than ten grand into it it's all cover that ten thousand it would be covered for twenty grand into aware negativity\nRight if you ... we have a bad storm and you put thirty thousand which wouldn't be impossible yeah uh with all of our beautiful televisions in an amazing you\nAlways have a dwelling what about the ... what about the stuff you put out there\nWell the content would be covered it would extend from the home but there's so many things that you can do within that she shed\nA personalizing it and putting in all kind of a custom as a nation within that you would certainly want to make sure that you had enough coverage\nOn that would be what what did it cost to build that ... that's what you and your agent would want to discuss how much did it cost to build that structure and if it were taken out by tornado our fire\nWhat would it cost to rebuild it\nAnd I know there's always asked folks like you this question or there's never a a a universal answer but\nLet's just say using the example you had you hit a hundred thousand dollar a homeowner's policy on your home you you build something out back to that was well gosh twenty thousand dollars so you need to wrap up your coverage by ten grand to cover it a\nB ... which do you expect to have to pay for that additional covered\nIt it's amazing how inexpensive it is to raise that others trucks sure an additional ten thousand dollar scary as so inexpensive so I I Would think that adding an additional ten thousand\nFor other structure so you would have a hundred thousand dollars on the Wally ... an additional twenty thousand for other structures I bet it would be less than Fifteen dollars a year oh well that\nVery inexpensive okay\nSo you but if you if you you did this years ago and you've had to sit down back now for ten Fifteen Years and you're wondering ... wonder if this you should go your legs are ...\nWe had that conversation with your agent um and I want to go back to that what's covered if it were a tornado or a fire what about neighbors tree\nYes we we've had so many trees that have fallen across that fence that have damage or your your property let's talk about that he shed and what if it's a dead tree\nNow we need to notify that neighbor if you see that that's a dead train notify them and notify them and writing because if that tree is on your neighbors' property and it is dead\nAs they are liable for the damage that it costs to your fence and your shed right hideous said a live tree\nOn your neighbors' property then you are responsible for the damage that it's called ... yes why the difference um well it's an insurance thing I'm not [laughter] and wait to be here for hours is gassing of that\nBut um I don't make the rules I just sell the policy and try to explain the coverage is to my customers\nA live tree in your neighbor's yard falls on your property and damages that comes from your homeowner's protest and ...\nIs that as you're you are being protected under your homeowner's policy but in the event that the tree is dead or on your neighbors' property a you need to make sure that they are aware that the tree is dead huh and it falls on your property\nWhat if you never even thought about you had no idea there was a big tree and you didn't really notice what was your neighbor's yard but it was big enough to fall over and damage something on your property in let's say for example of you sort of came out ... often now you don't know\nWell that if they if it's damaged our property you're going to know the claims adjuster the weather was dead or alive [laughter]\nWell they're going to know if if the claims adjuster is aware\nOr from your side of the of your insurance company and their insurance company and somebody's going to be aware that tree\nWhether it's dead or alive they're going to make sure in the event of a tree been\nDamaged on somebody's property that's the one thing that the claims adjuster it's going to look at if whether that trade is dead or alive today and I'll get trees or it's a huge liability especially if you have children playing in your backyard and the neighbors got a dead tree in their yard\nThat's something that so important to make sure that your neighbors aware or vice versa ... you better make sure that that trade comes down and it comes down quick because you are liable\nOkay [noise] we talk about adding a structure what about if you're doing some upgrades to your home um mostly get to some renovations being done whatever your turned out all your your renovating a rumor or whatever the case regarding what brand new countertops from\nSuch a great job yeah they do a ... is there is this automatically no matter what you do how much you pay let's say you're you're putting thirty thousand dollars in your home and renovations\nCertainly willing to take pictures reach out to your insurance agency and make sure that they are aware that you've done in a great\nUh and it's amazing sometimes when we are listening to upgrade and we've got documentation from the contractor it actually reduces the price of your home owners premium what yes it does it reduces the price the maintenance that you are doing to your home\nUm reduces the price
