Khan post over the years and I basically just had three wouldn't dancer kind of open on the front and the cop a\nBut they do their job pretty good they're in a halfway sunny location but my question remains a is one or one of the band is kind of done can tell it it's it's totally ready to go I don't always you need to use it I got the other to advance caught a\nCook and I notice that have been that's\nAlready completed hiking as soon as I could keep strengthening shrank shrink and my question is should I put that in ... that you're back to keep it\nSo I don't know if the weather and the rain every move this keeps ... minute end of this soil that's already underneath it\nWell it does that and there's still could decomposing okay\nSo it continues to break down so never stops so it's always bringing down so like if you had that pile there eventually it goes all the way down until there's nothing left and it's the decomposing pretty much worked its way into the soil\nOkay so I can get that into into some kind of bag or bucket\nWell but even in the bag or bucket it's still going to decompose so you you know yes you know that that way we should keep it in the bucket but it's still it's still going to shrink down a little bit I think the thing to remember is you know that's what we're that if you look out you know an old free falls down and you have to stop playing there the tree trunk laying there eventually\nAs a decompose is it all goes away and you don't see it anymore it's down in the soil and and and what you're saying if you have raised planter beds and you do a\nSixty Seventy percent topsoil and in forty thirty percent organic matter\nAs that breakdowns topsoil those bands always shrink in volume and you always have to come back and keep doing them up because that's the organic matter is it breaks down so\nSo yeah if you want to put them in something uh you know like a bucket your bags or something like that would would be fine absolutely\nLike a back after this break down it didn't really like motor or anything like that\nWell it could if it doesn't can't breathe well you know he put it in the ... and you can't breathe well as a matter of fact sometimes you look at Baghdad compost they'll punch of couples in there just to allow it to breathe a little bit otherwise that guy and I'm old and actually get a little bit nasty and there's sometimes\nYeah I guess you're right that that 'cause it gets going into the soil that's already laying on right now so it's just the job\nAnd like you said is there anything in there yeah is it rains or the wind blows the course obviously that's kind of leach in and out of there to\n... well good yeah great what can you do store years in anything or is it do you just use it up\nAnd try to try to use it up as you need it and of course as you get in the fall season you know top dressing soil amendments you know adding to the garden or whatever you know this is a great time per soil amendments and all that and that's where composting really comes in handy this you know you're you're ready to go compost this time of the year\n... well I don't really have like a garden but I Do have some I think a couple a annual bad things go crazy and there but I guess I could uh aren't going around on my pushes him that kinda stuff when I was a top\nDressing use it as a mulch a you know when and if your if your neighbors aren't using compost and you seem to have a little bit of extra a list of gold and most people would would you know pay to get that kind of compost\nYeah entertainment and now your new business one last\nQuestion I I can get a coffee and a\nUm you really can't put too much ... obviously I'm not a it's not to protect coffee or anything but a cause that they've got a good amendment\nOver ... you know what coffee grounds ah can really fire up a compost pile I think you know coffee grounds can be added anywhere but put them in the compost and they compost pile that stuff is so great to help fire that compost pile up it's it's crazy so yeah use them and there can you over use it\n[noise] I Would say there is a point we probably could have a little bit too much but I don't I Would take a lot to get to that point\nOut here and there are a great show and our cats you say\nI did good talking to you a merry go by and we're going to Virginia and talk with and good morning\n[noise] how long it will for you as possible yellow jacket issues\nI think [noise] ... killer land um [noise] it's like four feet in an arched roof area of the ... for about four feet up that door mhm isn't taken the arch and its\nCircular it's about to ensure that we've never seen anything go in and out if we didn't see it the failed and chat for why strike and a cold shape\nWell they can be but there are the ones that do that that smaller round shape as well now you don't see anything coming in and out of the ... at this stage\nWe at\nUm you know just to ... you know thinking of it is once you start getting into cold weather you get a good frost or whatever that starts to knock all of them out and eventually of course that thing is going to decompose over the wintertime it's time to get the spring for the most part let's just really heavily protected will break down to fall apart\nSo I stopped in the winter or would I could I be able to lock down\nAs soon as you get into you know thirty degree temperatures for a week or so you got it made the the other thing you look at it as you know if you if you can hit it with that foam forming was foam I Do that hit it with a phone give it about two or three days if you don't see any activities and I knock it down\nOnce you put a lot more ... more through um a couple of times it's amazing how\nHow's the weather like down with put them in the trash can I take your your a string tremor which your safety glasses on your goggles on everything and then use that like a blender\nDo that so I'm I've never done that before that's a good idea of them all up and then dumped them into the capitals have fun with her head on with the early exactly\nAnd people say trees are too dangerous they don't want big trees around their house well I mean yes trees can become dangerous over time but if you have a car and you never maintain it it will become dangerous too and so you know a tree has so many benefits associated with it\nTake care of it I mean habit inspected have the have any potential problems identified and and so many things that were scared of with trees those risks can be mitigated\nWe treat her as regulators way of ways of printing trees reducing Fifteen Percent reduction in the ... and the canopy of a tree of the size of the can be a trade selective pruning and we're making small printing cuts not ... because a lot of the problems\nBut just as selective reduction can yield of us thirty to even fifty percent reduction in the when the forces of wind upon that tree plus it's centralized as the weight over the trunk\nAnd just makes a tree much less susceptible to wind damage um plus you know obviously removing the the dead wood and things like that right so you know that's another thing that yes it is it scares people but it it can be managed and it doesn't have to be scary\nIt's only scary if you ignore it\nAnd kind of pretend it isn't something that has to be\nTaken care of another objection here fairly commonly as tree roots you know get into the sewer lines and things at the end yes that can happen\nBut there are there are chemicals you can find a a hardware stores are punting supply stores that can kill roots that are going into into sewer lines sewer lines can be routed out by a plumber also there are silver lining in those uh they had that runs sometimes on local radio\n... see a mind of gas to watch them do it many times\nAs a gardener plumbing company in Cincinnati that does it as well right and I've talked to him extensively and you don't have to tear up your ... your landscaping or yard or anything they'll just line it from the inside of the house\nYou know I look at I look and run at two things one is the is the uh the pipe is one issue and then of course foundations cracking and in the trees get blamed for those ... and if you think about it one is him if the tree was improperly placed in the situation we're going to talk about that in our next hour you know positioning the trees but secondly\nOne is ... ... when it comes to foundations typically the treat him cause a problem though it may have taken moisture out of the soil\nAnd cause the soil back off of the foundation which may cause it to crack which may have been caused water to run through the cracks and then the roots may go after moisture that's what they do right but the treated and caused that and they get blamed for that all the time it really wasn't their fault secondly on the pipes if there is no leads in the fight\nSo that there's no water coming out of their house to treat others even want to going through their right so if the pipes gotta cracker or break or a leak\nObviously than any plan whether it's a tree or whatever it may be it's going to go to moisture that's what a naturally does its searches war moisture survival so they get blamed for these problems when really\nIt was a ... they they did cause a ... you know bottom line was they got into the ... bottom line was they may have gotten into the ... but they didn't cause it something else cause a problem\nYeah and and even if you you run into that it is a problem that can be addressed right you know I I'm Still waiting for somebody to show me the ... the route that pushed in a ... a foundation wall our son had a\nI'm not saying it never happens and it's very rare yeah you know ... it gets blame you hear the blame a lot but it's it's very rare it when your way all the\nProblems which are all manageable against against all the benefits of trees a it it's it's it's a shame that we did we get rid of trees or we don't plant trees or we get scared of trees or when those problems are really manageable on their address civil\nUsa ... when ... was your I think the last time somebody emailed me leaders of one of the points that she made was outstanding were 'cause we were talking about\nAll you know the CEO to and all that and what the trees do one thing was brought up of course was also helping to as far as ... or natural habitats you know for for insects and and critters in all the new and what they do for that alone you know what that is worse to our environment you know being a house for all of those things\nI have a colleague down in North Carolina is one of the leading a historic tree preservation is in the in the world really and he's a big ... big selling point of what he does and in ... preservation is the fact that you do have hollow areas and things like that and if the tree is responding properly to a to a hollowed out area\nAnd there's good worldwide formation that hollowed

I think that's the other mystery a lot of those labeled too yeah I mean rather places\nRather than kind of looking at the full scope and considering the options fully I think a lot of people will just look at what their neighbors got say oh I like that I wanted you know but there's so many trees out there that that you can perhaps hatchery isn't the best treat for you [noise]\nUm it's all about location it's about your soil it's about your moisture [noise]\nUm [noise] and the space that you've got you know and what trees are available\nAnd the you know the the resource that this and saying botanical gardens who has a plant places website we have that link from our website at Arbor Dr dot com\nWhere you know you can actually see pictures of these trees and landscapes mature sizes what they're going to look like I can name trees all day long but when you can actually look at him\nAnd see what they look like one big mistake I see a lot as with river birch is for example because I think what happened this for years people plan and white birch as they find them right up against HER Foundation practically they die before they got big and bold enough to become a huge problem because they don't do well in a hotter climate all the time\nAnd then people came back and say well let's replace it with a river birch what's gets forty or fifty feet tall and wide and they plan that five to St plays a part of the white\nBirch Eighteen Inches off the off the foundation exactly you know ... ... you can't do that well you can oh you can but you should do anything it was an idol back\nTo and I get I get this all the time and that throws the people I my biggest first thing is\nThink about the mature size of the tree nuts height so much because you are the sky's the limit the width of the tree look it up and see if it's a twenty if it gets twenty or thirty feet in diameter or give it another ten feet\nAnd then calculate that away from your house or away from the property line or whatever it may be so we we don't do that we plant that autumn leaves maple six feet in from the property line for is that going to be eventually\nI'm shaking your neighbor's house as well or we planted Fifteen feet from a er ten feet from the house where's it going to be gone down the road\nRound when I bought my house in Burlington I had a noise Bruce to footprints on dates with other quarter about passed out a lot of the house are saying it was cut the tree to what you cut it down it was twenty foot it was already ... brought in front of the house up\nGot one one one infrastructure thing that people don't think about is is how wide the trunks going to get in and say well it's a it's a four foot tree log on to an assault walk on the street and it's gonna be a three foot diameter tree so there's plenty of room for it but the actual equation that you should he is\nIs it the rich flare 'cause it flares out or the root system is going to be about three times what the trunk size and so it's going to be a two foot tree you really need\nAt least six feet of a a space there are for that route flare war it's going to start pushing sidewalks up and things like that I\nPersonally think and I think I brought this up the last show we had that you should not be allowed to plant street trees in an area that's less than six to eight feet from the sidewalk to the street\nYeah\nThere's always get that three and four foot gap you know and then you know is it ain't gonna work it just doesn't work and plus that tree is right up again you go now use ... an example now some of those ... and some of the trees are starting to get some size to them they look like this like a tunnel where the the trucks go through in sheer off all of the branches because they're planted\nTwo and a half feet off of the street off the curb I don't I you know if we're going to the other side of sidewalk would've been a different story\nAnd one thing I've seen him do in some of the suburban areas still have an eight foot median or something down the middle but I guess it looks cute architecturally to have him stagger though what the the first trade has pointed to fate or one foot from the curb on one side and that's on the one foot from the company as I said they're not ... leaving any room for that flare whatsoever\nHe likes to use those as yeah close you can get to them and you're going to even as he was laying curbs on both sides [laughter] see how we get close you can\nOr the other big problem we see is a poor planting so too deep way too high and then of course then we add on to that by to feed them ... multiple he knows so those are my big pet peeves I drive around town seeing that sort of thing\nThat's the one of the year ... irritates me the most because you know there's never been any perfect\nUh what do they call those ... things he's been on it\nYou know they look like wheels we'll achieve maybe a stand up comedy routine Sanjay cheesy to me that [laughter] they tend to rolling\nDown a hill and the whales I think in these all these ... a British people are running along with it and falling and getting run over and\nEuropeans do strange things with who they throw tomatoes each other's\nThroat heritage aggregate Hans [laughter] yeah there's all kinds of weird things they do put\nBerets and their parents yeah have you heard that one no I yeah it's crazy yeah they see how they can stand it wow before they ... they get it out\nTalking about the train goes Chris stone run Rob just got to be on line from St really a couple of quick\nThings here and work and they were going to fly through the next segment with ah with our chopped choices which is coming up so if you want to hear what the all three of them had to choose for their large shade trees medium ornamental trees in her favorite tree get your pen and paper ready\nTo do that after the top of the hour a couple of things real quick evergreen situation out there right now serious situation larger evergreens struggling you know ... ruin our I\nMean I mean it's taken over from the white pipeline are doing better than others you know what ... what are you guys see and what are you recommending\nIf white pine are properly sided I I I I Love white pine mhm but you can't just stick it in a heavy clay soil and Burma new subdivision\nAnd expecting a girl's back then to grow but I mean it's a forest tree so it needs to good soil it needs\nA decomposing organic matter it it probably does better in ... when it has some other trees around it with a slightly cooler micro climate\nI mean that's where it grows in nature and I still like that but the blue springs situation every other call I get as for declining are dying blue springs yeah it's a it's an environmental I mean the trees native to the higher elevations in the Rockies that doesn't get a hundred degrees up there Ninety degrees up there much vent thirty eight Ninety degree days of summer\nA and needle cast disease a fungal diseases is really\nHitting them hard so you know I I I Can't recommend blue springs anymore and Norway spruce which has some problems seems to be doing a lot better\nI think it's hanging in there yeah when I see for the most part are coming back at Norway's Bruce again\nIt already is Britain's All right as long as you water them and those really bad drought years if you're a granddaughter\n... true of all evergreens whether it's already or whatever maybe yeah you got to water on India who does it rain\nA such a hit and what was it two thousand seven or yes they did a night they probably have to\nLose Bruce into the region were killed by that summer loaded and the rest were dressed to the point where they died the following a couple of years\nTo find the white pine it's it's not white pines not destroy was such a this planet I buy your entrance\nTo Korea Korea and yeah or the\nThere's also the um it's a ... van der ... pyramid\nWell yeah that that's not a flexible as I'm not going to the end of ... ... ... yeah but I thought it was like a white pine that says the was showing me\n... straws strip of four of them several whatever this uniform us yeah after like by yeah the west away pies doing quite well that was pretty good yeah yeah it's not that white pine but it's pretty hilarious similar and uh yeah it seems to be handling yeah poor sites for us really well\nBut if you want to replace for blues bruises Colorado was Bruce I hear bill fountain my former president UK screaming at me it's not blues Bruce Christ it's Colorado spruce\nAh is ah the Orioles Bruce if you talk to the guys you know Brian Hynes over spring Grover a date Grassley they're going to say well and that was seven drought you know they lost probably a hundred Norris bruised and it was like three or ... I was\nGetting out of our dream was Orientals a sailor do long time to get on the side we'll try and sell them to somebody nicely planted plant is very expensive\nAnd Eddie's I should narrow ... selling a lot that a lot of people are looking for it's hard\nTo find and a lot of people want a larger trade when they plan it and you know it's a it's almost impossible to find in my in my experience in a larger size\nBut it does it excellent in landscapes and other things interesting about it is it does really well in shade mhm so I mean if you if you need a evergreen for a shady situation that does really well in that situation to her as your other versus Norway and\nNorway doesn't do as well and blue springs doesn't do it was well anywhere so\nMaybe we can increase the market need that we've talked about this morning with the oriental yeah I think it's a beautiful ...\nSpring grove is even though it's slow ... you know the it's slow when it's younger uh they pointed out down there and it seems like a catches up over time you know in size it just starts out Suslow which makes it a challenge\nTo grow frustrating for nurseries to grow that because it it you know you can get a ... a blues Bruce to market size and three or four years probably and an oriental spruce you may have to double that\nOf course we are seeing spring grove and green giant ... yes very fast growing really coming into the market big time now yeah and then there's another one I just\nSaw it was called sport stays will just a little bit smaller or\nA new in the introduction out there for you but again I think we are seeing that really starting to I mean we can't grow enough of either one of\nThe we used to be careful not to plant too much of one thing I'm trying to make sure planting up with the various things ...\nSpeaking of which diversity ... important a plant diversity in ... oh yeah ...\nYeah 'cause I mean people are people they have all ash trees and lost all the trees with them or ... or you know the maple trees out in and the Bethel area where the ... with Asian longhorn beetle has been a problem lose all their maple trees out there so yeah I mean if if you put all your eggs in one basket you could be losing everything\nYou might have any pairs New York's that'd be\nDecided Harry one I got cut down pretty quickly well that's two trees you cut down pretty quickly mhm\nOh I got more than that when I bought that house\nI had an repairs and all\nThe good three gone bad actors do a you know we were\nJust to save botanical gardens zoo [noise]\nWe have so many different plans for manuals divides to radios trees shrubs everything [noise]\nAh thirty five hundred different sessions you know [noise]\nUm that diversity is made it so that\nWe don't see past issues\n... comes along [noise]\nRun of the bill passed issues\nBecause of the diversity of the playoffs yes very very important quickly come back we'll start talking about their favorite choices depends on your paper ready\nFor this favorite trees coming up next with the tree and he goes to the garden was run Wilson [noise]\nMade it easier with your personal yard boy he handed a guardian and he's a rod and Wilson [noise]\nAnything better in [noise] get a crystal clear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters in service didn't maintained by crystal pulls a lousy when you're ready to make a splash you can trust crystal\nPools Elsie with all your ... you want to spend time enjoying not cleaning your pool trust crystal pools L.

I guess you do all that the gun eyes the finals fiberglass poles absolutely that those are the three main styles right there what are the advantages or disadvantages for those I mean when somebody's trying to make a decision on which one to go with\nThe each have certain things within them to the kind of setting them apart and and make them unique um with with your fiberglass poles or the the ease of use and the the ease of upkeep after the sale\nIs his second to none really ... with ... you'll have to change our shoreline or every seven to ten years or so yeah I'm with gun I there may be a little bit of extra work in terms of\nA brushing reply offering fiberglass are pretty pretty standard um wave Ghanaian however though you get is an endless array of of sizes and shapes because it's it's free for if you want it to like Mickey Mouse you can't ... it's it's a concrete shell that we\nDetermined the shape size on would you\nUh if you want to put benches in there if you want to make a beach in trade or you just kind of swallowed we walk in and you know it looks like something that has been there his whole life or you can certainly do that too so each one has as great teachers and and options\nUm but it's it's nice to be able to offer all three of those um so that whatever decision you make a you you've got some good options their night\nIt's a pita airline pool and spa as you can again once the phone number ...\n... three three seven three\nTwo to three eight oh that'll get you over to our store and we can certainly help you here um with with whatever you need in terms of construction or service after the sale uh for for me to have an existing swimming pool we've got a fully staffed and train service department they can do repairs do upgrades whether you want to go with energy efficient\nPumps and filters um if you want to maybe swap over to a saltwater pool\n... okay of course the website nobody remembers numbers anymore right the website Pete ale wind pool dot com that's us beat a wine pools dot com A.

very much for I mean I'm I'm doing great\nGood to see it or we are talking of course we we I talk all the time I Colombia's morning news about about your company and uh but what uh what what you provide for folks a a a great investment gutters and okay a gutters aren't sexy All right let's just say that right now they're not sexy\nBut the amount of money that you can save down the road um because without proper gutter and\nThis is one of the reasons why we have such a huge problem in our state when it comes to foundation repair issues\nThat is correct water is by far your number one cause of your foundation issues\nAnd we all know that but you know they do wonder why we've got such a big issue I when I first met you I had no I I had never heard this before that forty seven states in this country by law I tell you or your house has to have proper government\nThat is correct certificate of occupancy is actually what they call it so when a builder remote alert goes and does the work gets ready to sell the house\nThey obtain a certificate of occupancy um and that certificate boxes the obviously the inspectors come out they check off yeah you got a good roof yeah you got a electrical yet you got good pressure on your plumbing and in most states they go oh you don't have gutters you don't have a certificate of occupancy\nBut sadly us here in South Carolina you can get a certificate of occupancy without a single piece of God or on your house\nYou personally I'm not a huge fan of the nanny state but boy in a in is is like this\nThat's pretty big deal right they're very big uh and I I guess if you if you're looking for a home right now this is one thing to look at the are there are there do they have gutters and we have to differentiate Doug between gutters and proper ...\nYeah [noise] yeah so um\nProper gathering I guess the the term there would be one obviously gutter that's doing his job which is getting all the water away from your foundation so if you only have a little piece on the front porch because you don't like getting wet when you leave the house\nUm that's not necessarily proper gathering because the rest of your house and the rest of your foundation is getting pounded by water um another term for proper gathering would be properly installed gathering um we we see all the time\nGot her company's installing gutters and they've got reversed pitch on it which means the water doesn't even run towards the downs about to get the water out of the gutter so that seems like\nJust a no brainer it it's it's it's a it's just a lack of sometimes management and sometimes just letting those guys go out there and just to solve however they want and not not really thinking about the process that they're installing\n[noise] um we actually use the precision install a we use a combination of of ah levels and lasers to actually make sure that we have a quarter inch drop every ten feet so on a forty foot run you should actually have about a full into drop a ... we were\nTalking about from if you're looking at the home safe from the left side to the right side or vice versa I mean there should be that drop as it goes across you should\nStart seeing a little bit of that Fisher revealed the farther it gets to the uh down spouse and you actually have we've actually had some customers that go well this doesn't look right or a they'll say this as it's supposed to be lean like that and absolutely I mean pitches everything and if you don't have proper pitch on it it's not going to get that water out of that system and away from your house fast enough\nI never thought about that but it's it's gotta run towards the ... it has to well\nOtherwise it just fills up and goes right over the edge and you might as well not even have the gutters on your has\nExactly let me ask you this is Doug Doug turnout from all stay seamless gutter joining us this morning on the home improvement show the midlands here on WB Yossi\nFor somebody already has gutters are endlessly there they have proper government his own way around the house it's diverting that water and all that but maybe they're getting old and you're wondering I Wonder if they're still doing the job what are some of the warning signs to look for that would tell you it's time to upgrade or replace what you currently have\nA great question a said one of the very first signs that you can tell that your gutters are not functioning a functioning properly is if you look at the face of the year got her and you see black streaks um usually starts at the down spout works its way back um\nBut you'll start seeing more and more of those black streaks with those black streets are actually are is the gutters actually filling up overflowing and you're seeing the die from the shingle grit is creating those stripes on the front of your gutters so if you see black stripes or stripes on your gutter than Ninety percent chance your overflowing\nUm cause of that could be a couple of things one they're clogged they have some to breed and it's not allowing all that water to get out of that got her system as fast as it came\nTo the down spouse clogged it's got debris in it or it's been filled up or has stuff that's grown in it and it's not allow that water to get out or three like we just talked about improper a drainage if it's if it has ... doesn't have good slope or it's got reversed slope then obviously it's going to overflow every time it rains\nMy is there a a an easy way because this is one of these things you always see people up on a ladder cleaning out gutters uh\nIs is there a best way to do that I mean is there a tried and true method is a homeowner that you can get those things like that without putting life and limb and everything else at risk\nIf they have the um the only way and the only true ways to make sure your gutters stay completely clean and we actually have a better protection product it's lifetime product with a surgical grain stainless steel mesh over top of an aluminum substrate\nThat allows every bit of the rain to go into your system but won't even let shingle grit into the gutters uh when it rains that actually watches it off the off the front\n[noise] um [noise]\nThe absolute proper way to make sure those gutters never clog is gutter protection and a better protection product at work which is what we have 'em and by keeping those perfectly clean and all the ... only taking water then they'll\nAlways work properly for the life of the system\nRight now I Know you told me amongst back when I first met you that ah these days you're going to run across some good or companies who will not sell you just a plain old guard without the protection that\nIs true um I don't want to get into names but there's a couple of companies out there that have\nPatented a product that it's a one piece system where the gutter and the hood of the gutter actually come out a machine it's extracted it's one piece system so if you already have gutters in your house they're going to tell you have to tear those down and put their system up [noise] um what they don't tell you is their their their method in their um\nTheir invention is well over Thirty years old now I'm so it's all technology it's based off of water cohesion where the water comes in wraps around the front comes it comes back into the gutter and sends debris off the front\nIn a lab environment in a perfect environment it does work absolutely perfect um until you start throwing an obscene amount of water like big rain storms that we get here [noise]\nUm they also tell you you're supposed to clean the surface of those on a regular basis get up there and clean the surface otherwise the water cohesion does it work and then uh so you're back to where you started and then they clog up and they let the brie and they let shingle great in they'll let the pines drawing and pine straw was definitely the biggest\nProblem we have in this area with trying to keep your gutters clean because it's a beast\nLet's say for somebody that has got to rain right now and they've they've got down to about this blocked um and the thing about everything else is okay it was actually the clear this thing and I know\nLike for for told us for example you get that that ruder thing that you can turn around and go way up in the end of the you know the toilet I'm a pipe is is there anything like that for down spouses gutters to get stuff out of there\nNot really um when we go to clean up down spouse um a lot of times we'll use high pressure high pressure water um well actually use some ram rods and things like that if it's really tough at the top are bottom\nUm but most most of the time you actually have to take the return offhand that down spout off and actually get it completely cleaned out I mean if it's really bad I've seen I've seen trees and roots that have filled down spouse and we haven't even been able to clean them out just had to put a new details about up so it really is I really just depends on how bad it is\nSpeaking of the downs balance because you see this all the time I got gutters and the big rainstorm you looked at it you see that water coming out of that down spelled the problem is that ... is sitting there or maybe a couple of inches from the foundation of your house from the the base of your home or that could be a problem right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "city": "Columbia", "day": "06"}
