jeopardize our dominance in space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nYou know they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nOr appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\n[noise] censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way or they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like

alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course the show he um the brutal slaying of of a cause Shelby\nUm and how that might mean there is there a dominoes at play here obviously\nAnd wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed ah with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of this do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nUh but if you've been watching Mohammed bin psalm psalm and you know the

uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so we can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because are typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are all lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you

um you know they will run into the arms of putting input and understand that ah or into the arms of chi and to a certain degree that's\nI mean I'm you know we have to recognize the dark side of the

folks are getting ready to put greenery back inside the house over the wintertime\nI mean all the research has been out there shows what the great things that it does but now they're starting to you know look at gardening indoors and all the hydroponic garden and kids in those indoor kiss remember the old um\nWhat was that we always try to get that little um yeah that little yeah I Know a ... era garden arrow guard yeah yeah we never get them so that's one of those and then I could do things like that really becoming popular at growing your own micro greens and things like that indoors so bringing the outdoors back indoors\nAnd what's the what's that is really becoming what's that a plant or that kind of looks like a tree it's kind of like an Arab garden but it's really big\nUm in their pockets on his yeah yeah it looks hydroponic garden yeah yeah you go to this insane botanical garden in zoo and it's over by the children's part of the botanical garden in zoo mhm in one of the houses you see like this huge hydroponic garden that kind of looks like a tree right but you could tell that it's one of those those planters\nVertical gardening and that's that's hot also living walls vertical gardening um as a matter of fact you'll see it starting to show up more and more like an airport lobbies and things like that with all these big open spaces to do all these hydroponic garden is all the green houses now looking the vertical hydroponic garden so that that takes up less space grow a lot more\nUm for the the technology today the ... you know in that aspect has just changed so much for novel very cool yeah there really is very cool very exciting to have been a guest today on the show I guess let's say yeah we do as a matter of fact of a body shorts will join us this morning she has a book out\nThat's about garden renovation so if you're looking to renovate your old landscape or renovate a garden or start a new garden\nShe's a landscape designer it's been

it's a nobody's somebody they used to work here Durango kid maybe that's the guy frosty boots somebody that used to work here though\nHis name again\nUh yeah so the other over the phone lines are open right now a plane of the week\nWe've been talking about the trees we had the tree and he goes on a couple of weeks ago and all the plant list\nAnother series of trees that were pretty much spoken well spoken for with all the whole group there is the Freeman I series of hybrid maples it's a cross between Silver's and read the hybrid it's a hybrid and it came out the first one came out autumn boys many years ago was urban three of the year\nAnd since then I've been married very many uh selections come out after that but it's all the Freeman's selections I've got I think I gave you three or four up those you can take a look at but they are hybrid maples and they'll give you a little bit quicker a of a shade tree but still gives you the great a\nHardwood and the look of the red maple and the fall colors of the red maple but a little quicker as far as growth habit of the silver maple so it's just been outstanding or a hybrid or we liked him a lot there used a lot you'll find them and most of all the nurseries out there but it's the Freeman I series of the hybrid maples\nAnd you can check out some of the series that there are some of the different the selections on our website ... dot com\nVery very very cool and a lot of money you need a tree I Do in your ... your ...\nHow about just a U.S is uh how about just like a little tree and we can bring inside like a tropical areas I Want to bring the outside inside I Wonder how your trend setter yeah we always have been so ... what would what would you suggest\nIs easy plea well other than as easy plant because I was one of the people that actually killed as easy plant affiliate fig no you did I did do you when you gave me a couple of years ago you did yeah you'd never told me that yeah I killed busy plant how'd you do that you either over watered it\nOr was that regard or never water to ever water to a well that happens so yeah I forgot where yeah I forgot your water it now why did forget where yeah I forget where I put it it was right in front of my face\nSo yeah I was a plan and killed it ... and\nI'm On the shortlist appealed happen anymore though won't happen no heck no God no heck no Jennifer's got that under control yeah ringing men\nAre left it left a couple of minutes here to thank everyone for the birthday wishes from last week happy birthday to I actually had more people said that they listen to you

Georgetown about is a boost Bruce let me ask you this Chris over the years the new grows now just a new growth on the ends still the same linked to that's always been still putting out a lot of new gross\nYeah but they're hard on the air got it right there are completely bear and then we'd get up to the Arab ... you know it's got like out there\nRight [noise] couple of things can happen you know nutrient deficiency is the first falls remember this evergreens lose their needles on the inside it's a natural thing that they do and if you look at times for instance look at the white pine they only have needles from\nLouis years growth sometimes last year but that's it and they lose everything to the inside\nThe good thing about spruce trees for the most part is if they don't keep their needles about three or four years back\nSo they look for all the way back into the to the plant itself\nSo a lot of times you know you don't notice that but occasionally they will lose those needles all the way out to the new growth it's typically not a good thing it's usually a sign that for some reason whatever may be the plant may be under some kind of stress it could be um [noise] could be dealing with um\nMight issues ah which can cause the Beatles to kind of model and then they drop off early\nUm you know those types of things can happen if the new growth looks good very flush very good coming out good that's a good sign that means in the tree is you know it is is doing okay it's just that for some reason you're losing those inter needles now\nWhat'd you may want to do is\nTake some of the ... any needles that are still left on some of those branches to the inside take some of those off and take 'em to a local garden center unless somebody look at the needles themselves sometimes they can detect whether it's a might issue maybe a nutrient deficiency whatever it may be\nBut that's a possibility now if you get into individual branch is\nStarting to die on the plants which we are seeing on blue spruce now it's a it's an needle disease and causes those ... the whole branch to fall off or turned brown and then eventually you know you wind up having to cut it off I Hope you don't get into that\nBut that's going around out there right now so\nYou know it's several things but the the bottom line is is\nWe've got to take a look at some of those old needles to take a look and try to determine what's causing those to drop so if you can get samples to somebody to let them look at them that's going to be your best bet and take a couple of pictures of the blues cruise overall up close you know look at the new growth overall picture and and take those needles so local garden center\nLeft somebody look at that for you to try to determine what may be going on are you able to water those when you're in a dry situation\nWell you know we've got a train that share a I have a ...\nYeah ... yeah I get that the one that right that is what I'm going to\nGo up there yeah fake over your other caller the other one that was always a quarter to put our then right\nInto you know you have inspected inspected trunk make sure you don't see anything on the trunk\nUm other than that I Can't you know without seeing the trio itself I can give you any other suggestions or without seeing it and that's going to be the bottom line trying to get an I look at those needles and trying to figure out what's going on how much new growth has put out and and go from there how tall are they just said Fifteen twenty feet\nYeah they are ever going to ...\nUh if if nobody can come up with an answer just showing the needles you may want to invest\nIn a fee to have a ... come to the site and take a look at a mess with them you know that's an investment you want to make sure you don't lose and that may be the best thing for you to get somebody out there right on the site to take a look at um determine what else may be done to help switch back around again\nYeah hey don't\nWell I Would ... no I didn't say anything about beetles I said look at the trunk for any other issues that may be out there but mites\nCould be an issue could be under saying could be a which can cause some of those in her needles to drop off more so than others\nUm if the plants under stress it'll drop those needles more so than others like I say they naturally shed those anyway but for some reason that one's doing it more than the other one\nWhich means that there's something else going on with the tree might issue ... disease issue stretches you whatever may be but somebody's going to take a look at those old needles and try to determine what that may be\nYeah I probably won't get all made up the craft or you're all wrong it just\nLook around that you look around the base of maybe you can pick up some around the base\nMaybe you can even sacrifice one of the small tips of the branch who has the still has the needles on it\nOr that you could take along with you as well so am I could take a look at that too but somebody's got to see something to try to determine but again they naturally shed those leave those needles anyway but typically not that to the tip not the spruce\nAnd that just some reasons for some reason it's been stressed might disease drought heat whenever may be\nA but that's caused it to do that more than than it normally should do that\nIf either of fertilizer trees what what I Do\nUm you know you get ... you could use a Ross route feeder that would inject is a water soluble fertilizer into the to root system\nYou could even take something and drill holes around the drip line of the tree and and the poor little ten ten ten or twelve twelve twelve and they're very lightly and those holes the kind of feed that way you could even top dress underneath the the us Bruce for that but again that's not necessarily the answer\nYou know it's a disease or whatever that's the first thing you want to go after the you know otherwise a tree maybe doing great\nWith a new growth and had plenty of nutrients\nAnd not need to be fed we need to find out what the other reasons are\nOkay okay All right well that's what I Do think it\nAll right Chris and if you do find that let me know because I certainly like to hear back from ... to see what the what finds out but again\nRemember in this time of the year you'll see evergreen starting to shed needles on the inside it's natural that happens and boy sometimes pies can scare the heck out of you because they lose everything right up to this year's growth or can and when they do that especially white pine Austrian playing with those longer needles they get that gold and yellow\nAnd you know you're in an all those needles or yellow on the inside Arbor vibe these turned yellow on the inside um the spruce turning you know you know that scares the heck out of when you see that but realizing that they do this naturally and as long as this to the inside and not to the tips\nUsually pretty good shape but on spruce when it comes all the way the is like that when you say they usually keep three or four years grow so you don't notice as much on the root cause they lose needles way back on the inside\nUm you know what are they going to do you're going to drown them out\nSo that would\nThat would be another option for you and I would do it while it's still dark\nBecause they're not acting when it's dark and you know you get that hose and slip it up so you get it up to the to the whole get back and turn that on as you know and let it fill that hole up and that's where that's a good step in the right direction right there\nAnd then hopefully once it goes down you'll be able to take a look see where you are and and take it from there if you're you know otherwise if you're hesitant you call the tournament in the exterminators haven't come out and take a look at somebody else deal with it for you\nYeah well if if that was mine today I'd be I'd be out there this morning before it gets daylight and get I get a hose right next to it and and feel that thing of of water and that way that way you\nThey I mean what are they going to do that you know they can come through the water obviously but once that's filled with water now you've got you've got them a barrier there without water you're going to drown what's in the ground and you're going to stop anything else and going back in because they're not going to go through the water\nWell that sounds like a good idea that a shot\nBut being very careful yeah it'd be very very careful as it's unfortunate thing but you know we haven't had enough cold weather yet to take care of any of that stuff so unfortunately they are still very active but yeah when you can't see the whole you can't tell where the nest is a that's a dangerous situation\nOkay ah but if you're going to have a buggy go I later I'd appreciate it could bring it up to and will it will look they don't have that\nWill bring it up the I'm also an ... and see what he says I'm but I but I like I say that I think the phones are one of the best things to go after any of those because it really is a nice knocked down and secondly that that water maybe your issue you know you can you can go out there you could give you a hose in spray Eric connected with some\nUh seven something like that and spray the area again that do it while it was dark\nUm what's his daylight you know you're now you're facing may you are\nNow that's a good idea that that that'll give me broad coverage because they were I mean they were hovering ten Fifteen square foot area all over the place yep\nYep and if you do that and he'll get on the other the hose and that way you get that wide spray a ... that's a possibility for you also I I think my first step I'd be on a thing of the water but that would that that's my opinion should just be careful and we will bring it up the bug is you\nKnow alright alright thank you\nAll right John good luck with it and again those are things you don't want to mess with but\nUm where I've had you had to deal with it I still think those phones and they'll shoot Fifteen or twenty feet if you can see the opening if you can see the whole um that you know that you can spray with that really does work nicely I've gone where they've been in a light post lamppost in Philadelphia that foam\nWith that stuff just it is terrific but again very dangerous if you're allergic to that or you know you don't want to take a chance to call the exterminators that's what they are all about\nFlip them take the chance to get stung not you so keep that in mind pleased would be very very careful anytime you're dealing with things like that\nUm but seven ... V. I. N. or very usually very toxic to bees are ... and ... so that is a as a general spray could be a possibility for years well I'm dusting a whole sometimes where you know the whole is\nYou can flag and dust around it with something like seven or around the top so they take them take it back in with them that's a possibility for you um but um again be very very\nCautious water can be your you know you real good friends for driving them out so I Would keep that when it might as well we're going to take a break here at the top of the hour when we come back we've got phone lines open for you an eight hundred and eighty three to five five lost a tip she shares with you as well and then coming up at the bottom of the hour [noise] you know every now and then we come across a good book\nA that's a great information for you and I found another one it's actually written by a good friend of mine is called garden renovation and it's a book about transforming your yard and your garden into the garden of your dreams\nAnd you know if you've got an existing law in maybe an old landscape you know you've always wanted to change that patio around or redo the the foundation planting or create that that a\nSpecial garden or patio area or bringing the indoors outdoors um but not sure which way to go you know we've got the existing landscape now how do I have to renovate that not only change it around not sure which way to go this book helps to walk you through tells you what they used to think about what to consider\nAnd of course Bobby and it's written by Bobby Schwartz has taken pictures of all of the lawn and garden renovations\nShe's done over the years to show you what she has done yeah now they made the changes over the years\nAnd it's a great example for you to look at the great ideas and again get that process of what to walk through a measure looking to uh to renovate and redo areas in your in your uh your whether it be the from your bag you or whatever it may be\nBut against called garden renovation by Bobby ... and she will join us at the bottom of the hour or so I'm a ... be sure stay tuned for that got about a minute to go then\nLet me go ... we're going to go to a beach in South\nCarolina Good morning I'm going to go to ...\nJak itches five gallon bucket white man but a couple of jobs that book it up those got dumped in turn [noise]\nFeel that sucker up and they come\nSo your your use of water\nA couple of drops and white a white man right couple drops showed sticks to them it sticks to write it if you get the water level for right now\nI haven't had a yellow jackets come back to that in a while and we get sinkholes down south Carolina\nSure so so again vinegar couple addresses so hold a lot of in a lot of white powder garden hose soak it well they won't come back\nCome back I guarantee PG great tip or they just are\nBeat from Kentucky got one for say hang on the will come back we'll talk to about the history for getting rid of order to get a phone lines are open for you it's eight hundred eight to three to five five don't forget our website rod Wilson online dot com\nPlants of the week Halloween popcorn balls bringing the outdoors indoors because the great tips including a couple of weeks muggy July bugs as well it's all happening here in the garden with Ron Wilson\nMaybe with your personal yard boy he's gardening and he's a rod and Wilson [noise]\n\n[noise] the crystal clear splash that was the sound of someone enjoying the crystal blue waters in service to maintained by crystal pools L.

of the our bodies Schwartz is going to join us this morning got a brand new book out there called garden renovation\nIf you've got an existing law in our landscape patio area I'm In your maybe moved into a home that has an existing and you want it it's just not you or maybe it's older or you want to change in her updated renovated\nHow do you go about that with an existing lawn landscape you have to tear everything out and start all over\nCan use what's there what's the process what Bob has gone through that she's been doing this for years and years and years and finally broke down and wrote a book about it and shares or pictures under stories and her ideas as far as how to work through that we're going to talk with Bob are you out that this morning\nAnd again that talked about her new book called garden renovation coming up at the bottom of the hour or websites run Wilson online dot com be sure and check it out our planet of the week this week I you know we had the tree and he goes on here about three weeks ago we talked about trees\nOf course fall such a great time for planting especially when it comes to planting trees\nIf you haven't planted a tree remember trees are the answer\nYou know if there's one thing you could do out there to help save the environment to helping improve the environment to help save mother or it's you know the one thing and there's lots of things we need to be doing but that one thing that the biggest effect and that would be the Planetree or two or three and follows an excellent time to do that so\nYou have them on to talk about some of the better trade some of their favorite trees that are out there and one of the series that came up was called the Freeman I maples it's a hybrid maple a series of hybrid maples enter a cross\nBetween red maples you remember the old October glories and red sunsets still out there still strong performers\nCome across bread with silver maples no silver maples if you're familiar with them I Would is I've always said I Would never recommend a silver may hold anybody although a as a kid I planted a couple of my parents' yard and one of them is still there today with about a\nThree and a half foot Trump diameter which is in huge and it's every year it has to be cleaned out in Deadwood in it and all of that\nUm but it has grown over all these years and still pretty good sized tree but\nYou know it's it's a it's been a messy tree through all these years but anyway [noise] never recommend a silver maple but obviously the red maples a with a ... medium growing tree good branching structure obviously the red maples were developed for the red fall colors now a share route room which is a red maple\nIsn't really called red maple because of the fall color is called red maple because of the red flowers in the springtime\nBut then they found red maples that had read fall color the been began developing the cult of ours that you see out there today I went from there but\nThe folks a plant breeders out there took the the best qualities of the red maples\nAnd cross that with a silver maple to get a tree a hybrid maple that gives you all the great benefits of the red maple that we just talked about good branching structure harder would um the the fall colors the size and shape\nCrossed it with a silver maple which gives us the ability to take on about any type of soil um they'll grow just about anywhere and there are a faster growing tree\nSo it took this medium growing tree to make it a medium to a faster growing tree that tolerates a lot of different soil conditions a lot of different sites\nWith ... with a with great red and orange and yellow fall colors depending on the selection you pick\nAnd they've turned out to be a an excellent group of um cult of ours hybrids are called the bars that have just done an excellent job and they're called the Freeman I series\nA seer Freeman I and then the name of the tree and about a two thousand and six or so we first introduced a autumn blase blase was a two thousand I think six or two thousand eight urban tree of the year\nThe municipality of ... in an of a useful ... I'm Sorry the\nSociety municipal our race I Believe it is anyway they chose their tree of the year they do every year or urban tree the air and that was their tree of the year\nAnd it really brought a lot of attention to these new hybrids that were coming along autumn blaze being one of the first\nAnd continues to be probably the most popular that's being sold out there today absolutely wonderful tree but then there are other varieties that came along all they have\nA little bit more you know there's a distinct something about each one of them I'm a little different than the other\nAnd so today what I've done is on our plans of the week on run Wilson online dot com\nA feature both on and blaze and CNN Glenn which I Believe was the second one that was introduced after autumn blaze 'em and you can see Sienna Glenn but then there I've listed about six or seven other Freeman's selections that you will find that your local nurseries and garden centers\nThese hybrids are not something that is hard to track down I'm becoming very very common place in the nursery isn't in the garden centers so if you're looking for that\nUm medium to large growing shade tree forty five fifty feet plus\nSome more upright than others more rounded hasn't again you have to learn about each one they have their own little thing about them take a look at these Freeman I selections\nAnd again I've listed a I think about five or six on there for you to take a look at a couple of pictures on there for your bottom blaze in Sienna Glenn but I think they're actually choices for you as far as that larger growing with a little bit of speed to give you something in a reasonable amount of time\nShade tree or in the yard garden or can be used as a street tree it can be um if it's in an era I don't like playing any thinking that narrow area between the sidewalk and this and the side and the street\nUnless it's about eight feet wide less than that it's just not a good thing you're always going to be I don't care what tree put in there it always has the potential of lifting up the sidewalk overtime or filling up the area because it's such a small area it I don't care what you put in there even ornamental trees although takes them longer but they still have those issues as well\nBut again great tree overall tree for all again lawns shade tree a street tree again it's called a seer Freeman I\nThat's the theory of the um the hybrid seed name and then he got all the cult of ours that go with it so check it out to run Wilson online dot com quickly come back we'll continue talking got lots

existing landscape been around for\nTen Fifteen Twenty years maybe even longer and you're looking out there and you see me and I'd really like to\nChange it around a little bit change it up renovate a little bit but you just not sure where to start and you watch some of those TV shows or the or the what shows do it yourself shows the Iowa I'm Sorry and you know they just go in there and a tear everything up and start all over again well you know not everybody can do that\nAs a matter of fact in many cases you don't need to do that you can actually work with what you have\nWell I found a book that can help walk you through the process of garden renovation you can evaluate what you have to say what you want and put your plan into action and transform your yard into the garden of your dreams the name of the book is garden renovations written by my good friend Bobby Schwartz and she's with us this morning ...\nGood morning Ron good to have you on a show with us finally lovely to be with you well you're such a popular person out there always speaking to everybody and tell them how to do this\nWe're ... we had to wait in line to finally get John here oh sure great first of all great book very well done\nThank you I'm looking at it did call on everything I've learned in over forty years of gardening and landscape design\nForty years oh yeah you started when you were fine as well [laughter] so you started as a kid\nI actually did not no one in my family was a gardener yeah uh but when we bought our very first house it came with a garden and my next door neighbor came over introduced himself\nAnd proceeded to name every plant and tell me how to take care of it and then I started reading and try and link plan I got hooked\nAbsolutely obsessed with plants and now you could say that I turned into a plant and John than having so much fun with plants ever since and eventually I had friends and neighbors ask for advice\nAnd I realized I really did more than they did so I started a business uh by picking a name buying a vendors license so that I could buy a wholesale cell retail\nAnd we're talking forty years ago I was charging ten dollars an hour for my consulting surfaces wow [laughter] and then I started taking courses and landscape design and joining professional associations that that I was always attending seminars and workshops and\nNetworking with other people in the industry and the rest is history\nThan the rest is history and of course then you are smart enough to take pictures of things that you've done over the years\nI was always photographed and there are two hundred and Seventy five photos in the book and two hundred and sixty of them are mine\nWell that's\nThat's phenomenal body Schwartz is with us this morning the name of her book is garden renovation your website is ... dot com correct that's correct\nBy so you can go to a website as well and check it out to be jeep some a dot com the book is garden renovation 'em and you know this this really does make a lot of sense because what you like you were describing what you see you and when you get called out to do is probably you know the clean slate to the clean pilot\nDoesn't happen that much you know you heard does but you know it's it's the folks that have\nInherited an existing landscaper had an old landscape and whenever I Do with it to make it to ... up or make it a little bit better and you do watch those shows you only going they just rip everything on start all over again\nWell not everybody has that kind of a budget and in many cases which is what you do to help and that's what this book helps as well there are so many things you can continue to use and incorporate into changing in a room\nThere's generally speaking there is no need to rip everything out and as you say it's very expensive to do that so I generally do not work on new homes because there's nothing there to start with\nA instead I work with owners are the existing properties and I I have found two things that you mentioned evaluating the landscape and then figuring out what you want I Would have reversed that water\nI Would say sit down and write down what your goals are you um watch don't like about what you have what do you wish you had that you don't have\nIs there any way that you want to change the style is it to form or do you want to make it less formal\nDo you have something that is it working for you for instance a patio that might be too small for your family or for entertaining and once you set your goals takes you won't be able to do everything at once [laughter]\nSet your priorities and then figure out your budget because there's no sense designing the Taj Mahal if all you can afford a log cabin\nSo then you're ready to take pen and paper and walk outside and look at your property\nPeople want something beautiful to look at ...\nThese that are comfortable to be in but they don't actually want to garden mhm um and at the plant to haul I I obviously love plants\nBut there are so many plants that are available many of which are not used um which I think is really a shame because every\nGarden every landscape should be different they shouldn't be cookie cutter and they should reflect the personality the place\nWhere the property is located and the needs of the client everyone should be different and I hate driving around seeing front yards that all look the same and there are a lot of them\nThe other thing people need to know is what can be saved because sometimes the plants have grown so big usually because people either are afraid to prone or don't know how to prune\nAnd there are many plants I'm evergreens in particular that can be proven brought down to size sometimes they're just too big and you do have to rip them out and I hate to do that but\nSometimes it's inevitable\nSure and so again that's what this book really helps to walk you through um things to look at how to evaluate who ... coming up with a budget when somebody says the ... you know the low maintenance thing that's become like the those are the two famous words though are what are you looking for a low maintenance right or do I mean seriously do kind of charcoal a little bit\n[noise] I Do a little bit but I also understand that\nWhen I started designing generally speaking I'm a property was owned by a husband and wife right there we have changes mhm we partners now um\nAnd it used to be that one person in the couple worked and the other one's stayed home\nSo had time to guard and now most of the time both partners are working and that's one of the reasons people are asking for lower maintenance\nAnd I make it very clear that there's no such thing as no maintenance you can lower maintenance by your choice of plant\nAnd one of the important aspects of that is buying something that is smaller than you want it ultimately to be\nBecause nurseries and garden centers do not sell plants that are at their ultimate growth looked at the time so you have to have patience\nUm because if you buy something that is as big as you want it to be now it means it's going to get even bigger right and you are creating maintenance problems for the future\nSure Bobby Schwartz is with us this morning her book is called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams are website is Bee Gees some\nDot com how about we got a couple of minutes to go here John requests for working um you know growing our own foods now becoming very popular and trained in corporate corporate that into our patios and and landscapes as well do you see that being on your project list as well\nI Do um the biggest deterrent particularly that at least in in the Cleveland area is dear mhm um and so\nI'm having to design garden set are fenced and then out there is the problem of whether to create raised beds because edibles need really good soil\nAnd sometimes the best way to do it is if you ever raised bed or a container than you are really in charge of the soil otherwise you have to do a lot of soil amendment\nBecause that doubles 'em and fruits do not grow well in heavy clay non training soil\nThe book again is called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams was written by ... Schwarz for a a Web site again is be jeep some dot com ... about a minute to go so folks are interested in this book where can they find that\nOkay they can go to my website and click on contact um they can write to me and said that they want to copy if the book that prices twenty four Ninety five and if I may handling it to them and I obviously will autograph it for them I'm\nNo extra charge not for the phone for the autograph All right for the state will absolutely [laughter] and it\nIs you know three dollars and Seventy five cents\nSo I just looked inside mind it's not autographed\nWell when we get together you'll have to bring it with\nYou okay All right on with me next time we have breakfast together that threat like right now and they can also buy it on Amazon and ... or any independent bookseller\nIndependent booksellers Amazon of course her website again it's Bee Gees on dot com the name of the book garden renovation transferring when you're into the garden of your dreams Bobby Schwartz\nA and it's such a pleasure having you on her show and I I really I mean this is a an outstanding book I highly recommend it and we will continue to promote this was we'd go into the holiday season 'cause I think it's a good one for the holiday gifts as well\nThank you so much rent been a pleasure talking to Bobby always a pleasure take care okay All right Bye bye\nBody shorts and again the name of the book garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams\nUnless you said most all the pictures that are in here she took them over all the years and she literally addresses about any and every thing you\nKnow you would address in your yard and gardening\nAnd I'm Talking sidewalk front door walls whatever maybe she addresses them all\nOn how you can to renovate using what you have\nWithin your budget and it just absolutely outstanding was like a quick break we come back we will continue on our website run Wilson online dot com Facebook page and the guard with Ron Wilson and we're taking your calls at eight hundred a two three to five five here in the garden dairy Jeff Walker then run Wilson\nGuy rolling and no one eight hundred eighty two three talking you're listening to be in the garden with Ron ... says [noise]\n\nI Am married to Kathy for twenty seven years and I asked her for about Thirteen Years I'm\nCathy pastors last I Want to spend some quality time and our parents to take this with my husband and I realized we had to do something in my house\nI wasn't getting any younger and I wasn't getting any help here my husband told me about a ... they have them on the radio and listening to the health care program about getting to the root of the problems just kept coming back\nIn ... before I realized how this worked my way different types of my home I think they're fourteen years\nForty seven pounds of fat lost my actual medicine reflux medicine and\nThink I must have had parents to help there just isn't dietary program it sounds like\nIt's just amazing the successes and the results from out there it's just unbelievable\nDid you read consultation with the help they are to the idea of Columbia that idea of Columbia Dr report mornings use radio five six\nThe public in split on Saudi Arabia I'm ham who's now Fox News President Trump says he believes Saudi Arabia that journalist ... was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey during a fist fight the kingdom has a ... Eighteen people\nYeah stuck in a sand Williamson uh owner if I'm correct create a hearing the the ... now I'm again your process\nUsed to uh to be able to level the sucking slabs I've been replaced the concrete but I mean do you just come across some time some instances where you know that's just not go to work that it's just so so beat up it's just so damaged that does it really you can't do anything with it\nYeah it's you know I see it I see it often um you know typically about eight out of ten times there is something we can do ... but we we can't we can't fix everything so\nYou know we've really over the last four years\nI've I've been searching for someone that that I could align myself with it can come in and and that I could refer to that I trust in can rely on to tear out and report concrete and\nIt's been a long process but I finally found someone that that does a fantastic job and I just love being able to help people and and to have someone that I can refer ... is it it does nothing but help us so sure\nSo this is someone who's actually come in and yeah and actually tear up the concrete and reframe it report and everything\nAnd that's you know we're not in the business to tear out report on there so many more benefits\nTo what we do but it ended a day sometimes it's necessary and so I'm just happy to to say that we finally found someone that we you know trust and rely on\nPlus it's you know with all the\nAll the builder business that's going on now I mean there's\nYou know the market's great ... builder business going on in most of these you know tear out report folks are looking for the builder business 'cause they know that they're going to get say you know fifty hundred houses in a year so you know it's hard to find the people that will want to come in and do a smaller job\nRight well good to know this or someone you can refer folks to have in that situation bugs eight out of ten times yup this method works I Know what are the advantages that we talked about the past was\nYou're not actually replacing the concrete that's there so in the again you until you have this issue may not think much about it but to replace that concrete it's going to look different from the rest of his nose around it\nAbsolutely not mentioning your just going to get torn up this is going to take a lot longer um sometimes you have to take fences down just to get to it if say it's a\n... a lot more expensive than our process as well is a phenomenal process I've seen it in action and again if you've got stuck on slabs where the big labs around the the driveway or the uh\nThe pool area if you have a pool of like we did our old home or or just a simple sidewalk a matter of fact we should probably ... again we taught us a couple of

to start off by asking this question we've talked about the past but it it it's it's good to to to reiterate the way this works now I mean we had a low via the morning on the upper forties around parts of the ... and everybody's excited\nIt's going to be a little you know it will be below our average today a bit but it will be much below by tomorrow so it's pretty natural when people think well false finally here\nUh you know it's approaching the end of October so the mosquitoes are going by by I don't need to worry about it that it's not the case\nNow we're still I mean it does feel it's a it's we're all welcoming this war this cooler weather ah we've really had a summer this kind of drug on all the way through some number an eighties and nineties every day it's been very hot very humid uh so I think we all welcome to school or weather but um you know keep in mind that it's it's it feels a lot cooler but\nWe're still a long way away from a actually getting rid of the mosquitoes so how far away are we so well adult mosquitoes or cannot survive in when the temperatures drop into the thirties\nEvery night for a week if you get one night where it drops down to thirty seven degrees that's not going to do it you need it every single night for about a week which here\nIn the ... that normally does not happen until about\nThanksgiving amount Thanksgiving first December that's usually when we'll get that cold snap\nThat will basically do it in for the for the adult mosquitoes\nAnd or unless we get a you know a little warm snap and two thousand sixteen we had that cold snap and it was great but then around Christmas Time we were back in the high seventies every single day mhm consistently over fifty degrees the mosquito eggs are going to start hatching\nAnd we had mosquitoes at Christmas Time we had customers call and say what in the world this is crazy to say well it's it's it's they think it's spring and um it didn't last that long I mean if we had the temperatures drop back down within a couple of weeks so didn't last that long but\nYou know mosquitoes pretty much all they do is they're born they're born as adults when they come out of the ... airborne is adult or to read the first day I Am [laughter]\nAnd ah they they are down to business or yeah that's right the female mosquitoes once they bred they need a protein meal or are they going to find some some blood bearing organism whether it's a bird a cat or dog or you know or human\nOr to bite to get some blood so that they can lay those eggs so they can breathe again and they do they breed and they lay eggs in an enormous\nA fashion they can lay up to three hundred eggs I'm at a time and they they can lay eggs about every three days so they could be laying a hundred eggs a day on average\nYou get ten female mosquitoes I mean you're talking you know in ten days they can lay o lot a lot of eggs um which all turned into larva which all become mosquitoes and and so forth but those eggs\nUm they don't all hatch right away they they're laying eggs all the time and there's literally millions and millions of eggs all over the place\nUm but if the conditions are not exactly right they don't hatch dissolve a match right away but some of 'em just incubate and\nThe interesting thing about mosquitoes is those eggs can have a can incubate\nFor up to five years was up to five years until the conditions are are exactly right which is why a lot of people think of we have a hard freeze man that'll do it in for the mosquitoes absolutely it it really has zero difference there is no amount of hold\nThe worst mosquitoes in the planet or in Alaska and we'll never have wind [laughter]\nAlaska so I'm sitting here thinking well if you wanted to get away from it skews have to go someplace like maybe Alaska\nYeah well they're the bugs are horrible in Alaska and the reason is because they have so much moisture by the time in the spring comes and the snow finally melts and when they get those temperatures in the consistently over fifty degrees like\nWell you know here are are eggs start hatching usually late February early March when those extra ... because we start getting temperatures consistently over fifty degrees\nThat's the conditions are start right there and some of them will start hatching well by the time that happens in Alaska yes it's way later but when it happens everything is sopping wet\nI mean every single meal really wet with so a lot more eggs are going to happen a lot shorter period of time you look at the northern climates like New York\nUm Detroit we have mosquito Joe in both of those places they do very very well as the shorter season but it's way more intense way more mosquitoes and a lot shorter period of time um and uh you know ours we kind of have a slow hatching uh here in South Carolina\nWho is a fun fact for you when it comes mosquitoes right there who knew\nA trainer who [laughter] so ... again ... ... this reiterate here we're talking with ray powerful mosquito Joe\nFor\nFor for the was the ... the active mosquito population to die off we need overnight lows into the mid to upper thirties for five days correct right yep\nThis four days maybe kills off a few of them some of them but not all of them correct so five days is kind of magic number mid to upper thirties yep\nUm if we get a warm spike like you referenced Christmas the twenty sixteen the only takes maybe four or five days of temperatures getting into the around here in the seventies maybe like the direction\nConsistently over fifty degrees because over ... over fifty degrees\nYou want to hear a tray I mean we we often have winters where we don't get much below fifty at least not consistently fried temperature\nIt's usually I Do I night it's dropping okay low that that's where it needs to be consistently around the clock what happened in in what I Believe is twenty sixteen\nIs it was getting into the seventies everyday and it was in the fifties and sixties at night I Know it was like I'd really like almost like springtime at in December really out of you know saying but what happened\nIs that it started ... mosquito eggs\nAnd now let me ask you this that I Know from our past discussions but folks who've never use the service like yours mosquito Joe May wonder well why can't you just come out one time and spray my yard and that's it well\nIt it does make a difference I mean it will it will do about an eight percent knock\nUm but the key to mosquito control to get where you want to be is you have to break that breeding cycle and you have to maintain that on that property and you know you're talking about an outside environment and you're talking about uh flying insect and this is this outside environment is exposed to heat UV\nWind rain you know all these things they break the products down\nAnd you know this is why you need to treat every three weeks you know you try and do this\nOutside of that three weeks cycle there's a lot of the people that try and do this on the side they have another business but they're trying to do mosquito control on the side and most of them trying to fit this into their schedule and they try and do this on a little bit longer cycle for weeks six weeks things like that and it just doesn't work um it it works some but\nIt doesn't work really really well\nYou know all these eggs hatch and as adults and getting right down to business right\n... exactly immediately the very first day and they're laying eggs that if you don't break that breeding cycle you're not going to be people don't want to pay for something that's just okay if they weren't really worked great like wow this is amazing like I I you know the life here customers they all the time you know I Would give up a lot of things but I Would not give up\nMy mosquito treatment I mean this is this has made a huge difference in our life and in our yard\nAnd I got to tell you I mean a mosquito Joe comes to my house every three weeks and it's it's just really phenomenal every night we go walk the dog and\nAs soon as we get off the property you know were fair game here like um like um oh look they've left the house [laughter] you waiting for you at the end of the driveway back on the property alcohol I guess a barrier as like a wall that's right ... build the wall [laughter] go ahead\nBuild that wall is your place now let me ask you this\nBecause I'm curious\nYou know you always hear people say I'm white had gotten been so and so\nAre there any redeeming benefits to the mosquito I'm just curious\nAre they're really not that I can think of I mean a lot of uh you know I hear a lot of people say well they're they're food for the birds a lot of times people will talk about the purple Martin since since that's a big thing here in Columbia I'm particularly out at lake Murray\nUm mosquitoes are very very small on a a bird would have to eat a whole lot of mosquitoes to actually make a meal they would much prefer a grasshopper or a beetle or some other insect that is a little more substance to and we'll meet again this is a really really small probably the little uh\nThose little ... million a little lizards around your house probably more of a meal for them or or uh", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "year": "2018", "city": "Columbia", "day": "20"}
