{"month": "10", "state": "SC", "station": "WVOC", "content": "Not I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that they're there and they certainly believe that we exist and so the\nThe old game is is that they don't want us to know that they're they're they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is\nOf the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed\nPeople who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs ... practice something called modern actresses and and that ... that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... ... homes because people have lived\nIn there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so to negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's\nEmotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy\nThat is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of at first the negative emotional energy has to be removed\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police say sharman priest\nExercises I don't belong to any particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway is really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes they're already\nIn the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment\nAnd they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great extra assistant every religion I'm not the only one\nOr they're qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which called me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website
