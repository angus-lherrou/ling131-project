that the five AM I said out from the national Hurricane Center in coral Gables [noise] I'm\nNot a whole lot of change from yesterday uh well the only the the big change is that they expected to be stronger when it comes on shore ah so I'm thinking you know yesterday was probably a cat to maybe a cat three and now they're saying is definitely a category three storm\nBy the time and makes landfall which is expected to be a some time ah tomorrow I'm probably about mid day along the Florida Panhandle uh somewhere around the Appalachian coal in between there and Panama City beach in that in that area right there\nAs a strong hurricane a category three major storm here\nRight now at least as a five AM updates Ninety about an hour maximum sustained wins\nA for Michael which attain to sort of king status as the eleven o'clock updated yesterday morning only to get stronger before it makes landfall a so here's what we're watching a ... at least for the initial impacts\nAlong the Florida Gulf Coast the storm surge is going to be the big issue there spots that are going to see eight to twelve feet of storm surge\nThat's a very shallow um the the the the drop off from the coastal areas of the the beach into the ocean there is a the Gulf I should say is a very shallow which is not good news is that what was going to pile up in the income on shore there are spots will be just totally inundated by this\nCertainly the wind's going to be an issue as well uh the rainfall amounts not a huge concern because of how quickly the storm's going to move\nHow fast will this thing move well right now it's moving at twelve miles an hour you recall Florence at a time was down to about a walking pace as it moved through our state a couple of weeks ago this one's not going to be like that so the good news for us is the rainfall amounts won't be what but\nOf course we didn't see a whole lot from Florence here in the ... but this one may gets track right over the middle east as well although coming from a a different spot to from the south in the west up through the ... that's going to be on Thursday\nIt looks like a we will begin to see some of the initial impacts of Michael or by tomorrow night\nBut Thursday's looks like it's going to be our day a National Weather service are calling for an increased chance of showers tonight about sixty percent chance of rain tonight tomorrow or throughout the day a Ninety percent rain chance\nAs we see some of the euro initial impacts of this storm began to approach the area that is going to be tomorrow night's and in the day on Thursday through Thursday where we see tropical storm conditions possible for us\nAll told we're looking at a they're thinking of maybe four inches of rain\nA total for us uh we will deal with some tropical storm force winds apparently\nHas it makes its way through uh the probabilities going to the national Hurricane Center that we see tropical storm force winds which again are defined as wind speeds that excessive thirty nine miles an hour\nFor a minute or more were in the er fifty them maybe sixty percent chance of her a range of that happening here so that's something that will have to be concerned about as far as a downed trees and power lines and power outages\nAre the earliest reasonable\nA rival of a tropical storm force winds for us as a national arcane Center for us\nUh looks like tomorrow night about eight o'clock the most likely a is going to be\nA sometime probably the overnight hours into early Thursday morning for tropical storm force winds start to impact our area so\nI'll get all told 'em two to four inches of rain\nTropical storm force winds could see a sustained winds of the dome ... twenty to twenty five maybe thirty mile an hour range with the potential for higher gusts upwards of fifty or so miles an hour solar wind wise pretty much what some parts of the middle unsolved with Lawrence\nOr the rainfall totals though\nAgain they won't be much different for us here that as opposed to what Florence brought us pretty much about the same really but certainly other parts of the day which got hammered what the rain from Florence won't see that kind of rain here but we're ... we're concerned about those spots\nIn the PTA along the coastal areas is all the the flooding and those rivers have yet to uh to really received back to their normal levels so or any more rainfall but that comes in here is this going to be I'm going to be a bit of an issue fortunately the coastal areas the PT the grand strand\nUp in eastern North Carolina along the outer banks are they're only looking at to well maybe two to four inches which they could probably do without but it won't be as bad as it could have been\nSo um that's the latest on Michael er and the track again pretty consistent with both the euro the G fs models\nAll these spaghetti plot noodle lines habit rolling right through the midlands a few out or the outer of lines have it maybe a little more to our west we would prefer to stay open the midlands or to the east because we don't want to be on the right side of that storm as we know\nThat's where you have the uh the potential for tornadic activity and his father was telling us yesterday where we're not talking about the Kansas type tornadoes these would be tornadoes that blow up quickly and die off just as quick\nBut they could still do a lot of damage so that that you ride right front quarter in particular is the place you don't want to be and it looks as though we won't be in that area but still too early to tell certainly but yeah that's quitting over\nSo uh we'll be talking about this the next couple of days and by friday it'll be out of here and we're back to sunshine hopefully doesn't leave too much in its wake [noise]\nAll right we'll I talked to follow the again later on in the eight o'clock out of this morning John front of the chief meteorologist ABC Columbia to get his in depth look at all of us are they've ramped it up again over the EMT of course um they uh it just got done with foreign it seems\nBecause you know like flooding in the aftermath of ... kept him busy for a couple of weeks after Florence they really just got things back to normal now their rent and back up again and how and again this is gonna be a quicker event here but still it comes in the midst of campaign season we're four weeks away from the midterms here\nAnd we know the governor's race was that was put on hold\nFor a bit because of Florence and then even afterwards or the governor was a very tied up as was James Smith working with the national guard in uh the efforts are dealing with the flooding in the aftermath of Florence so ...\nHow what kind of impact does this have on the governor's race

catalogs the website to go get signed up there the\nWeather will be terrific for that once we get to this Michael thing All right up in the bigger scheme of things that I don't think it changes anything here uh you know I guess what was the one or two more public hearing\nIs that uh the PS the is holding for people to weigh in on uh the impending sale upscale onto a dominion and of course the the rate reduction which is still in effect for now the PS the ruling won't be long now my by December they got a rural this\nAnd that we already had our our nighttime here in Columbia which I thought was sparsely attended\n... being positive and I say that sparsely so I you know this story that the post and courier um put up on their website yesterday is their print edition today\nAbout a potential fraud over a Jenkins veiled fraud that executives versus Ghana were recording the story aware of\nBut Mm covered it up\nI don't know that this means anything as far as what's getting ready to happen happens but I I Do think till today again points to is yours like to say who knew what when\nAnd this goes back to twenty Fifteen or\nThe allegations are that executives at scanner or learned about a million dollar bid rigging scheme but never never reported it uh\nIn order to avoid any negative publicity about the project so and this goes back to the who knew what when thing\nAs we know that your S's contending now that uh the\nThe the any any rate increase it happened after I Can't remember the exact day but I think it wasn't twenty Fifteen that any rate increase it was a bit effects should all be rolled back in the customers you get their money back\n\nAnd if if this bid rigging skiing again reported to be about a million dollars worth was covered up by scan executives as far back as twenty Fifteen because they wanted to avoid negative publicity than most people snooping around to find out what would be the question well\nThe story is is a company ... and the county ... world that was selling ... office supplies desks shares this and that and the allegation is the owner of the company\nWas also submitting bids from competitors and had forged the competitor signatures on these bits to make his look more attractive\nOr these were supplies um furniture in the like sold to a one of the subcontractors out there this is a Chicago bridge in iron\n\nA win scanner found out about this they hired some attorneys to a complete background checks and took a look at whether or not these purchases\nOr we're uh we're above board or not and although they found was that considered possible civil and criminal fraud claims against this a subcontractor Chicago bridge and I and\nThat's the outfit to approve the purchases as it turns out the purchasing officer for CPS I had a primary relationship with the owner of ... world\nAnd it looks like according to the story they wound up with all sorts of chairs in Des ... ... a lot more than what they needed\nYou care to work side you're ordering all this office for sure what you need some of it but you're hiring crafts people to do the job that they're they're not sitting on their butts in an office somewhere\nI don't know maybe they were well yeah because as it turns out maybe they were who knows\nUh [noise] you\nKnow for the record the guy that owns a company world oh was that you know I didn't do anything wrong here I think as I recall he even admitted to actually signing some of these other bids here you mean forging yes yes forging will be the ... the appropriate word yes\nAnd again the whole idea according to allegations as he was doing this because he was submitting basically sell the company is higher than it is which turned out his were pretty exorbitant too\nBecause now none of that has anything to do with what the ... considering hear it but it does again go back to show that this was something that scan executives were very well aware of that it had taken place\nBut they didn't report it\nThey didn't report it because they didn't want to buy these looping around over there taking a look at the books to see what was going on so we get back to the same old question who knew what when\nNow if the post and courier get a hold of this is the or S. know about it will they pursue it will they present that to the public service commission well they know about it now how it's going to be out\nYeah but it no I mean now you know you're not under as much pressure to stick with it late at least ... has proven himself and SEC competition\nI guess the
