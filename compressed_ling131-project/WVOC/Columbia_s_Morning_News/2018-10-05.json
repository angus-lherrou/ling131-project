C. your morning it is that in fourteen I'm Gary along with the team this is Colombia's morning news for friday October\n... big day on Capitol Hill joined them the segment by NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... he's got the latest on the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination Michael good morning sir it's gonna be a busy day to day\nIf you thought the drama was high yesterday I think today is going to be just a little bit higher yet at the fact that it's a friday you out of the fact that we've\nGot a nine thirty AM or at least at this time scheduled re convening of the Senate it's going to be having a vote at ten thirty in regards to the procedural vote and that's really gonna be the first indication that we are going to have\nFor any of these swing votes in regards to the Kavanaugh nomination in regards to Lisa Murkowski the Jeff Flake Susan Collins and and Joe Manchin where they said this is going to be an indicator they could\nEither go in favor of the process that we're looking at here for the procedural vote and then\nHave thirty hours of debate from there that means you could have Kevin ... having a vote\nCome friday night tonight at five thirty if it goes a little further than that that it could be bumped back to a Saturday late Saturday if there's an additional thirty hours of debate or up or whatever the extension will be from there but today is going to be the indicator today is going to be the time that we see what those people are at least thinking in regards to casting that vote for Kavanaugh\nSo let's talk about the procedure here ah Michael so ten thirty this morning as gifts\nFor this procedural vote a and that opens up as you mentioned a thirty our window which you know you could take all thirty hours or just a few hours I mean we don't know right exactly\nRight or you\nCan also have you can also have at that point so you get a lot of time so what happens is you get a procedural vote receives a majority\nIn the Senate will move forward on a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination whatever time that takes so the Senate uses a whole lot of time of thirty hours a debate the vote for Kevin I was going to be around five thirty PM or so this evening now at fifty one senators vote in favor of passing at the upper chamber were curve\nThat debate on cabinet nominees still kind of tight I'll say no more\nNo boy you know we're going to be stopping from here now in case there's any kind of a tie in regards to that Mike Pence able to step in and break it and then once those thirty is our hours of debate or up the Senate will move to the final vote for the confirmation in which case if it gets delayed because of however long people are debating this could be Saturday evening on some level\nSo we we we could actually ... I mean it's possible that you can get a this vote today in favor of a of of ending the debate and moving forward but you know someone who sinners we're watching you know the uh\nLisa Murkowski's the Susan Collins and then the Jeff ... of the world could actually vote today in the procedural vote one way and they could vote another way for the final vote\nAbsolutely they could vote to end the delight of the thirty hours of of debate back and forth and then they could still do not have any idea at that point is who they're voting for until it comes time for an actual thumbs up or thumbs down\nFor the overall a approval of of of uh Brett Kavanaugh so you don't know where they necessarily stand this is an indicator this would be the early morning would be an indicator because if for some reason they're feeling this morning\nThat they just can't back in that they've made that decision and that's not going to happen then you're going to see them possibly cast a vote to continue that debate you're going to see them possibly even say in the in the realm of the debate that they're not interested in this that might cause somebody like Mitch McConnell ago if I don't have them\nOr if I'm not clear if I don't have them maybe we shouldn't be voting on this and maybe we should in fact withdraw the name of judge Kavanaugh look are there places it could cause cabinet to withdraw his name on some level all that kind of drama is still out there may not be likely and I don't know what the odds and Vegas are that but it would certainly say that they could be possible that that kind of drama could still happen\nNow again up until yesterday we were looking at five potential centers were swing votes your Heidi Heitkamp coming out and saying I'm going to vote against this she's a she's twelve point deficit latest Fox poll in the in North Dakota nurse in a race against Kramer so people were wondering about her but she's made her decision she will not support the nomination uh the according\nTo her she she said it was about looking yourself in the mirror every morning even though she's that double digit you know for the midterm elections the double digit deficit she wasn't able really to get over at this point so there's a couple of different elements that with the political element or was she really casting a vote that she was concerned about cabinet\nOn right mentioned we all ... states when big for Trump or he doesn't sell a lot I mean he was one of these centers was accosted by protesters yesterday but I guess the big news out of yesterday was what we heard from flake and from Collins\nAnd almost mirroring each other saying that they both felt that the investigation from the FBI was a very thorough investigation both of them saying that they were going back to uh read more into it read some of the interviews from there are so\nWhether or not that lead you to believe that they're going to give it a thumbs up it's still a question right now right it could just be that they're giving a thumbs up to the FBI rather than whether or not they think Kavanaugh is somebody that should be sitting on the Supreme Court so that question is still out there Lisa Murkowski who was held her cards a little bit closer to the chest\nShe's saying that she's still reading the entirety of the report but she didn't eat with dozens of sexual assault survivors from her home state of Alaska yesterday and her offices so whether that means she's just getting\nA hearing them out whether that means that she's getting questions from them or things that she would need to bring to the table if there's these lengthy debates that they're going to have not sure but at least it shows her listening in and possibly coming up with some questions\nMansion as he mentioned just basically said Heidi made her decision on my mind and that's a big nothing burger from him\nYeah NBC News radio national corresponded Michael ... joining us this morning on Columbia
