the time but since then or the now now the reports\nAre fast and furious for saw this in the post and courier yesterday that a a a state judge says judge John ... is the third according to people that are familiar with a weird he's thinking here may in fact overturned the base load Review Act\n\nThe piece of legislation that allowed a scanner as the energy\n\nTo uh start charging us higher rates for something that well we didn't have any benefit of yet as you're older you know the story to a point and reach red metal ground but this is a\nIs a big deal\nScanner spheres yesterday were down almost eleven percent I think we're a pretty much officially at the point now where scanner shares of lost half of their value from where they were\nSummer of twenty Seventeen was in the Seventy seven dollar range that out about what thirty six dollars that I see\nAnd and just a reminder because this is why I mentioned in the last half hour Brad how do the state senator who apparently leaked this information to begin with remember he represents the electric cooperative right\n\nOh which obviously will be more involved on this anti Cooper side of things than just makes yet as I mentioned last hour just makes you wonder what his motivation\nI'm not I'm not sure I'm not clear on why he would would say this\nBut regardless or the fact apparently is in Ghana is\nIs saying yeah they um ... from what scanners saying their understanding is is that the judge has asked in this this uh this is sort of these environmental groups and others who are suing over the base load of you act has asked them to include\nIn their uh filings\nThat they believe the base load of you like to be unconstitutional and again that people are familiar with the judge is thinking say that he is inclined to overturn it now we may get a ruling on he may issue this ruling as early as next week\n\nHowever the ruling would not take effect until uh these\nTrials take place and none of them started yet so that part of it could be a long ways down the road and certainly will be appealed and all that but let's not put the cart before the horse here none of that really matters right now because two things\nThat were just

quiet here as of late\nAnd they have they have done a few you know get to know what's kind of meetings and all that but I mean they're they're marketing efforts\nHave um the dried up there they're not ... they're not allowed to mail either on ... and broadcasts ... ads or in in digital ads on you know social media sites I mean they've been very quiet\nMakes you wonder if they're starting to see the writing on the wall and think you know what this isn't going to happen in South Carolina after all\nYeah you you have to think that if again regardless of when this ruling would actually take effect that would be way down the road\nThat doesn't matter you know if this judge says next week the B a B LA there'd be a law is unconstitutional more likely demand is going to walk here what does this me\nTwo things number one uh that ruling could lead to a total you're taking off the books off your bill of any nuclear surcharge it all again uh most of its off for now at least to the end of the

about a story that showed up on the Daily Caller one day about a James Smith but wow that's the Daily Caller or ... what's that all about\nIt was a a story then that the claim that uh Smith might have used as a veteran status\nTo broker a federal contracts and was acting as a quarter the allegations is a middle man a use a disabled veteran\nAnd we do thank him for his service absolutely but\nThe claim was the allegation was exactly the middleman here in securing a some pretty uh pretty handsome federal contracts\nAnd just using his status as they will veteran to pass this through his group the Congo regroup to other companies that didn't have that same status\nAnd that uh he had been hit a\nAt least one contract revoked as a result of it\nWell at at the time I'm Smith spokesperson then I'll listen Miller\nSaid that uh well you know the the straight and all that out and we had ... votes the ability of the talk of regroup his company to obtain some contracts but they reverse that decision every appeal and that was pretty much you know the story\nUntil now we know stories back out again\nThis time around uh the reports are is that uh his company to come to regroup\nThat they refused to order declined to cooperate with an inspection this apparently happening or earlier this year we're going to get this goes back to me again when we first heard about this story\nThat they had not cooperating with an inspection of the business and as a result at least one of the federal contracts that he has a has been revoked\nNow he says he's still eligible for contracts with other federal agencies but not what the VA\nAnd according to um the Smith campaigned yesterday they didn't have time to produce the business documents required by inspectors while running his campaign for governor and that if he wins election next month or next month that he plans to close the company anyway\n[noise] well yeah I don't\nI'd love to know how many people work for the ... because there's

states in the country require\nThat homes have proper gutter and you can't you can't build a new home without it\nYou can't sell a home in forty seven states without proper garnering we're not one of those states as a result only about two intent homes have proper gutter so that's a bunch of homes that has water going right down to the base of the home infiltrating the foundation and causing big time foundation or parishes\nIn a bad ones in charge of ten thousand dollars or more\nRight so why did I was a good investment because when you called dug in all states are you going to find their
