I have no qualms about it at all\nShe did a good job of explaining the differences between well a better job public that her we'd be busted the route has dressed as his that's his style yeah but I mean she you know explain they brought two different sets of eyes to it to any problem\nAt all in all those a very civil a debate last night I think the only time in the entire a debate\nThat are either candidate attack the other one was after a a must have been talked about you know bring your fresh set of eyes to things somebody not inside politics of a business woman and how that would that would play a ... but no real responded about a lack of experience\nYou know I always think it's so funny when people are asking for the um for inexperience as as as equaling fresh ideas\nYou know if you need to get your car worked on are you going to go to somebody who never worked on a car 'cause they might have a French idea about how to fix our car you're going to go to somebody who has worked on a car before because they are going to know how to do it\nYeah courtesy of ETV the audio they are now the that was really the only\nPersonal um we've we've called on attack but I'm the most part of the two agreement a lot of things\nYeah now powers no real took a lot of shots at Henry McMaster yeah even if she wasn't taking shots at the end of it right so personally\nThat was only shut it used to have it but no she took quite a number of shots of master last night and they talked about a number of things and pretty much the same sorts of things that we saw on the governor's debate um [noise] the probably the one weird thing I thought ever did was where they talked about jobs she she she mentioned uh\nAttitude and uh that that was maybe a weak spot for her last night but when\nIt came to medicate I thought this was a very good response by other last night um ... was asked about ... if she Jim Smith are elected about expanding Medicaid and and and would that happen in in this state\nWe are going to expand Medicaid and I am so excited about that because I say one after James ... who is going to accept the federal\nHealth care fines and he is going to provide health care coverage for three hundred thousand south Carolinians who don't have it today no of course\nTheir line of reasoning all along is that we don't we're not accepting all these federal dollars wouldn't

already\n[noise] good to have you here I'm Gary David Christopher Thompson is here a rash dot and Jonathan Kelly the dominion deal back their topic I you know and and let's talk about that here uh [noise]\nThat we always have to preface all this by again reminding\nYou that any day that we can have a circuit court judge here in our state ruled the be all already is unconstitutional and all that could be off now\nAgain if that's in fact the ruling that just means that that wouldn't actually play out until all these these ... lawsuits against Ghana\nOr or or or you go through their trials\nAnd and even then it'll be appealed so we're talking about if it's all ruled unconstitutional and scan has got to get everything back that can be a long way down the road however\nThe specter of that would would influenced debating this decision whether or not to stay in this deal when we were told that it'd be so they'd be settled with all that at\nOne point the dominion deal was either last week it would get done or it wasn't going to get done\nThat they had set a deadline because they knew this this\nJudge's ruling was coming saying the base load Review Act was unconstitutional and they wanted a deal on the table and signed before that judge's ruling came down\nBut there is no that apparently unless there was some kind of deal made in secret there's no deal yet which is and I'm not sure why legislators are wading into this at this point they they they\nHave all made their opinions known everybody has got a hand apparently whether they're Thirteen fourteen different parties to this lawsuit that is coming before the public service commission\n... everybody's had a chance to say\nI don't know why legislators on either the house or the Senate side at this point are weighing in at this point let the public service commission decide they've got all the information they've got all the evidence apparently they need even more because we're going to have a month of earrings\nStarting Thursday and at that point let them decide that one by the way one of the parties at the table next month will be the state house sure\nSo at first saw this article that the house speaker Jay Lucas was loading the benefits of this latest ... billion deal my first thought was okay this is this the back room deal here that did you get together with the little collusion here let's find something that maybe we can all go along with however\nI Would say this is I read through Lucas his reasoning and all this he does bring up some good points here this is the house speaker\nWho is saying that he thinks this latest dominion offer the one that takes a thousand dollar refund check off the table but reduces the rate the nuclear surcharge he thinks that's the way to go\n\nNow again this latest deal what we're all we have right now on your electricity bill if you're an S. C. E. N. G. customer is a Fifteen Percent rate reduction\nSo for the average utility user it's about a Twenty one dollar a month rate reduction still getting charged some of that nuclear surcharge but not like it was\nIt was twenty seven dollars you know announced on them you know whatever I'm six bucks whatever this second dominion deal would be a fourteen percent rate cut so it'd be about a twenty dollar a month reduction to what we weren't paying\nTheir first offer offer was about a ten dollar a month rate reduction so this one doubles that now Lucas is line of reasoning here\nIs that because the second dominion deal is so close dollar wise to what the state house did and the fact that the state house rate cut held up in court\nThat he's afraid of the office of regulatory staff goes for the whole and a lot of hear what the rate cut here that it's going to be to a point to where of course scandal is going to take 'em to court over this and there are no assurances the scandal won't win\n\nAnd we're still paying the full surcharge plus having to deal with all the cost of a lawsuit so ... says he's said that before yes I'm\nNot really sure why he decided just said again on October twenty night\nWell it was getting ready to ramp or I don't know maybe he's trying to save us maybe ... is this is is nothing more than just to reach out to the billion\nSay hold on hold on hanging you got you got allies or the state house without all that matters now are not as up\nThe P. S. C. but state house members do have a a a they got to see that this table next month so this is way of trying to salvage this deal to all the money they don't walk door\n\nSo as I read through it and hurt his reasoning here it does make some sense sure it made sense when he said at the first time you know\nSo half the things that you know Lucas is is concerned right now as you mentioned the ripple deadline out kids his knees get it done well we're going to walk into a movie that I buy a pair of Lucas does not want them and you're walking\nIs of the of the mind that if if if they do are going to wind up\nGetting stuck with this whole surcharge in you know ... wind up paying court costs and everything else\nIf they try to drop the rate much further than it is right now\n[noise] war well [noise] I don't it's I ... I got no clue at this point in time I ... I I I Can't for the light if the main stays in this deal if they don't pull out number one I Can't imagine the public service commission not approving the sale\nBut that's secondary to the big issue is what will the rate be\nNo clue\nBig utility right so I can be cynical for a moment okay maybe I Do know how this\nComes to well that's that's why I just assumed them just be one of the one of the Thirteen parties at the table and no more public comments no more private arm twisting just let the public service commission look at all the evidence and decide\n\nHere's what we do know when they finally decide somebody's not going to be happy you're going to be you are going to be big utility here\nWe're going to find out in ah well they got till December to rule here I Will give or take a child and Kelly on this dominion deal and this latest coming up when the rash thoughts in just a moment or two trafficking whether together now as a service of account temps tell though is that we've had some big problems out of ... junction this morning\nAnd started really early this morning twenty six he found just after Bush river road earlier this morning we had a tractor trailer car\nCollide we have the left lane closed for a while traffic was backed up all the way to the one hundred and a half mile marker now we have rights that lead partner got a button or in Fairfield\nUp the aisle south federal credit union traffic tip line someone parkway and hard Scrabble this report brought to you by pit stop convenience stores don't stop until you're pit stop the tip line number three for three ten fifty five your next update in ten minutes on by sixty WBRC\nJoanna quarterback Jake Bentley Dillon one on one of the FCC's freshmen of the week awards the want um brothers the first set of brothers in and see the history to win player of the week awards in the same week the game ... visit old miss Saturday at noon on the SEC Network Monday Night football the patriots pulling away late\nStatus and I'm certainly dropping back firing\nTwenty five thirty\nAs the patriots scored a pair of fourth quarter touchdowns they beat the bills twenty five to six the patriots winning their ... their six into buffalo lost his third straight to Boulder two inch six yesterday they were cleaning house in Cleveland\nA person has been a tremendous amount of time was huge action over the last two and a half years and so\nThis was not an easy decision\nBut owner Janine has made the decision to fire I'd go to Jackson and ...
