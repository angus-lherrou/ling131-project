uptown here a news radio five sixty Seventy ... don't forget we are changed clocks back this weekend right [noise]\nYeah bring forward fall back on\nBack [noise] seven thirteenth Monday October twenty nine I'm Gary there that right there the voice of Christopher ... good morning my friend the thought is celebrating\nGetting that extra hours sleep yeah that's me yeah we do get that do yes we do and you got a new game Saturday So uh you'd\nBe asleep by what eight o'clock Saturday Night maybe so but don't make me sound so exciting [laughter]\nThat you feel brother or how you feel Hi\nUh this uh the final closing days of October November is going to\nBe a doozy around here [noise] matter of fact this week may be a doozy when it comes to a\nBig utility here that we not heard much more about this since last week but the of feeling is from sources close to this state circuit court judge that sometime this week he's going to rule the base load ... unconstitutional\nSo this is we get ready for come Thursday the beginning of a month long a set of hearings all day is going to be a jam packed month long we could be yeah\nThey'll start November one we'll see how long ago was do we really need a month to settle this well apparently we need a month just to hear from everybody\n[noise] you get I mean\nYou got the the the state house has got to say and all this you get all these environmental groups that have a say in all this I mean there's a\nWhole bunch of organizations that are going to be up there uh giving testimony laying out their case\nYou know this this is what frustrates the average person the average rate payer that the person who's got a real stake in all this because and we've already heard plenty and and they've already said plenty they've already filed all their\nAll their statements everything they all the evidence that they've taken depositions it's all out there\nAll that's left now is for the lawyers to earn their keep\nAnd the public service commission I don't know how you're feeling about it right now but this is the same group less to members who has that been there to have been replaced but it is rubber stamp all these uh rate hike increases sought\nBy is the energy since they started construction Jenkins we'll\n... it down to this now you have a couple of different options this whatever this ruling and again we can't discount this ruling by the judge\nIf he says the base load would be like is unconstitutional well his latest this past Thursday dominion CEO said you know that's it that changes the terms of our agreement you know part of their agreement to purchase scanner was the you know there's there's no law changes no changes to the law here referring specifically the base load Review Act\nIf the judge says it's unconstitutional it goes by by the millions as late as this past Thursday says they too will go by by\nNow that all that second offer they made last week struck me as a back pedal anyway and I have you know our legislature is certainly not embrace dominion side I don't I don't I'm not even sure why they'd want to be here anymore and apparently\nFrom what I hear over the state house or they're not real keen on this a plan B that diminishes rolled out last week either so yeah of course you know again as we talked about last week I mean you know has to worry about ... you know make your plays the public\nSo while a view of the the the rank and file rate payer would look at that said don't wait a minute I was kind of a thousand dollars back now you're saying\nWell maybe not well doesn't matter what you think now it's all in the hands of the ... and ...\nIt gives them something else to consider so what's at stake here\nHow much and for how long\nWill rate payers continue to pay for the boondoggle\nYou're going to have a lot of groups this of next month to testify the whole thing should be just given back not only should the entire surcharge be taken away\nWhich again is on an average twenty seven dollars a month for the average as the engine customer but that the two billion dollars already collected should be given back\n\nNow or the or is there a proposed cuts would have the typical as the Angie rate payer paying about twelve hundred eighty bucks total over the course of the next two decades or so that's one option\nWas I guess that's the second option if [laughter] if the environmental groups and others a are you know get their way the whole thing goes away and the two billion dollars gets refund it so that's option one or as his option\nNoam do know that two billion dollars comes back we would still continue to pay if you're an assay Angie rate payer over the next two decades twelve hundred eighty bucks total doing it has now two plans originally thousand dollar rebate refund whatever you want to call it\nPay off whatever and about three thousand dollars total over the next Twenty years now under their plan B would you not get a thousand dollar on average refund\nThe rate would be further reduced to a just a percentage point less than it is right now\n\nRight now we're temporarily saving about twenty bucks a month on average there's would have a say just a little less than that\nBut total you'd be paying three thousand dollars total over the next Twenty years and of course then there's the scan option\nWhich would\nHave a customer paying a roughly Seventy five hundred dollars total over the Next Fifty years\n\nWhere's this thing gonna wind up here and you know I mean\nMost most of us rate payers for all these years we know very little about these commissioners open public service commission they're not elected by us they are appointed\n\nAnd they got a lotta a lotta stuff together here over the course of the next to my maybe full month here before they make their decision come December now another little wrinkle in all this happened on friday when we found out friday afternoon it's anti coup or keep in mind same to you but the
