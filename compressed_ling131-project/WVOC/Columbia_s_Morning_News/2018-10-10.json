lot of wind a lot of rain as Michael passes by the good news is is a very bad storm on friday a whole different site texture eighty degrees bright sunshine and by the weekend temperatures were falling\nIn the seventies silo Ryan and the ABC Columbia why does that [noise]\nUh right now we've got some rain falling in Seventy five at the airport Seventy four uptown hearing news radio five

morning for well tumble easily a slow drive in with the rain falling there'll be this way now for a couple of days for us\nAll things to to Michael as update you again or we're Fox to go to the latest that it's now a category for\nA\nThis for the second time and just do a lot less than a month theater where we're talking about the storms of epic proportions\nAre this one different in many ways from Florence of course which was a category one is it a made landfall and was a big rain maker a slow moving this we're gonna move fast but boy is it packing a punch\nMy goodness\nGreat concerns this morning for folks along the panhandle of Florida\nAs this thing makes it so it makes its approach and its impacts later today as a category for hurricane which is pretty unheard of uh this late in the season in that part of the world or any part of the world for that matter\nAt least as far as we're concerned here in the U.S a hundred and forty miles an hour maximum sustained wins which means there are gusts that are higher than that\nUm\nI Would expect this they're probably around the I wall you're probably going to find at least gusts momentary gusts that probably would be the equivalent of a category five\nThe U.S effort Simpson scale and the national Hurricane Center they talk about a category ... storm which is a hundred and thirty two hundred and fifty six mile an hour winds well built framed homes can sustain severely damaged or damage that is what a loss of most\nOf the roof structures some exterior walls catastrophic damage residential areas being cut off by trees in our polls that have come down months long outages possible that's a category for\nThis is a bad one\nOr appears though most people if the warnings that have gotten out but not all have and some people are gonna be stuck for an awfully long time assuming they survive this thing or the Big Bend area of Florida the storm surge now they're talking about nine to Thirteen feet\nFor areas that are at sea level\nThis is going to bring just incredible damage\nOr to that part of a a a Florida in South Georgia and because it's coming on so strong ah you're this thing going inland is going to remain a hurricane and and hit areas that have maybe never seen a hurricane before at least of this this particular strength\nSo that's what it is coming for a for the pan handle later today\nThe initial impact already being felt now for us here\nOur timeline is that we're looking at ah probably about a by eight o'clock tomorrow morning if not sooner will be feeling a the impacts of this storm again we're getting the rain today off and on and that's kind of the outer very outer bands of all this\nUh but the real the real show begins for us uh tonight\nWith tropical storm force winds possible or will a quarter the national weather service here tonight we had to eighty percent chance of rain or not a whole lot quarter of a half inch possible so\nThat spur today actually by the night of rainfall total of a half to three quarters of an inch of possible there tomorrow is a is the big event for us with rain and excessive four inches so all told what about the four to six inch rainfall category right now\n\nThe tropical storm watch Bruce just mentioned in effect for Lexington county and the way that was Lexington a I'm a can ban bird and host of others that's been upgraded now as a as a just a few minutes ago now that tropical storm watch has turned into a tropical storm warning\nThat covers aging Calhoun Claritin lead Lexington Richland\nAnd uh Sumter county's um\nThat is an upgrade from a watch to a warning the watch meaning that conditions are favorable the warning meaning that yeah you were gonna get tropical storm force winds within the next thirty six hours in addition to a tropical storm warning been issued for Chesterfield an edge field Fairfield crush of Lancaster\nMcCormick Newberry and saluted counties\nSo uh that's that's new for you there so basically all the midlands now is Andre tropical storm warning as we look for a tropical storm force winds up possibly forty five mile an hour winds and guests or through the day tomorrow\nSo that's that's the big story here uh we uh found out yesterday we had some schools that had already decided to close up shop a Orangeburg they're going to be on the right side of the storm uh\nTheir uh their districts have have shut down\nA Calhoun County schools will dismiss their students earlier today they'll be closed tomorrow now there were no announcements yesterday from Richmond election in a county school districts I gotta sneaking suspicion here the debts coming today\nI Would expect that uh you know they'll probably be closing up shop to more and more than likely again of the good news is this is a fast mover so by friday [laughter]\nOr whatever it leaves behind it will be like they'd never happen that we look for the return for a sunny skies at a very nice day friday and through the weekend we got to get through this first and the tomorrow is going to be the big day for us so [noise]\nUh falling we're joined said on this morning it tell us more about this thing the attract still has it coming right over the midlands or again\nThat's good we we don't want this thing to shift any further west and it was a little wobble in the morning shift a little more west where does it makes its approach but we don't want to shifting any further west 'cause that would put us here in the middle of the right side of the storm already\nSome parts of the middle of like Orangeburg counting all are on the right side of the storm that's not where you want to be especially the not the right front quarter of course [noise]\nSo that's the big news today we've got an a number of big news stories will get to\nAs we work our way through this morning with your uh the surprise yesterday that Nikki Haley is uh like giving up for a job as the U.S ambassador to the United nations says

down further what's changed for us here if anything will get to in our eyes so yesterday uh finally came out a\n... and the bit unprecedented for a a secret grand jury to actually released a report or this is the past ... grand jury two things here with this um number one which in my opinion should be the leading this although it's not and we'll get to all that\nUm you have five institutions in our state here\nThat uh the the grand jury concluded that there was probable cause that each of them violated state law\nOr these five institutions while admitting no wrongdoing agreed to pay a total of three hundred and fifty two thousand dollars to help with the cost of the investigation yeah I Love how the\nThe various spokespeople for these agencies came up and said well we we didn't want to go through that we didn't want to take these organizations through the cost of defending ourselves so we just went ahead and paid so I'm not\nEven really a slap on the wrist here it's just a okay or in the palmetto help pays about a hundred thousand dollars us he pays nine the scanner pay Seventy two without a TNT sixty thousand the trial lawyers thirty thousand\nOr a drop in the proverbial bucket and business goes on as usual for them\nWell it's not supposed to that's the point of releasing this report ... yes yeah yeah that's right the we're all they're all ... clients are ... are they say on but it does to them they didn't know that uh the Quinn from head lawmakers on its payroll\nSo I didn't realize that they were doing something wrong here well of the report does you know go into some more detail and all this ... which is kind of an interesting read there\nSo you know after what five years now\nWe get\nA ... a couple of indictments we still got the Harris and try to go to this month right\n[noise] but basically things wrapped up here and Tracy edge I think is still indicted okay trace yet um\n[noise] listen [noise]\nWe go back to the beginning of all this and this is the other part of the story here uh Alan Wilson to gauge the if you'll recall when this all started\nHeaded I handed I'm David past go Bobby heroes hit on a platter the eighties office started that investigation basically than just a you know when when Wilson recused himself from that\nAnd pass through without his first choice but we wound up with basketball the Democrat winds up uh with the heroin diamond\nYou\nWere in it so much time has passed now the Bobby Harrell is eligible to run for office again and there's some speculation that he might do that although he decided not to at least not for now so you've really got not a whole lot to show for this and now you're\nGoing to wrap it up with you know ... of of of thousands here I Am going to interrupt you hear me okay because you've spent the past year telling us just how important and how powerful the Clintons were ... so how do you say now that this didn't get anything done\nWell it got it got them done OK okay um\nSo you're ... you're right now the speaker of the house the most powerful man and governmental yeah but and and make the most powerful political agency in town\nTrue okay I grant you that but\n[laughter] I'm already indictments if we had the one of those people were surprised that although the Quinn dynasty now is shattered\nAnd it'll never be revived a people were shocked that you know Pascoal made this deal with the ... as far as you know doing any jail time or anything else\nBut let's get the other side of this story here and what I've been saying now all year long\nIs this politically motivated we know that it's only been Republicans and truth of the matter is that most all of queens clients were Republicans I think the only Democrat was the Benjamin that I'm aware of\nAs far as politicians are concerned um\nSo I've been saying all along you know ... if we get to the to the primaries in the past and suddenly you know another indictment drops than we are going to know this thing is politically motivated well what we saw yesterday in this report\nOf this\nWell he's absolutely terrible\nTerrible how to ... to ... ... how he's doing a job because of the players so far and it was\nA
