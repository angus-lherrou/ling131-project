back a Wednesday [noise] All right uh\nLet's get right to it ah\nThis morning we're right back to where we were a couple of weeks ago no not capital that's taking care of but we'll get to the aftermath of all that is that a vote was taken Saturday afternoon fifty to forty ... confirmed Kevin ... now to the Supreme Court he begins a tomorrow\nHe'll have his birthday on the bench tomorrow but we're right back to where we were a couple of weeks ago talking about tropical weather is a kind of just mentioned there and the update looking at Michael\nHere's what we need to know about Michael right now we'll talk to John Farley the chief meteorologist ABC Colombian eight o'clock out this morning to get more details and his take on this but ah right now as of the five AM update\nYes Michael is now a tropical storm\nIt got that are as Bruce mentioned it got that status uh yesterday\nUh picked up a some momentum here as far as when speed is concerned uh Seventy mile an hour maximum sustained winds so Seventy four would make it a hurricane's just about their\nAim was moving yesterday about three miles an hour movie about seven miles an hour now are the good news is they expect the thing that move a lot quicker than Florence they're not just stall out but again the bad news is it does the current five dead code of uncertainty has his truck coming right over the midlands\nSo let's look at this thing or expect to become a hurricane probably um later today next update I think is not going to be until eleven o'clock I don't think they're doing an eight am but we'll keep an eye on it\nBut probably becoming a hurricane today expected to make landfall right as a about a category ... storm in the panhandle of Florida this track has moved a little further to the east or\nVersus what they were thinking yesterday now the further east it moves and I'm the meteorologist but just before I think we're all kind of at least a [noise]\nYou know layperson meteorologist these days with the experience that we've had here we know we don't want to be in the right side of the storm so the five day track right now has it coming right up through the ... which is not really a bad thing that keeps us off that right hand especially that right front quadrant track\nSo the further east it moves the better for us we want to be on the left side of this storm none of the right side that's not good news though for the coastal areas\nAre from ... a flood prone Charleston up the ah seaboard into places that got hit very hard by Florence or the grand strand and the pd um again the difference in this one is it's expected to move a lot quicker\nBy the time it impacts us it should be a tropical storm and get a little lost its hurricane status by that point in time of course that won't take long was it makes landfall or to lose those characteristics and to lose some Muslim wind speed but here's what we're watching it now for later on this week\nUh again the time of arrivals the national Hurricane Center says the earliest reasonable time of a rival for tropical storm wins for us\nWould be a Wednesday nights the most likely is going to be more like Thursday morning although there are some models out there that particular thing to slow down a little bit and maybe push us into friday before we get a tropical storm force to type a weather out here\nThe a tropical storm force winds probabilities for us here in the middle of those who are worried about a a ...\nForty or fifty percent chance that we get a tropical storm force winds which is defined by the national Hurricane Center is you know Augusta at least thirty nine miles an hour for a minute or more\nSo we could be looking at that the rainfall totals always a concern certainly uh right now the way to look at it this thing is for us we're kind of on the\nBorder of a ... called two to four inches so that we can handle certainly that's not a big problem for us although it was quickly that falls that could be a flash flooding issue certainly in certain parts of town that we're all too well aware of\nBut that's what we're watching so a couple of days of keeping an eye on this thing a Wednesday maybe Thursday maybe even friday at the latest will be impacted by Michael\nHere on the eighth of October we get to another a room for weeks or three weeks or so of hurricane season although that's just a day on the calendar\nDoesn't really mean anything as we all know so Michael up front and center the fair starts Wednesday this is not good news for the fair [noise]\nOf course as a cranks up so the first couple of days or can be a little a little little dicey over there and I was just looking ahead here you know my my my theory is always by the second week of the fair fall arrives we may actually get a little bit sooner here\nIf this holds up because once the storm moves through it on out of here I we're looking at temperatures longer the seven day here by the weekend highs seventies Lowe's and the upper fifty so\nThey were not too far away from all that let's hope so [noise] alright to quickly or some other things that we're going to follow and talk about here on this Monday morning broadcast or as up tomorrow will be four weeks away\nFrom the mid term elections and that at least the state newspaper doing a lot of stories over the weekend\nAbout uh the

lot idea so Here's Michael ... the ATM update out still a tropical storm but it's almost in hurricane status let's start with what's happening right now his work our way towards the the rest of the week and what it brings for us what are you looking at\n... yeah so this so that that the storms out you know it's it's in the Gulf ... you know and that's expected to move to the north\nUm and ah intense buys it does because what's in the Gulf conditions are are favorable for for this thing to get stronger so\nAs it comes to the north of them you know I don't expect a thing to get at least you know category one to maybe maybe stronger but but it's very difficult to know how strong it'll get you know the good thing is prepared for everything um and then landfall or somewhere along the north slope or\nThe panhandle of Florida so anywhere from basically you know as far west as mobiles bar and maybe even if the Tallahassee too so um that's that's the code of where this thing's going to make landfall sometime\nI'm Wednesday now unlike Florence this one looks like it's a little easier to forecast here than foreign was I guess yeah I\nYeah and and also the other thing is is once they get\nOnce it once it gets to the you know to the to the to the states I'm there will be much stronger steering cards for this and it's so it's going to be moving along quickly and as a result um you know I don't see anything like the rainfall amounts that came out of Florence it'll be moving along now you know\nOr you know along the coast of Florida you're still looking at an in any of these tropical situation could be looking at\nYou know maybe eight or ten inches in some in some spots but again this thing\nDoes not look like in any way it's going to stole so as long as that keeps moving that would do it and then for us we're looking at a pretty rainy day on Thursday a with you know maybe you know two to four inches of rain ... sort of thing and that would be pretty widespread that would be really from the upstate low country are pretty good swat the brain\nOkay well two to four certainly here in the middle as we can handle that\nYes no not yet a big deal wind speeds tropical storm force winds speech for us\nYeah I Would say I would say especially for the thing will be moving along pretty good I Would say you know I you know just a forty or maybe even a little bit better the other thing and I know that that that whenever used the term tornado people get freaked out but I'm\nOn the right side of these storms as they come in or we gotta watch out for tornadoes now I Want to I Want to make a big distinction between\nThe Kansas tornadoes that we see that these ... you know half mile wide\nYou're on the ground for an hour and you know just\nJust the destruction versus these tropical system tornadoes\nThe tropical system tornadoes when they when they come in they spin up really quickly they go down really quickly and that's not to say that the tornado isn't dangerous but I'm just trying to say that that this would be on the low end of of a tornado scale but we do have to watch out for them\nAs they come in on the right side as this thing ... so I Would say anywhere on the right side of the storm as a ...\nTo the things we can say well one thing we can say for sure you know you ... and things don't go well\nYou would least go down you to be in the in the ... yeah you ... you feel comfortable bringing ... in number two and this is just a guess on my part but if scar nephew winds up starting that game for whatever the reason or playing a lot of it for whatever reason and pulls up one or Texas a and M. right\nThen what do you do 'cause you gotta buy week I'm not even sure you have a controversy anymore I Do I Would think he would start against
