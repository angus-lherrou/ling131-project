October twenty six [noise] my name is Gary David Christopher Thompson is\nWith us tumble weighed Bruce and Farley\nThe uh second this fall debate last night between governor Henry McMaster [noise]\nThen state representative\nJames Smith playing out up in Greenville the uh by the way the lieutenant governors like the candidates debate\nMonday that'll be interesting uh you've got to Mandy a a powers Noel who's been in the state house and then a Pamela Abbott who's never sought public office uh\nWe'll see how that plays out you know somebody who's never had an experience on debates days before like that or she made it a bit of high school I don't know but that will be interesting\nInteresting thing to see their ... but but last night for a first I got a question here maybe you know the answer to this both these debates have been set up the same Charles ... the moderator and the only other person asking questions ah Andy Shane from post and courier did the post ... they sponsor these debates\nI asked him so I don't know why nobody else asking questions I don't know but but regardless that an ATV\nYeah uh what I found interesting to start that debate last night and I'm trying to remember who ran the article was it the state or the post and courier about McMaster's\nRental property it was the post and courier ... of course it was because Andy Shane quoted it\nYeah All right so again just just keeping in mind the the the backdrop here in the days leading up to this debate you have the story that both the state and the post and courier ran\nOriginally a Daily Caller a story about a James Smith and the Congo regroup is one man a outfit there and that he had been blacklisted by the the VA for ... well the point and getting it all that but so you have\nAnd you is going to come up last night but so it was what I guess a day before the debate the post and courier and the story on the governor's rental properties get trying to level the playing field a little bit there so the first question from Shane last night was about those two things\nWell he he he put it in the context of small business operating small business in South Carolina but then he zeroed in on both of them with a question\nRight so the deal with the McMaster rental properties was a or they they they ran up a piece in some pictures of one of these properties that was the most state of disrepair what a cock roaches are ... imagine that\nMould mould ... so so that was opposed to the governor last night about the state of the living conditions and uh and and the least in some of these properties\nBut we we rent to people they're sold a weekly basis that's all they can afford and uh they they are a lot of these people would be on the street if we didn't have a place for all that\nOkay so that responses are I but uh again is Bruce ... of the update you've got at least one of the political pundits funded ... last night uh who said I guess a couple of them it took issue with the fact that the governor went on to say that was his wife who's in charge of those properties\nYeah the audio you just played he was telling him a specific ... apparently he called it a boarding house I didn't know we still operate boarding houses we're rentals yeah All right so he was talking about that but yeah he started his answer by saying well you know my wife's in charge now [laughter]\nI I mean it it almost had the same ring to it as in the first debate when they asked what do you want to do with how do you want to get more money out of the Senate and he said you give us some ... hey yeah yeah it it almost had that same tone\n... yeah it did now a service his response to ah the the his business the Congo regrouping are losing their ability to do work with the Veterans Administration\nThey require that I'll be fulltime and gays in the business and the fact is running a fulltime statewide campaign and serving as governor you can't do both so it was a voluntarily intent to let that go and begin winding up that business\nWas that's the response will be expected in his what his campaign said and when that story first broke a couple of days back\nOr so but but that's the way they started things last night now\nActually the governor started things in his opening statement\nBy saying he was getting ready to cut the employment by fifty two million dollar yes which I mean right out of the gate you know hitting a key Republican issue which I thought was pretty smart but it just\nIt was almost too fast you I mean you weren't even settled in your seat with your popcorn yet and he'd already throwing that out there and it was almost he threw it out there so fast and then he ... he breezed right past it\nYeah and I did come up again later the debate it did when we're about to ask you about how would that work in this and that and and I don't have the clip unfortunately but the governor responded to ... the moderator as\nIs his line of reasoning and how that why that wouldn't worry that well that that's a that's a democratic thing right there\nSo he took a shot at the Charles ... our last night with that\nHe was he was making clear comparisons all night and and that's one of the reasons why you brought up the tax cut he wanted to make it clear that you are here I Am a conservative Republican in the state of South Carolina here's the other side and he he included the moderator and that ... and the other side\nThe facts are not paying any attention to critics after a disappointing start to the season\nWe have high expectations to our players
