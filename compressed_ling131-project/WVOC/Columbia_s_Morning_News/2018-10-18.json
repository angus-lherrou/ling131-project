about last night's debate that was held in Florence the the first debate between the\nGovernor McMaster\nAK a Henry James Smith we we I Wish somebody could go through to account of how many times representative Smith refer to the governor's Henry last night\nHe never called them governor\nThere was always Henry I think he did work in a sort of one time um that was about it but uh well\nGuns taxes schools higher education K. through twelve education Obamacare it'll global warming mixed in there\nA little bit of everything last night and it it didn't take long it's a matter of fact we'll play some of the audio a little bit later on quarter CBP be who I had that the debate last night it didn't take long at all for Russ Smith to go on to the er into attack mode against the governor\nMatter of fact his his his opening statement this the first couple of words in his opening statement you would after a governor McMaster last night which again you look at a a guy that record the latest polls is trailing by twenty four points\nUh I think that's what he had to do I I was a bit surprised that he was a ... as as well as ... as he was in his attacks against the governor last night\nBut uh no doubt that his campaign has figured out a hands what's gonna have to do\nSo uh winners losers in all everybody's got their opinion will talk about that are coming up this morning as that one was only one more member that's a week from the Knight that'll be up in Greenville at a green book technical college I was going to have to call for this kind of an hour\nOr so we'll get one more chance to see these two debates in ah I don't know that the next one's going to be much different than this would tell you the truth\nUnless something else pops up between now and then I think we'll probably get more of the same question is is it will be enough for Smith to overcome a huge deficit according to the polling uh\nOver the state house to move yesterday apparently the legislature now going to hear some of these buyout offers the governor has been uh been been hoping they would a buyout offers for Sandy Cooper\nA this is a win for the governor certainly um group of legislators met privately for nearly two hours\nOr with a with a firm that has been thinking about it now again I'm Still not clear how this helps us or if it does or not or really who would you be interested in buying that right now in this environment ... we'll see\nBut that's certainly a a feather in the capital governor right there at least some progress is being made on that here's we talk every closer to the midterms yesterday we were telling us that they use a separate superintendent of education race which was brought up last night about how that position should it be the point in the position that elected position as it is and has been\nUm that that was pretty much a done deal\nThat Molly Spearman we we already knew as of yesterday would be the next again back as superintendent of education not die from it was any chance you wouldn't be but the uh the story that came out of the upstate that her opponent the Democrat or Israel Romero well\nAs a felony conviction on his record in sort of time with in the past Fifteen Years and by state law that means he can't serve as an elected official in our state well he has withdrawn now so yeah in fact that's one race you can to strike off the books right there in my spare minute will return\nAs superintendent education also a\nBack into his political a spot ...\n... you may recall was accused of domestic violence the space back two years\nAnd this had to do with a as I recall incident involving a what was his ex wife and the kids at a car in whatever trying to get her out of the car or what have you

be talking a\nQuite a bit about the debate last night the first of just two between Henry McMaster and James Smith the next one is a week from the Knight up in Greenville\nUh [noise]\nWell uh we talked about yesterday what I'm you know the hurdle that James Smith has to overcome your based on the latest polling data\n... again ... pull the polls this ... been pretty accurate as of late a deadly accurate you might say and it has a big metro twenty four points over Smith going into the debate last night\nWe talked yesterday about who needed to do what the governor just needed to make sure he didn't stumble\nDidn't blow anything\nUm Smith needed to well I I said I think he needs to come out on the attack last night and you brought it up and I agree that that's really not his style necessarily\nBut uh but it was last night and it didn't take long not long at all it happened to the opening statement\nFrom each candidate a\nAudio courtesy of the TV or the governor wrapping up his opening statement last night this is what it sounds like\nWe just getting started more people working in ... before the next four years ago even though we're going to win win win\nThank you thank you for having a representative Smith thank you thank you Charles and and and if this is winning I Would hate to see what losing look like they're\n\nSo the first words out of a mouse last night was the oh to attack history which I don't think I I heard one single time last night refer to master as governor\nNo governor no governor McMaster was it was Hillary all night long and I'm guessing that was well when I'm guessing I Know that was a obviously the ... ... ... a tactic used by Smith and his camp last night\nProbably based on the fact that Governor McMaster has never actually been elected governor in our state I don't know I think it's probably just\nEqualing the playing field new and and plus the fact that these two have known each other for you oh yeah long before McMaster became governor right\n... but you did that's I I I don't know how that well let's put it this way it plays to Smith base certainly you will irritate big Massachusetts voters but none of those really matter it's the people in the middle how does it play those folks\nPretty much what we heard last night was um aside from Smith attacking McMaster at every possible moment was Smith needing to try to get out
