sixteen matter of fact he was a very very accurate on a number of races\nOr even including the primaries here so the new Trafalgar a poll that was released yesterday\nIs out and ... we had this back up a couple of weeks because uh the prior one was released about two weeks ago or the first uh grew a poll they did\nA statewide survey was conducted a September twenty fourth through October ... now the dates are important because this was that was pre\nKavanaugh okay in that one it had big master up of fifty point seven percent to thirty six point seven\nPercent so it was a a what a fourteen point lead for the incumbent in that one now they've gone back in and pulled again\nThe dates this time October twelve through the fourteenth so this was last week this was post Kavanaugh and I don't know how much it\nPlays into it if at all but uh I can tell you this a master's lead has his grown fifty five and a half percent dismiss thirty two point one percent\nSo um got a big difference there\n\nI'm trying to do the math on my head real quick what's that ah five and you've got a [noise] what about the twenty three maybe maybe for twenty five to twenty three point lead I'm so this as the two candidates get together tonight for the first time in a debate it at this point of view McMaster gave you might be thinking\nWell maybe he was going to come down with uh with with with a little something and won't be able to make the debate tonight or next Thursday because why bother if you if in fact this poll is great you get that big of a lead\nY or Z and that's going to happen but

was issued was put out\nA ends of the ones that are David ... grand jury was a very critical of attorney general outta Wilson\nA lot of rehash the stuff from from several years ago of course but still it's important to note that this poll taken after the release that grand jury\nAs Wilson up fifty three point two percent to an asset to pull those thirty percent so at twenty three plus percentage point lead for the Republican in that race as well and again the dates are uh\nAre important because it's post the release of that grand jury report which even democratic pundits upset is not going to do Wilson any any harm it all\nWe should probably run down by the way uh you know there are a number of state wide elections offices up on the ballot\nCome November the sixth or addition to the to we

here [noise]\nThe more tofu boarding yeah we're ready for some cooler temperature all\nTotal of polling data this morning just got a brand new poll out yesterday from the Trafalgar group in Atlanta\nPoll of it's been a pretty spot on here as of late which leaves a little more credence to things as a McMaster and Smith getting ready for their first of two debates tonight spruce just mentioned will be friends with marry him up for this one seven o'clock\nYou wanna watch it ATVs got the exclusive on that one\nLet's back up or to some of recent polls are in this race\nWe've only a aside from the internal polling which we don't know what that says the only been four publicly released polls to this point uh the first was back in August\nFiguring heart a yang poll that's the Democrat pulling for the rest of been from Republican leaning polling firms the one in August had a big master it forty seven and Smith at forty three\nNow I Know what you're you're thinking boy that's that's awful tight and yeah I was\nBut in in our states you believe it or not I mean we know the last time around Nikki Haley be been singer he by fourteen points first time around she'll be there for\nA Sanford beat Tommy more back in two thousand six by eleven points you be Jim Hodges who's running as the incumbent in two thousand to buy\nA about six points you'd have to go in the last say Thirty years had to go back to Carol Campbell in Nineteen Ninety four just a landslide\nWe picked up almost Seventy percent of the vote and that was after Hugo when yes Cheryl Campbell was at his most popular yeah he was an incumbent running a actually both times well the first time he ran against ah Michael Daniel\nHe only won by about three percentage points but then a landslide against the mental in Nineteen Ninety so yet typically more often than not these races have been decided by you know four or five points are so so we saw that a Darren heart yang poll\nBack in August and it had a four point advantage we're master\n... it should have been that terribly surprising but what's happened since\nAn outfit called the terrorist group which is a well this this that's commercially by the Republican Governors Association came out um a few days after that a first polling August and had the master with a an eleven point lead fifty two forty one\nSince then two things that happen McMaster's leaders increased and the number of undecideds went up a bit as well the Trafalgar group in their poll a couple of weeks ago\nAnd the dates are important here because the uh first fabric poll was taken September twenty fourth through October second\nEbbing Bastrop fifty one thirty seven that was pre Kavanaugh\nThe poll they released yesterday taken October twelve through fourteenth post Kavanaugh and by the way a about doubling the sample size the biggest sample size to date of any of these polls nearly five thousand respondents\nHas McMaster now at fifty six to thirty two with twelve percent undecided\nWe if that poll is accurate\nAnd if this is the way it comes down on November the six that will be a ... would be the biggest margin of course you get twelve is undecided there you have to think undecided did they actually go and pull the lever\nYou're this point they're probably going for the Democrat maybe not maybe not\nYeah I I I Would tend to lean the other way I Would think undecided would probably if they're still not sure on election day go with what they know go with what they know and that's good if they see the income but they're they recognize Henry McMaster dumb pull his lover\nGood boy so you know based on this polling data this would indicate that this money will be the the biggest landslide we've seen going all the way back to Nineteen Ninety\n\nIt's a pretty large spread right they they also of the first time have polled the attorney general's race and again the dates were important always opposed Kevin uh this is posted grand jury report that was released in which Pascoal was critical of Alan Wilson\nOr it has Wilson at fifty three point two percent Kansas and asked the polo at thirty\nPercent now again in in this state\nWhen you just ... you know when you're on the ballot as a Republican or Democrat there's kind of a baseline or as a Republican the baseline is about forty five percent as a Democrat the bass line this close to forty percent yeah we're a we're a red state\nBut it's\nIt's it's usually closer than you than you think it would be and you think oh yeah the Republicans got Seventy thirty advantage of any race not it's not really that way the baseline for Democrats about forty percent and that's the lowest point gets thirty percent\n\nSo according this poll Wilson has a very comfortable lead over an effort to pull up\nSo now tonight\nAnd uh again next Thursday in Greenville the uh the two gubernatorial candidates meet so if you're in ... in in Henry has a ... we had him on what about two weeks ago\nYou can you can just ... years it's uncanny ability of killing time [noise] you ... you could ask you something that he can go it's like it's like listening to adapt those when you press
