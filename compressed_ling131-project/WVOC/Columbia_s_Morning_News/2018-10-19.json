details and their take on that coming up just a couple of minutes or more bad news coming down when it comes to education in our state\nWhen's the last time we have any good news if we ever on we talk about it all I Know they they banned the about a debate about it and they spend money on this money on that but the ... much seems to change around here\nAre worried that the graduating class of twenty Eighteen in our state came next to last\nWhen it came to the ACT college readiness test the\nOnly state that did worse um\nNevada this time around ... ... you know here's here's part of the rub though if you asked me I'm not all states max but I've had my most states do not require that students\nTake the ACT uh here in South Carolina it's typically at the end of the junior year in high school students sit for this test um but we require every student to take it\n\nAgain most don't so this is a little apples and oranges\nTo a degree here or in a state that doesn't require students to take this test well who do you think taking it\nThe ones that are you planning to go to college probably kids did pretty good grades near the top of their class they're going to take the ACT\nAre kids that have no designs on further education after high school or maybe they want to go to a tech school or in a trade or whatever\nThey're probably not taking this test in most states in the country here in South Korea doesn't matter what your post high school plans are you being told you got to take this test\nWell\nOkay [laughter] that's kind of an important a little qualifier there I\nHowever when you look at the um Seventeen states that do require all their students to take the test well doggone it we'd come and sixteenth place\n[laughter]\nAnd as usual there are disparities amongst school districts um the ones that did the best or your\nFor Lexington five followed by your to Lexington one Charleston county in Dorchester can so there's always\nYou know that seem to always be the case and there are wide disparities when it comes the ethnicity or when it comes to the achievement gap was other states only five percent of African American students\nMet three or more of the benchmarks sixty percent of Hispanics ... thirty three percent of white students so it is really a problem across all ethnicities but it's certainly worse for some than others\n\nI I don't know uh [laughter] it's anybody have an answer for this\nWe haven't had an answer in a while I mean we talk about teaching to the test and teachers getting tired of that but I mean this is this is not just teaching to a test this is teaching to being ready for college\nAnd I mean as as much as I get I I'm In I'm not sure what the problem is because my kids are in one of those school districts that does everything they can to make sure these kids are reading and I I get that I'm I'm One of the advantaged I don't see what the problem is\n\nBut then as you mentioned I mean we've got these districts where the money's not there the resources aren't there computers aren't there\n\nAnd it's a different ballgame for them\nWell to questions what did these other states know that we don't when it comes to preparing these students to take\nThese tests I got a ... when when when our kids were in high school I always seemed like once you got to about ... you'll be in the end of April or so you know all class room learning ceased\nAnd then it was all about taking standardized\nTest whatever what whatever grade level you are in it was all about you know All right we've got a new ... the last time focusing on the standardized test we got to take\nThey need to take this test if you know your kid's not going to go to college why should we can't take the ... are they going to care are they going to\nGive a darn when it comes to preparing for this test they got no designs to you know go on to college and get a four year degree afterwards\nNothing wrong with that\nWhy don't we requiring a hundred percent of our students to take it to begin with I I don't know\nMaybe it's that outdated thought that everybody needs to go to college and hopefully you encourage enough people if you make them take the test maybe they think All right maybe this is a path I should follow because I mean that used to be the thought process that everybody's got to go to college ... used to be\nNot so much anymore\nSo I yeah anyway I was just another uh another one of these ah rankings when it comes to education that we're ah they least we're not dead last rebel ... whatever that's worth\nOur forward in ... and that's sports you're on WB you'll see we're going to decide Tamar ... a bit of some serious tailgate now they're no doubt about it yeah ... ... fans around here and sitting on their thumbs

from somebody about putting gun ring on your homes sake that quote and then call Stacy must go out and you're going to find that in most cases the quote you get from Doug in his folks is about half of what the other guys\nI Know what you're saying okay yeah it's half because this has some kind of inferior product oh no all states the most got her a these folks to the standards that they have when
