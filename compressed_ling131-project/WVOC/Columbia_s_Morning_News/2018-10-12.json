fourteen a beautiful weekend coming our way thank you Mother Nature we deserve it by gone right we do everybody deserves it yeah I I just I still I mean we were so\nYou know stuck in the you know worried about what this thing was going to bring around here we didn't really get a [noise] I at least didn't get a good chance of yesterday afternoon when the sun came out here to take a look at the pictures from the panhandle I mean just on\nBelievable just devastation and ... here it's just been a strange couple of weeks because you know we had this slow ramp up to Florence and it I mean there was anxiety this bill the anxiety that we weren't quite ready and then it kind of went out with a whimper at least in the middle ends\nAnd then there's this\nStorm Michael was virtually ignored around here and then all of a sudden what we need to be worried about this\nI think a lotta people slept on that one but you know it was all said and done why we had a couple of issues but nobody edge around here but that the [noise] I just\nIt's so unbelievable how something like that can bring a I I wrote it pales in comparison what happened in the panhandle but I mean we had flooding up into Virginia yesterday\nFrom that storm just unreal now the store and get ready to go into town Bernie Sanders\nA week from tomorrow or burning will be at the ... center\nUh he's been invited by the or the group our revolution South Carolina\nThis is a group that uh uh grew out of his twenty sixteen the presidential a bed and a group that has endorsed James Smith for governor\nBut Smith will be as far away from the ... center next Saturday as he can be\nA this will be a Medicare for all rally\n\nA Bernie a back during the primaries got twenties five twenty six percent of the vote here it's all going to think what\n\nAnd I don't will there be any Democrats that are running for office in the midterms weather for the first time or for reelection\nWill there be anybody that shows up to this thing why would they I mean it would probably be more damaging and and to be fair he's not a Democrat but he's a different than when he wants to be in\nIts you know [laughter]\nThis is just a ... it is truly a selfish gesture or an ape and he claims while I was invited to some ... of course I'm going to come but this is this is really selfish to hurt the party that you associate yourself with when it's convenient knowing you're going to hurt that party when you visit\nYour short of Donald Trump coming back to the states sometime over the course of the next less than four weeks now to a campaign for Henry McMaster short of that this is the best thing that could happen to the governor quite honestly\nAnd they're they're uh they're taking all the advantage they can of this or the governor's campaign releasing a digital ad\nThat I'm among other things shows those ... points out that this group our revolution is endorsing James Smith now obviously Smith you you can't control who endorsed it who doesn't\nKnow you'll take all the votes you can get\nBut you don't want to talk about that one\nI met again Smith the only way he has a chance to win is is to run as a as a as a moderate here as a centrist\nUm\nEven though the Republicans will tell you the guy's anything but that but\nThis is the tactic if you're going to want to try to win that that that seat in this state you got to have to be\nA moderate Democrat when it's been a while since we've had one when it\nThis is the same thing Vincent sheen tried twice against Nikki Haley was a moderate Democrat it didn't work either time\nBut he got them within four percentage points the first time not close to the last time matter of fact the last race this year he lost a Haley by fourteen points which was the same spread we saw in this recent for fabric poll that came out within the last week\nSo this is not helpful for the Smith campaigner for any Democrat running for office here in South Carolina\nAnd among the clips they've released as ... and this is a digital led by the governor is a a clip at a campaign event in which an audience member asks Smith would you support Medicare for all\nWhich of course is what our revolution and Bernie Sanders are uh are are hoping for\n\nA year and the clip\nThe reaction from Smith and I'm quoting absolutely\nNow keep in mind that in terms of universal healthcare there's only so much a governor can do a lot of that has to be determined by federal legislation but I certainly believe in it I've been to countries that can do that and I certainly believe America can do it as well\n\nNow a Smith camp says that uh he did not support the Medicare for all proposal\nBut it's it's kinda tough to say when you get to that clip on tape right there yeah what's their explanation that he misunderstood the question I don't know or maybe he's had a change of heart or ... I'm not real sure\nAnd now you gotta you gotta play four quarters tomorrow is going to be beautiful out there though\nAnd Texas a and M. loves to hold the football for long periods of time\nAnd then as soon as the Jodi fences that's not a good thing [noise]\nSo bad doesn't happen right there and I write seven thirty one now is the picket ... believe it or not yes a few Black Friday deals and it's that time but give them commando chatting about that in a few minutes Bruce by the way as a resident Texas and then fan of the mission divulge that right now but he is he'll be by the update our top stories here\nIn just a couple of minutes lifetime cabinets and counter tops I just had such a great experience working with a with Marcus and the Casey Alexander the gang over lifetime Kevin ... we upgraded our bathroom counter tops a couple of months back\nThere are a lot of differences when it comes to working with lifetime cameras and countertops or they don't just sell you the countertops or they are of the experts in consultation and design they've got their own in house fabrication\nShop they do all the work right there at their shape and location or watch the the the equipment they got out there but let's put it this way lifetime chemistry how tough they do everything they stock and sell the countertops all those big old slabs row after row after row at it they're shaping location\nThey all sweaty location or closer to town if you're in the ... and the Colombian formed in a robe\nBut the you know the stock and they sell them they do all the work on fabricating them putting the finishes on a cutting them do it to the size to fit your existing countertops leaving the owner markets comes out and personally measures to counter tops on each job they do no matter how big or how small to make sure that exact fit because they do everything\nAnd yes uh when somebody shows up to install them it's somebody who works for lifetime caps on countertops no third party contractors involved in any step in the process\nLifetime cameras tops I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy doing business with the same way that we had you could see them on Facebook and take a look at all the pictures of the wonderful jobs they've done just look for lifetime cameras and counter tops there on line their lifetime cameras S.
