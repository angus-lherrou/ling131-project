C. club for growth which is a conservative free markets advocacy group they did this poll\nIs trying to figure out what people thought about a potential sales Santa ... the governor of course has been wanting to do from the get go\n\nUm but ... couple of things they found out among people who live in this state who are not St Cooper customers\nFifty percent of people in the poll didn't even know the Santa ... owned by the state [laughter] had no idea what's this\n... thing\nAnd that of those surveyed how many people were aware of what's been going on has been been hosed now for a year after year after year with these rate hikes in ... why would they are electricity bills going up they just I just thought well it's just when you look at the bills go up\nForty eight percent of people in the survey where we're not at all familiar with what happened out and drink Israel\nAnd I don't know if they just didn't know that they they were building up an expanding the plan to begin with or they didn't know what it collapsed I I don't know how you don't hear something about that but then again\nForty eight percent were unfamiliar with what happened in Janesville another twelve percent weren't real sure\nSo that's sixty percent only forty percent of people in the survey knew what was going on that was that\nNow part of the the the problem with is is that the people they surveyed\nTwenty five percent of them were Duke Energy customers that's gonna ... you know that that all these years later the survey yeah I don't know what percentage of people in our state are getting their power from Duke Energy but I don't think it's twenty five percent I could be wrong\nI think it's less than that but I Love to double check that are twenty nine percent of survey we're getting their power from Massey Energy twelve percent from Santa Cooper another Twenty one percent from the electric co ops who I'm sure they probably weren't even aware that you like your co ops are buying the bulk of the energy from Santa Cooper\nWhich was the minority partner in this whole debacle\nSo you know [laughter] [noise] all said and done\nEven people who were getting their electricity from Santa Cooper and the co ops only forty six percent so they were familiar with the busy summer melt down that was it\n\nOh okay well\nThe public service commission needs to make a decision Myrtle I Know more than two and a half months away from figuring out what they're going to do here which where they're going to rule on all this\nAnd I'm not again I\nI guess I shouldn't be shocked that that many people were totally unaware of what's going on here now the post and courier put other piece over the weekend or\nThat according to newly released emails shows that some of scandalous top executives some who we're no longer with the company some who's still or\n\nDid not want to wish you all knew this of course but they didn't even want now regulators investors to know about this Bechtel report\nThey get the report\nPretty much immediately said well okay we gotta we gotta sit on this thing and the scan executives according to the emails put the pressure on fancy Cooper to also tried to bury this report\n\nThey did not want anybody to know about it in particular they didn't want to Wall Street investors know about this thing\n\nA quarter the post and courier James won the fourth a scan exact who signed off on the company's financial statements just downplayed the significance of all of it\n\nSaying that back to that was only being paid a million dollars and that scan esteemed believe the analysis was unlimited\nBut this was the report well at least maybe twenty five percent of people are state are aware of [laughter] only maybe fewer than that so the report was
