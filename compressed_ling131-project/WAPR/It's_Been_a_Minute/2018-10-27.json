something but there was one that had Idaho have a nasty light as the favorite candles\n[laughter]\nNettie light [laughter] All right\nLet's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy uh movies yes\nWas difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nAgain and we need to miserable people\nThere was another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girl private love letters from mysteriously males to all of her crushes I think it's really cool that you\nThink I have golden spent my eyes\nTo literature out then there was this\nOther one where the bride got left at the altar so then she went on our honeymoon with her estranged father\nGot incredibly drunk that night and I blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what the grammar hunting though the fun thing\nAbout all these movies are that these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved before and like ... have you ever watch any of those movies\nTwo out of three okay which to I watched um televised I Love before of course so good and set it up yes letter I used to love lovely\nFeel retro about them I feel I feel like it's stoke that particular part of my heart same\nSame so these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch them any comedies on the streaming service\nThey even had a name for this big push they called it the summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that tens of millions of people watch these movies across the world this summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about that\nSome of the data out and it turns out that tens of millions of people watch these movies across the world is summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering this summer of love very closely\nHer name is Gwen I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talk all about it\nHey Glenn how are you good how are you doing I'm good I'm thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having named super excited yet I have been kind of\n... out for several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer\nI Know you didn't even now [noise] um\nThey called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA that as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four or five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight eight million people watching these rom coms [laughter] my big question and first question about all of this was like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen the movie studios and like the box office not really take the rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix say well this might work for us\nThink they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd comic book crossing offshoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible ... infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians the summer you kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms are also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that\nThis is the first movie they directed or they've directed like TV episodes before they're adapting way novels they're finding creative forces that really have been under used and it's worked out really well for them yeah why have the big\nMovie studios at the movies in theaters why they left rom coms\nWrit large I think they're uh they're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars bat\nGym with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when you grand and Julia Roberts you could just basically put your grand with anybody like let's ... up next why not ... but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon and Vince vaughan and for Christmases and the tank and these are super stars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls re runs again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms genre and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do is spend twenty dollars and see a lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone [laughter]\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going on to\n'em should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\nMovie like that to see you later and and the the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters and cause the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like ...\nPrevalent we had a ton of commenters and because the question is like well why did eighty million people watch this like what is the big question I mean other than like markets or whatever people are just like we're depressed word\nJoined the friends of W A L and help with the ... public radio joined afternoon of good food beer trivia and music with proceeds benefiting the radio station you

wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on this show\nMe too and politics me too in Hollywood me too in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories we've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors their mentors people they should be able to trust\nThe reality is causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain he never sailed he he took advantage and dreams you\nThat's a big gold medalists alley raised ... she was speaking at the trial of Larry Nassar he was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was recently sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the ... trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater bride II feral she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager\nSo he helps drive my teenager and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciate it\nBy another skater when she was just a teenager\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to inform practice which both of our families really appreciated and so anti would almost pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to the rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and skate when\nThere was molestation that happened before and after I mean and the rink parking lots of high school parking lot\nRight he was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year old Olympic medalist ab Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became brought his mentor and helped her family\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I home from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThen I mean I can\nPicture clear as day back out of her driveway go down the street stop sign to take a right and you go to my house\nAnd it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um a few streets over and there was a dead end which in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took off ... turned to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had that moment I said nothing\nI just sat there and um\nI Will sit here and honestly say I did I say no I did not open the door and not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah I mean people say there's fight or flight but there's freaks and that's what happened and I remember\nAfter that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like pick a fog or a ... I mean now now we have an especially I was like W. A. T.\nS. [laughter] yeah you know and like shocked Robert Tonner present and only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just [noise] um and it wasn't violet in what we think of as traditional violence\nSo he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan and you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so\nYeah that I mean honest to God that is the day of my life changed he would keep doing this\nWe pretend to make these people will be so [noise] yeah that would be an honest to God that is the day my life changed\nHe would keep doing this in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so a lot of people say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to answer that awkward question on any and I never had sex and the\nTraditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was direct um [noise] and you're touching found on me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy is taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time\nI'm very much so so ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his\nDoctor for that and\nMy mom he came over to the house a couple of times and uh took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so how are you in your house yeah broke now wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to usually did not know how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean\nI think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have any anything to barter I didn't have\nMoney I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my ... flat body um and um I thought it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violence with me\nAnd she took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming on your blades are not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left\nBlades they're not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something there not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement curve is is pretty deep as a kid and so I'm\nAs you're getting better that all of those metrics have to change and for the Nineteen Ninety eight Olympic trials Saratoga winter club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we sent more people to the Olympic trials than the national training programs sent to the Olympic trials so our coach who also was volunteer had a fulltime\nJob and a family um he Andy took care of my blades and I mean our coach Andy and\nOther top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways my mother said if you want to go to a skating\nFind a ride to the rank and Andy what's my ride [noise]\nDo do you think he ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else that could be yeah um because he was kind to me in and gave me things um\nYou know bought me things about me gifts brought me out to dinner I mean some things that seems silly and trivial to someone like just stop for a second\nI I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns in the summer that's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute [laughter] it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids you're right but\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray [noise] two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away so and\nUm he said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I\nAnd he said that I could quote go he let me go why I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I can go to anything I had to come directly home and\nSo I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured that it fine but it was because he was controlling yeah yeah well I told my parents my only pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA role in my school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain of being in my bedroom\nHad twin beds in my bedroom and this yellow\nBedside table between the two of them in this phone was there and I remember being kind of under the covers and no one can hear me picking up the phone and dialing the phone number and being like Hi I'm home", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "27"}
