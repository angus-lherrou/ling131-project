Nineteen eighty three and his he's nine on released prints demos from way back then\nAnd so the thing about this is that like these aren't the like finished versions of these songs due to the demos a

you've seen the current justices back on the bench you go first\nI I mean we were in this a strange position again of a starting out as Supreme Court term with only eight justices and uh the thing was that within the court like\nAnd fighting Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now introduced a bill that's called stop basis act out you know that know how to fit [laughter] yeah\nAnd on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders in his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon and Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's\nYes they are is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into the season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they ... they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and it's this bumping 'em coverage of that I'm sure it can't hurt\nHelps them attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all

back you're listening to it's been a minute from NPR the show where we catch up on the week that was here with two gas this week Chris guiding her legal editor at buzzfeed news and I mean a sell your business correspondent for NPR a I have a question for you both\nBe honest do either of you remember your home coming from high school well\nOnly been to one because I was an exchange student so I remember ...\nRemember it extremely vividly but it was also confusing because I had never known that such an event exist it and it was very strange uh-huh Chris\nI think I went I was I wasn't a closeted gay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know it went like home coming in from but they were not at the notable or life moments that\nThey are for some others I'm bringing up homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise]\nThis is you know long distance as a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about\nThe news so this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names are Sicilia McBride and story during size I asked them about their home common story or the your average teenagers in the high school band Sicilia plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work both hiding in a corner on your man [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where did you go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for too you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond\nFond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner while\nWe actually played at at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah [laughter]\nThe Syrian story there a couple and their friends nominated them to be on the homecoming court\n... or at least one of the opportunity to win together or we didn't have to be together but I mean we didn't even have the chance for at least originally\nSicilia want it to run on the homecoming court as a king but at the school administration told her that only boys can be gains in only girls can be queens\nThe civilian and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender to titles in homecoming contest no ... no queens\nEveryone on homecoming court would just be known as quote royals but that didn't make the show in story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples story how to you\nSex couples story how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just your day and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting for equal regardless of their gender that for sure whether or not they were now that the king\nQueen or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to that school can say we're going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest one couple wants to run together\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae Beatty two plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that this court did what they should have done they don't like the new policy it isn't what home coming to post ... about\nUm outside Austin people that are hearing about it the common core ... they're not very positive what's been the worst kind of comments\nThat are mostly basically saying that were that were that were snowflakes rational special treatment and that that is exactly what they would have expected added\nElecting a same sex couple is that they were real and how what kind of everybody else\nPeople really think there's going to ruin homecoming movie and it up taking away the whole homecoming tradition\nGotcha is they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well is there going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next uh\nYes actually that's one of the teachers that has been talking to us throughout this whole issue mentioned break off hand man jumps youth but and I can't wait for which we get to Prague either they\nUsed to running for prom king and queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama ahead before the years done here please [laughter]\nThese two young women Sicilian stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support than others don't like the outcome the votes acts and you're done yet that's going to happen\nThat's going to happen next week but this story really made me think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country and so you have this school administrators and that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but\nEven they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think we're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older\nAnd I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and I mean we could have been having the same conversation Twenty years ago and somebody saying like\nThey're trying to be supportive why aren't they okay with just being known as friends why why why do we need to talk about the fact that they're a gay couple and\nSo much to my guest Chris guiding her who covers the Supreme Court for buzzfeed news\nNPR's Alina Selyukh a business correspondent for NPR I'm I Know how we're busy thank you for

down with your family at the Thanksgiving dinner table said grace or whatever you do and then immediately began to fight with your family of course you have things get heated\nBut also hilarious politics and stuff and then at some point maybe you like me said to yourself at that table well dang\nThis could be a movie I should have pitched that screenplay because now that storyline is a movie and it's coming out this month the movie is called the oh it is directed by and stars I Baron hopes he's an actor an improv comedian who you may have seen before\nI'd Baron health is best known for his role on the Mindy project he plays the weird and lovable nurse Morgan Tucker's uh I also started in HBO's east bound and down and back in the day he was on ... TV show which I loved\nSo this new movie the ... it is a political satirical thriller in which a very contentious Thanksgiving dinner with a politically divided family uh takes a really weird turn and suddenly becomes a life or death situation\nTiffany Haddish plays the wife of ice Baron hopes his character\nAnd he tells us all about what it's like to work with Tiffany Haddish onset I can I talked last week the morning after the oath premiered at the LA film festival I got to go to the premier it was a blast I talked with ICC at NPR West in Culver City California enjoy [noise]\nUm so\nI was there as a monster movie nice to see you and your element I met you argued out down just try and my wife I mean it was like\nWe got to be with us she did go to ... which I'm Russia like the ... like do you think [laughter]\nI'm like I'm On my regard a man listen uh people asked George Clooney if he's friends with Brad Pitt no it's just the way to go I just thought she was\nIt's just the way I Do I get ... she was a three that\nUm you were dressed up working the red carpet\nDo you like to kind of stuff's going to be that I'm not a big fancy dresser type of guy but it's part of the you know part of the deal and it is it is like fun than my parents come in town now you know they get hair and makeup done a lot of makeup done and uh\nWhen they were ... we go uh you know it's it's it's fun to go and you always see some fans are and stuff so it it is fun and exhilarating but it also it was fun to kind of come home at the end of the night and yet I could talk about it and stuff\nWas this one different because it was for some directing the movie definitely I'm always just kind of you know an actor for\nUsually so when you go it's you know you're proud of the movie you're not proud of the movie but it's just a small part of it and\nYou can either take as much credit or have kind of you know no accountability and you just kind of show up for the party and stuff but for this one because it is\nThis movie is so kind of you know personal to me it's something I'm working on for for almost a year or ... yeah this is this I'm going to give it all yeah yeah I could tell they were working I was working with him I was talking to everyone you got to got to do it now so let's describe this film for our listeners without\nSport let's just weather's so if you can imagine a politically charged America that is incredibly divided can imagine that uh but but there is that there's a there's a presidential administration that's that's obsessed with loyalty\nAnd they have a introduce state it's not compulsory but it's a highly suggested um loyalty oath [laughter]\nSo uh the deadline to sign it is the uh Friday after Thanksgiving Black Friday everyone's favorite holiday [laughter] yeah and so the whole movie takes place during that we can Thanksgiving and and uh my character Chris uh\nIs very liberal and very upset by what's going on and very into consumed by the twenty four hour news cycle\nAnd his wife is Tiffany Haddish [noise] ah the characters ... she's played by Tiffany Haddish I don't I wouldn't also kind of like middle aged half to go to prepare for girls trip exactly\nThat would be kinda cool yeah and she's kind of you know\nTrying to keep the family together and just trying to do her best to keep going forward and we have everyone come into the house mom dad brothers interpreted brother conservative brother a slightly left of center sister kind of the whole family is all over the map and\nThe first kind of half of the movie is really all about you know trying your best to not talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving in fire this and all it actually did a it was right the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election how hot one it was a ... people didn't know what to\nWhat to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten this argument [noise] there was a little bit of wine involved\nBut you know what struck me about the argument was that we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically Mm I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and\nI think his position was you know will burn it could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in in South central Ohio and she was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's Kobe's fault and this\nAnd it just struck me that if we're also aligned and ... and we're fighting what's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive\nYeah what I Love about the movie and you miss 'em that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election in my ... throughout was like people to talk about it more yeah because this stuff shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preach to the choir here to talk about it more but now I'm usually like everyone just shut up [laughter]\nI mean I was like you I was the guy for a good year and a half that\nSit down at dinner with some friends first day on TALK about can you believe that this is insane and I did it that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about is that what is bigger what's the bigger news story and you're in my lifetime that were happening now there's not one minute so I I I was getting frustrated at people's\nFrustration with me talking about it but I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just if you are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really has obsessive and he's consumed by the cycle\nSo I had to CNN Fox News MSNBC on twenty four really and I was reading it and it makes you crazy to do\nIt is a a slightly romantic story but I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the wear and tear that that she was going through with him um because that was very\nVery much based off of my wife I really yeah so well my wife who is it is you know politically active and she goes to the marches and has very little in the U.S to NPR [noise] um\nTo NPR [noise] um is Steven keep your liver she does not in the area [laughter]\nI'm a I'm a ... there was one morning where it was like six twenty five in
