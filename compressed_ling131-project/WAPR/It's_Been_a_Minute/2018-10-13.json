that the odds are that I'm Out to the audience I mean I Am right I mean 'cause I have been for like Thirty years but um but but\n[laughter] [noise] from NPR I'm Sam Sanders it in a minute today on the show we're taking a break from the news to focus on just one day from this past week in October eleven that was national\nComing out day this year is the thirtieth anniversary of that day and a thing I always think every year around this time is it never just one day coming out happens differently for every one of the more than once and for some of us it seems like the process never really in\nA case in point my friend Bob Mondello film critic for NPR's all things considered how old are you Bob I turned Seventy next year shut up no really so okay what year did you come out\nAh [noise] that's a hard question to answer do you mean to myself do you mean to my folks do you mean to my friends do you mean I I ... it depends what you're talking\nOkay well you see what I'm saying today on the show we're going to explore the history of coming out and coming out day I was how it came to be and how it's changed over time and what it means for the ... community to them\nBack when Bob grew up in the sixties you could get locked up for even going to a gay bar it was a very different times so Bob's first coming out actually wasn't until Nineteen Seventy four after he just had his first same sex experience Bob told his best friend who he thought might also be gay\nI was in his apartment\nAnd it took me forever to work up to it I I was sitting there and\nI was taking deep breath and I was trembling [noise] um but what I said was I'm gay\n[laughter] I acted him to say so am I in fall into my arms and what he actually said was\nTwice in one week\nWell that was\nGoing to react and how dare somebody else beat me to this [laughter] um but at an event you know when I was coming out we didn't have a models in public discourse there were no models for gay people owned a generous hadn't come out on television\nAnd uh the will and grace was far in the future and so um I think it's a different world than I I hear about people coming out at the age of twelve and I think could lord I was never that brave I mean never in the world\nAnd I don't really know what it would be like today to do that\nI don't know either I mean I remember my process and it literally Bob it took me years just to look at myself in the mirror and say the words I Am gay\nIt took me years to do that okay now if I can turn this interview on it said why\nI oh God well some of the reasons I was here so much younger than I Am way what I'm suggesting is you're ... you're coming out of the different period and it yeah so yeah I mean I was raised in a church where it was you went to hell for it uh yeah yeah like totally okay that is different\n[noise]\nYou kind of [noise]\nYelling when you're going to come [noise]\n\nComing out in Nineteen Ninety seven when James and then plus more with professor Marci

minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders\n[noise] this week we're talking about national coming out day ... this past Thursday October eleventh we're looking at some big moments in coming out history and hearing the coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of Nevada Las\nVegas you're talking to me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment\nYeah it was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll her a lot\nWith Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen Ninety seven on ABC sitcoms\n\n[noise]\n\nI remember this year I was like Thirteen and I remember\nI don't think my parents told me not to watch but I knew that I shouldn't watch wow that makes sense and I and I probably thought later knocked to see it but I remember how big of a deal it was for this woman to come out\nOn her prime time TV show to her therapist who was at that time played by Oprah [laughter] oh God I remember that old I remember\nRight exactly and it's not like a ...\nExactly and it's not like I'm looking for protection you know I just I just want somebody special somebody you know that I I click with\nAnd obviously you didn't click with Richard has there ever been any one use cells you clicked with them\nAnd what was his name is [noise]\nThey both for younger over [laughter]\nI don't know I as I thought if I just ignored it you know just go away and I can just live a normal life\nAnd what is a normal life Ellen no\nNormal I mean just the same thing everybody wants to my house and picket fence you know Don cat Sunday barbecues and a lot of someone who loves me when I can build a life with just I just want to be happy\nAnd you think you can't have these things with a woman well\nAs I had a pretty big problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nSo I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and one of the backlash that she face was pretty ethic lost the show all these conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads on the show ABC actually\nPut an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that I find it hard to imagine area and I'm so in April in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality all the good characters are upbeat\nYou know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that but not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids\nOr you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue or the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise was a terrible biggest wow\n[noise] it's so funny he says there's an agenda here to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah they mail is appalling [laughter] the whole he'd have kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear because of course with it\nOf course what they were terrified about that it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump to a ... and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know a prep for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh\nIs wind up here um and he sets off a brain blue flag waving firestorm really of protests when he says don't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nIn the ... gone from Ninety nine eleven Ellen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academic saying don't do it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay\nSo for one and this is debatable\nAmerica is is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out reinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm\nI'm paraphrasing ... you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it they don't wear as head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMake the heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people\nAnd that no particular sexuality should be the expected default\nSpeaking of the ways that things have just become more fluid I'm thinking of the ways that celebrities come out now you know ... ... an R. and B. singer Frank Ocean and she came out but he never use the word gay right you know do you think about Jodie Foster Amos Lee kind of came out\nThe globe's we actually have paper that\nYou know I'm just get it right out there right loud and proud right so I'm I'm any support on [noise]\n\nI think\nI already did like on the outer thousand years ago back in the stone age\nA young girl\nOpen up the trust of friends and family co workers and then gradually proudly to everyone who knew her everyone should actually\nBut now apparently I'm told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life with a press conference fragrance enterprise I\nHave a point Mike do should have a point should we be forced should anybody be forced to like do the coming out in the way that people say you're supposed to be coming out yeah and\nSee this is where we go back to it being both a personal and political choice\nAnd I think the personal have to come first and I think that you know you and I know the the list of celebrities who we all sort of wink wink you know amount\nAnd you really want to come out and who flirt with that much like first it did [noise] um and then for whatever reasons whether it's Tamil you'll um whether it's just they don't want to be pigeonholed you know\nThey decide not to or they don't yet or they wait or whatever and I think I think there's got to be room for that too I Do I care more about whether people get in the way of social change or eight and\nSomebody is down with the struggle if they are helping the movement however they want to do it whether it's overt or covert I think the choice of whether they command as up to them [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nAlabama coasting

sunshine expected Los tonight back down at the upper fifties for much of the state you're listening to it's been a minute for NPR\nI'm Sam Sanders this past Thursday October eleventh was a dirty national coming out\nWas it thirty national coming out day mark that day we are exploring coming out I Would never just one day and\nHow it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with e Patrick Johnson head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people and there's people whoever\nWhere you live a gay life but you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day where you tell everyone [laughter] folks know and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me to be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white\nAm I right than uh yeah yeah and yeah and if you are already hailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your right to a a a black person I like the next person Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nAny choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the\nConnection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find a game in a ... a whole ... of them yes um\nAnd it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my\n... out of work I mean I felt safe there like as a young black boy in the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm there was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there\nYeah I mean the church is where I was encouraged to um express myself which you know I was a big old clean love 'em and and the choirs than a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos\nAnd I'm sure that ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell and God gave you age because you sent ... ... not in my church that I thought okay\nThank God okay [laughter] but many charges were doing but many are absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it's a really a\nConcert [laughter] place yeah no but that's that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low a phenomena and also we should stop to define what the down low is for those who might not know\nYes so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay\nAnd they're usually black and only ... for men other than black man\nYes I'm even though that's not true\n[laughter] well I mean like we have these euphemisms for like white man they but they were living in a life you know yeah that lead a double life yeah what does it say about\nWhat coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies to coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time the subset of the community black men they're still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that\nYes there was a part of the community that we're not being opened there was another part that was actually being\nVery open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of a black in Latin next lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing of pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a Shereen arabica Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these black lesbians yeah and like lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out of being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision [laughter] but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who share to coming out story with us on a as twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago on it\nYears ago and he came out to family and friends as quit their parents reacted okay not great but okay but he has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes on my professor had brought in a kind of trends she was a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story is a guy I was like raise to be only strong and like no softness and\nUm and I've always felt like something was wrong but like compensated by being like in the military and I got a wife and kids and like all this stuff and on and I never gave myself face to really like ask myself and really like\nThink about who I Am\nI Would like to go back in my chair and I always did that are in class and I'm just kinda mulling over another like giving yourself the space to ask yourself [noise] I've never done that before\nInteresting and sort of put his myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I like the answer was no ...\n\nOn a recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nThey kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like me I have I and everybody is like things about their body but we still all like\nMake our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean dissociative with your with like a body part and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I\nKind of made it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something like that\nYeah the other day and we'd like that are good night than as going off to bed and my dad called out I after me and say like well again tonight and thanks for being yourself\nI mean maybe we'll\nNever really under stand\nUnder stand and that but\nI'm Still ... and um yeah I mean we don't know each other [noise]\n\nThat was on a ride in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Alan did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monet a is an example because she didn't come out as gay or it was something much more fluid\nAnd I think we're in a moment of trans ... and gender non conforming aid that is really influencing\nHow people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well I'm not heterosexual\n[laughter] yeah well and like she said that she opened me was I think pan sexual and it's just a guy from time to grow up time and people that are not going for me at times and also thinking the same vein of someone like Frank Ocean who kind of came out but in actuality never ever used the word gay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Selma", "day": "13"}
