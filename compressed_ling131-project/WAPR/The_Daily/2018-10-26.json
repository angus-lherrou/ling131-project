{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAPR", "content": "This was an election where President Obama was running for reelection and his opponent Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts\nWas you know trying to figure out a way to come up against an incumbent who was hugely popular among young voters among the minority voters you know what we've come to think of as the Obama coalition\nYour father was born in Mexico\nSo the question is are you a Mexican American could you be the first Hispanic president I I Would love to be able to convince people that particularly in the Florida primary [laughter]\nBut I think that might be disingenuous in my part because [noise]\nWith the Republican Party during twenty twelve was wrestling with was how to mobilize some of its messaging around social conservative issues around faith around you know small business regulations\nRomney youngest son crack spoke to a group of Hispanic small business owner\nOn some of these topics that Hispanic voters tend to have in common with conservative voters\nWho shares your values\nPresident Obama used his healthcare plan to declare war on religion at the same\nExact time the president has been feverishly focused on winning Latino voters in Spanish language ads about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor\nThe Democrats and President Obama's campaign they were reaching out to Latino voters in very targeted ways\nThe stories of Latino community are stories about the American dream young people who believe that anything is possible as parents and grandparents working hard to give their children the chance to succeed\nAnd then in August of twenty twelve effective immediately right before the election you have the introduction of DACA\nThe department of homeland security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people\nWhich really was a huge moment of elation for Hispanic voters and for which he knows broadly who cared about immigration reform\nSo how did these dueling strategies Obama's Ann Romney's\nVoters and for which he knows broadly who cared about immigration reform\nSo how did these dueling strategies Obama's Ann Romney's work out for each of the candidates when it came to the Latino vote\nWell I think to answer that question you really just have to look at the results President Obama won the Hispanic vote by something like Seventy one percent and Mitt Romney took just twenty seven percent one of the all time lows in presidential election history\nAnd what lesson do Republicans take from what looks to be an electoral blowout when it comes to Latino voters\nOr a little bit to mass focus and not focus in people's hearts that we don't relate to I think average Americans more than we should um stuffy old guys\nThey came out in twenty twelve with the now famous autopsy report which really instructed candidates to find ways to communicate with Hispanic voters and with other minority voters to bring them out to the polls to show them that the Republican Party is\nNot just open to them but supports policies that will help them\nThe report recommends the G O P spend ten million dollars toward new minority outreach efforts and even more ON Technology and building it improved voter database\nImportant piece of contacts that we need to remember is that President George W. Bush\nWas actually fairly popular among Hispanics he pulled in forty percent of the Hispanic vote ... thousand for just a few elections before that is a huge swing and what it signaled to strategists and twenty twelve was if only they could get the messaging right\nIf only they could show Hispanics that Republican conservative policies were going to help improve their lives than you know in the future they could wear away at the sort of democratic Obama coalition that had cost them two presidential elections already\nSo once Republicans see that there are potential inroads what do they actually do to try to win Latino voters back\nSo after the twenty twelve election after this autopsy report boom\nBoom you have you know Jeb Bush George W Bush's brother of course running for office showcasing his bicultural family\nI'm married to a Mexican American in the United states citizen I'm immersed in the culture I'm bilingual I feel like I'm\nThe whole family I'm married to a Mexican American United States citizen I'm immersed in the culture I'm bilingual I feel like I'm bicultural I'm proud of of the diversity of my own family\nSpeaking Spanish and a lot of campaign stops\nLawyer in these bottles me will George Bush didn't give\nMorning I don't know you have Marco Rubio running on the strength of his support in Florida and on the fact that he had you know tried to cooperate on a comprehensive immigration reform bill\nAnd when we talked about illegal immigration is not about demanding right it's about appealing to the passion of the nation\nIn the history of the world you have even Ted Cruz senator of Texas at times attempting to speak Spanish at debate\nAnd I I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because they don't speak Spanish and second of all\nDay and if they get it [noise]\nAnd so you really start to see that the Republicans are taking seriously the idea that they need to reach out to Hispanic voters really trying to meet them where they are\nRight and what could be a greater testament to this kind of cultural changes in the party and the fact that two of those candidates you just mentioned crews and Rubio are themselves Latino it goes beyond political\nPandering it's true representation ... to have Jeb Bush's bicultural family prominently featured on the news to have him bragging about his ability to speak Spanish fluently that sounds really positive signals of inclusive\nAt the end of support to Hispanic voters and I really think that that can't be overstated and then came Donald Trump\nWhen Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have lots of problems that they're bringing those problems with us or\nWe see is Trump is um and in particular Trump's\nControversial immigration related rhetoric slowly creep into the mainstream of the Republican Party during the campaign during that campaign button in twenty Fifteen when he first announced his candidacy I think that Republicans were aghast at\nHis remarks and\nIn twenty Fifteen when he first announced his candidacy I think that Republicans were aghast at\nHis remarks and we're trying to figure out how to marginalize him but did not imagine that he would become the nominee for their party and eventually the president you\nKnow I think I'm going to do very well either legally I didn't see the wires that are doing well with Hispanics because I'm going to bring back jobs and they're going to get jobs right now they're going to get jobs I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics\nSo obviously we know how the election turned out in twenty sixteen how exactly did the Latino vote shake out in that election\nWell this is where there was a bit of a shock\nExit polls at the time showed that around thirty percent of Hispanic voters actually supported President Trump during the twenty sixteen election he actually did a little bit better than Mitt Romney dead at the ballot box better than running better than Romney that feels\nGenuinely unexpected [noise]\nYou know when I saw the exit polls yeah my first instinct was surprised I thought that he would get a lot fewer voters than Romney did in twenty twelve mhm but then when I started looking at the numbers as they became available my realization was that it wasn't\nSo surprising that Republican leaning Latino showed up at the same rate that they did in previous\nCampaigns what was surprising to me is that a record number of Latino didn't vote fourteen point three million Hispanic voters did not cast ballots in twenty sixteen\nDespite a race that seemed like it would very much animate Latino voters theoretically against Donald Trump\nAnd what that indicated to me and what I think it's been born out in conversations I've had across the country since then\nIs that Trump alone was not enough to motivate a lot of voters immigration policy alone was not enough to motivate some of these voters mhm what I concluded and I think what a lot of other people are starting to see is it the Latino vote is just much more complicated\nMuch more nuance than we understood before and they care about a lot more issues than they are being spoken to about\n\nWe'll be right back the daily is supported by ... online test prep for the A.
