{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAPR", "content": "From nominees started campaigning when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best right into his presidency we're going to build the wall we have no choice we have no [noise]\nI Know here it is again the Trump Administration officials are considering legally defining gender is somebody's biological sex at birth\nI Know that could jeopardize the rights of more than ... million transgender Americans\nMidterm seeds in a different Republican Congress has again trying to stay in power and why do I see just days away from voting\nTo have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now you know that as long as I Do and we're looking at a very serious\n\n[noise]\n\nOh hello hello congressman whether Hi how're you doing so I decided to call in whether well\nLet me let me let me tell you honestly I thought we were going to make great gains in the Nineteen Ninety four election\nBut I remember being with with Newt oh maybe a week before the election or two weeks before the election and he predicted with absolute certainty that we were going to take control of the oh\nOh how well did you get to know and in what context\nOh Newt and I were very very close and in fact I was considered his closest political confidant in the house during the Nineteen eighties you know argued about something and we agreed on a lot of things but we believe that there was a Republican majority out there and that we needed to pursue different strategies\nTo turn it into a majority in the house of representatives so remember we'd had twelve years a Republican president right eight years Ronald Reagan in four years of George W. Bush\nAnd we elected President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety two minute understood that in the mid term election with a Democrat in the White House there was a great opportunity for Republicans to win congressional seats and we're\nHere because we are taking the first step\nOver things issues that the Republicans could run on\nAnd we're taking a contract with the American people\nA new devised a contract with America which I worked with him on quite a bit\nPublic ... could run on and we're taking them in a contract with the American people\nAnd new devised a contract with America which I worked with him on quite a bit to help give people something to talk about\nEvery item in our contract you supported by sixty percent or more of the American people this is a contract with Americans for America\nTook a main dynamic was sitting President Clinton had done a number of things that aggravated the conservative base\nTonight I Want to report to you on the progress we've made\nA made turned out to vote and knew that that was going to give us seats that we had never been able to win before\nDo you remember specifically what things Clinton was doing that was riling up today we ask the well off to pay their fair share\nUm first of all raised taxes and that was a bad thing\nIf you send the legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away you will force me to take this pen veto the legislation and we'll come right back here and start all over again\nThen of course the failed attempt to pass Clinton care which was probably the biggest negative issue and then there were some social issues\nI Believe that American citizens who wants to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies him from doing so\nGays in the military and things like I think that we today couldn't imagine we're really controversial living but back then they were\nRight and then after doing a town I remember gay marriage being pretty prominent issue\nThis is not prejudice legislation the defense of Marriage Act is not mean spirited or exclusionary it is a preemptive measures to make sure that a handful of judges and a single state cannot impose an agenda up on the entire nation\nAnd another one that I remember one so called partial birth abortion yeah and I'm curious how much thought went into focusing on that specific issues because they certainly didn't seem arbitrary\nYeah well you're not wrong first of all the central social issue really was and in my judgment is abortion\nMhm in the immediate aftermath of roe versus Wade the right to life movement United around the notion of amending the constitution to ban abortion over time\nPeople figured out a couple of things first of all that there was not going to be political support for amending the constitution and second of all of their wasn't political support for banning abortion but ... still was quite United around trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be of Bill Clinton you know\nBut right to life much still was quite United around trying to minimize abortion\nVision should be of\nBill Clinton you know ran for office saying where abortion is safe abortion should be safe legal and legal but rare and rare\nBook\nHe felt the need to use the word rare because he understood people were an easy about abortion even though they did not want to ban so binding away to try to restrict some abortions without banning abortion across the board resulted in\nThe focus on late term abortions which most people oppose that most people thought by the way were illegal\nThe term partial birth abortion means the person performing abortions partially that generally delivers a living feeders before killing the fetus and completing the delivery\nName partial birth abortion did not exist until someone who want to Japan and abortion procedure made up this erroneous and inflammatory term\nWhen it came to these particular late term abortions\nWhat seemed to me either very clever\nOr definitely cynical depending on your point of view was that it supports Democrats to take the lead a position on abortion and its most extreme which then painted them into a corner\nYeah I think that you're basically right about although I wouldn't that's not the words that I Do is you know we we have the term Reagan Democrats back in the Nineteen eighties and the Reagan Democrats essentially were southerners that used to be Democrats and blue collar northerners mainly Catholics that used to be Democrats crossed over and they voted for\nReagan well in both cases there were Democrats that were at odds with the liberal consensus\nOn these social and cultural issues we've been talking about so you take a democratic politician and you put them in a very difficult position if you force them to come front and center on some of those issues because it created a wedge between their liberal base if you want to use that term\nThe more traditional conservative cultural voters so to force Democrats to confront those issues you know was a winner for the Republicans no question about it\nYou know it's funny one of those early memories I have back then was seen Patty Murray is very liberal Democrat from Washington state\nEarly memories I have from back then was seen Patty Murray and very liberal Democrat from Washington state who is you know I'm trying to remember her she was a senator who was voted in during the year of the women\nAnd I think she was the avatar of progressive promise and suddenly the Senate was voting on the defense of Marriage Act\nAnd she like the majority of Democrats was voting to ban gay marriage and I remember her coming off the Senate floor and being surrounded by a scrum of local reporters\nAnd she looked pretty miserable defending her position\nYeah the ... well the Democrats were definitely tortured over those issues and a lot of them change their position to conform with\nA more liberal cultural view and that accelerated the movement of cultural conservatives into the Republican Party there\nWere no longer Ronald Reagan Democrats or ... Democrats [noise] they were Republican\nSo how do you think the strategy has aged\nWell that's a good question I I think that yeah I I think that there are some issues where it's\nContinued to work but I think that there are some problems\nThat the Republicans face long term because of the changes in the culture the most obvious I think and it's a place where I think Republicans are changing as on on the LDP T. Q. issues but\nI think that those issues I I don't know I'd like to say that they have aged well or poorly I I Would simply like to say that\nThey present a challenge to Republicans going forward even up in the short term they are working it would seem to the benefit of President Trump and Republican\nSo you were anticipating where my mind was moving which is that certainly his latest two thousand for gay marriage seemed to be working in the Republicans' favor but as you're pointing out millennial Republicans now more of them have a gay marriage not\nAnd many older Republicans are keeping mum about this issue I keep thinking about how John Kades it during the debates you know gave this response when asked about gay marriage where he just basically said that his God told them to let everyone\nI I think I think that the gay issue is a little different than some of the other\nSaid that his God told them to let everyone\nKnow I I think I think that the gay issue is\nA little different than some of the other cultural issues\nOne of the things that's happened is that everybody today\nKnows gay people that\nWas not always the case as\nPeople kept it hidden and an awful lot of the Republicans you're talking about are confronting a different reality which is this is no longer a logical issue or theoretical issue this is about my friend jak gr my friend Linda or the people that I Know\nLooking back on it do you think that they were on the wrong side of history", "show_name": "The Daily", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "25"}
