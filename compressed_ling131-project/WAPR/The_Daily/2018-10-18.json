room of what you're going to have how much of it is pre programmed how much of it may be another surprise us work\nWell you you know you make reservation you you come sit down and see for the most part the lineup that's posted on the Internet and then quite often they're a drop ins of famous people certainly can't count on it mhm but it happens regularly through the week\nAnd just tell me exactly what a what a drop in it when somebody like a Chris Rock or Chappelle or somebody will be in town\nAnd you know comedians they need\nAn audience to work out their material it's not like any other like a musician can sit home and record and practice or almost any other art form you can find a way to do it yourself but stand up comedy only exist in front of an audience right so that kind of live interaction well you're you're a joke only works if people less mhm so the audience here comes\nThinking maybe I Want to hear this comedian that comedian two or three and all of a sudden Chris Rock Jerry Seinfeld whoever drops in tests out their material transforms the night yeah [noise] so tell me if you what about the night of August twenty six just a few weeks ago where were you that I I remember\nI was actually in bed I didn't I didn't find out about it till the next morning tell me about it what what what exactly happened\nHe came down he performed really yeah and when I woke up in the morning I saw a text message St Louis here after the fact yeah and what did you find out what happened\nWas that he had a notebook he did a set apparently it was the notebook that he had been using the last week that he done comedy prior to this and he just I think decided I'm just going to\nPick up where I left off and do you know how he was introduced kind of how the roughly what words were used in how the audience reacting what's your regular ... to ... the the host or something like you know uh\nI'm actually really excited there's no need for an introduction you know this guy as we've grown up for the K everybody [noise]\nI'm actually really excited there's no need for an introduction you know this guy as we've grown up from the K everybody [noise]\nLadies German you know the guy from his show on\nPlease make welcome Louis seeking something like that you know there was no\n\nAnd do you know how the audience responded and that you [noise]\n\nDo you know any of the examples of a joke he tried out during his performance yet that parades about tipping waitresses it was just that we're not very startled and ... says in a way that\nThis was reconstructed in the media and correct me if any what's wrong he he does a familiar routine he does a step that is classic decay he mentions whistles and one of the things he mentions it's a joke about a rape whistle so it sounds like classic Louis the gay despite the fact that those kinds of jokes have a different entirely different residents\nWe I don't think he was tuned in to that the joke was about his daughter said someone that you know that not all whistle for clean what about the expression clean as a whistle and so we started talking about different with all this kind of with all that was All right with all that don't they'll clean and that led wasn't a rape joke by any means\nMhm it sounds like it was a performance that did not address what I Would regard as the elephant in the room they didn't address it\n\nIsn't nice line\nAnd I know Joe\nComedian Louis decay surprise that parents had a comedy club just months after admitting to allegations of sexual misconduct\nThere was no threat to women [laughter]\nUniting a firestorm not have the right to make that anymore and they ... up the me too movement why some say it's too soon [noise]\nWhen did you realize that this was going to be a a big deal like a lot of hate mail I got threats of violence really I mean what was the content of those kinds of sports when they were firebombed the club things like that scary\nCan I ask you know as this criticism is coming in\nYou identifying what you like meaningful criticisms and push back yeah and and limited in what are they yes so some of the people felt ambushed mhm you know you can imagine you wait all week to go out to a comedy club on Saturday Night and ...\nAnd you walk into something which really really upsets you when you're angry at the place for doing that so what I've done\nIt's a comedy club on Saturday Night and ... and you walk into something which really really upsets you and you're angry at the place for doing that so what I've done to answer that is that we have a very clear policy essentially said swim at your own risk we\nDon't know who's going to pop in ... if somebody pops and not to your liking you can leave no questions asked you your check is on the house we don't want him such as\nSo nobody can say there were a captive audience which would infuriate me to other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he was a comedian\nAnd like okay when do you think he could come work yeah he's like\nNever mhm might never he says never\nI said well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton who was credibly obviously accused in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere\n... nobody\nLike why were they cheering Roman Polanski as they were for years why were they giving standing ovations ... director accused of sexually abusing the ... he did it\nBut behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Luis became a comedian is someone who gives them a stage and in this case that's you rub I'm had nobody\nCares that Mike Tyson who raped or convicted of raping somebody performs and looking only controlled the venue you control yes but but it it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistency in the world and when you see wildly inconsistent demands if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of women and exposes open and women should never work again\nBut it sounds like you're saying why should I Know I'm the owner of comedy cellar do something out of the normal way of warning an audience\nNot why should I be from now when I'm warning you know and I said that but even though I Will do that do not expect people to the warning people outside of Bill Clinton's and that's what I'm saying I don't want my customers upset but the overlay this entire moral structure on it\nAnd they present it as if don't you understand how the world works and I I look around\nBut the overlay this entire moral structure on it\nAnd they presented as if don't you understand how the world works and I I look around at the was the last you know that's not the way\nThe world working world very much fixing chooses so I have two ways to handle it I can either get involved in that and on this person can perform this person you can reform and explain to them well how come you let norm go on and you you know I'm gonna become a hypocrite overnight mhm or\nI told the audience this and this is the comedy cellar it's unfiltered and\nWe don't want you here not understanding that it's not the end of the world to see somebody that you don't like or that you ... you know but if it is in the world for some people it may be based on their their traumas in their own life are the things they know it's just too difficult\nSo then this is not the place for them to come or you can come and just leave [laughter] no questions asked drinks on the house
