{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAPR", "content": "And what's happening with the FBI investigation as these four interviews are being conducted what happens\nIs that as the FBI is sending their agents out to talk to these poor people\nThis list of witnesses is only the beginning it's not the end of what the FBI needs to do and anything short of a full fair investigation will be a sham\nThe White House comes under intense pressure to make it clear that this isn't such a constrained investigation that it would be essentially a sham\nThey cannot say oh hey only interview the people in their neighborhood on one side of the street or only interviewed people from a certain period of their life you let the men and women and the FBI the professionals do their jobs\nAnd for people to some especially Democrats it's starting to feel like show right\nThat pressure gets to be enough that the White House finally says that the president himself says the FBI can investigate this however they see\nFit the FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason\nAnd they essentially give the green light to the FBI to go beyond just those poor people\n\nI mean like in the times since the investigation began the public's focus and to some degree the Senate's focus has turned to cabinets\nTo Kavanaugh's credibility and his honesty during that hearing and the question of did he misrepresented passed in a way that shouldn't be concerning for potential Supreme Court justice do we know if the FBI investigation has focused at all\nOn investigating his truth is our colleagues kid Kelly and Robin Pogrebin\nTold us that a lot of Kavanaugh's classmates\nHave come forward and tried to reach the [noise]\nTo describe this behavior that they see as at odds with that [noise]\nWe drank beer and\n\nYou know so so did I think the vast majority of of people our age at the time but in any of that one drink beer and and a soldier so whatever you know\nEspecially when it comes to this drinking and some of them said they weren't quite sure how to reach the FBI and we're having trouble actually getting a hold of people at the FBI so it seems like knowing whether the FBI has connected with them and bother to talk to them\nWould be telling in knowing just how much the FBI is incorporating this question of truthfulness in his assassination\nRight and I think we may not know until the reopen background check is officially completed and we see what the scope is that they've done as of now there is definitely evidence that suggests that a lot of the people who are wanting to come forward are struggling to feel like they're being heard\nSome of them are being told to simply file reports an online Web portal which teams\nOne person described to me is sticking a needle back in the haystack that that whenever they're going to say isn't actually going to get to the right people in other cases there have been names that have been given directly to FBI agents directly involved in this inquiry and yet the people whose names have been given have not yet been\nCalled by the FBI and so we don't know for sure whether there was a directive by the FBI to specifically focused on his honesty and whether or not he misled or lied or miss characterized\nHimself during that testimony however keep in mind all of this is intertwined all of this is related\nQuestions about his drinking could potentially affect how you decide whether or not he was truthful and denying the sexual misconduct right if a senator conclude hey he wasn't truthful about his drinking so therefore I don't believe his ...\nHis denials on the sexual misconduct\nYou could also see a situation in which a senator might say look I Believe his denial about the sexual misconduct I don't think he\nTempted to rape a woman I don't think he exposed himself in a dorm room but I also think that when he sat before us for several hours in the Senate Judiciary committee and downplayed his drinking and now I've looked at all these interviews and and I see the testimony of people saying the opposite and I don't believe him\nAnd just the fact that I Believe he misled the Senate committee could be enough for this particular senator or that particular senator to say I don't think he should be on the court because regardless of whether I think he committed sexual misconduct you want somebody on the court who's honest and I don't believe he spent ... that's that's the kind of thought process that a senator could go through\nSo this is not about getting a definitive answer about whether judge Kavanaugh assaulted talked about the Ford or Deborah on your\nRight it's about giving more information for the senators who will be making that determining the FBI is not going to include what the FBI is going to do is summaries of the interviews in a form\nThat is known at the FBI is the three oh to that interview form of all of these people will be ultimately delivered to the senators who will then be able to read them\nAnd use the information as more grist in what they are going to ultimately have to do which is either vote yes or no on his nomination to the Supreme Court\nSo senators will have access to these FBI in ... three oh two forms will we have the public ever get to see them well\nThat's a good question and we don't know the answer to that normally the answer is no the FBI three oh two forms are not something that normally becomes public Senator McConnell the leader of the Republicans have said he doesn't expect them to become public\nAh we'll get an F ...\nIt'll be made available to each senator and all the senators\nWill be allowed to look at it that's the way these reports are always handle\nIt however this is a remarkable moment and a unique moment and there are senators on both sides who have said\nI Hope that they will make the report public Judiciary Committee member of Corning spoke of making the findings public\nGoing to be satisfied until some public statement about what the FBI so from a background of this\nSo from that rented us show you\nThey can't imagine that it wouldn't become public to the public has a sense of what the FBI fined for talking to people\nLike thank you very much sure happy to be on the show\nEarlier today with the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh completed\nThe Judiciary Committee allowed senators to review a single copy of its report Republicans and Democrats were given alternating hour long time to examine the document\nDemocratic senators called the report incomplete and insufficient\nIt looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps why the White House I don't know\n... Republican senators said the report offered no corroborating evidence to any allegations made against\nThat senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check out what their request it and I am ready to those we'll be right back\nThe daily it's supported by home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to a major role models homeowners can read reviews of local pros ad book appointments online at home at ... dot\nCom innovative immersive and skillfully investigated the daily with Michael Barbaro brings listeners today stories as only the New York times can report them for more on today's episode go to NY Times dot com slash the daily\nThanks to stay tuned to the daily here on listener supported Alabama public radio a service to the University of Alabama I'm Pat Duggins in tonight for stand in gold he's on assignment in Montgomery\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nImmobile symphony opening it season with rowing festivals October sixth and seventh at the singer theater this musical journey to the eternal city features works by re sneaky nearly as and Strauss tickets and information at mobiles Anthony dot org\nCommuting can be addressed but when people turn on NPR's daily news program MORNING EDITION some are grateful to be sitting in the car some people stay even after they arrive at their destination before you know you'll be wrapped up in the driveway of freeway moment\nTo have the traffic and turned into show to get you through the rest of the day MORNING EDITION from\nFrom NPR News [noise]\nMORNING EDITION weekdays beginning at five AM right here on a PR\nThe daily it's supported by I come I when you shop bank or play games on line that talk of mine for Twenty years after my has been dedicated to helping the wealthy top brand deliver fast reliable and secure digital experience to their customers on all devices I come I ha A.
