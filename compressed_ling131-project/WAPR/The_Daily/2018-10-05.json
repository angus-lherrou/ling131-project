{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAPR", "content": "That route Michael if I knew the answer to that I get a pay raise\nYou know it's so secretive that no one would tell us but I did find out the documents were forty six pages of interviews mhm and the FBI tried to reach hadn't witnesses they got nine nine of those forty six pages\nOr devoted to mark judge but as to what it actually looks like we don't know and they were so cautious that you know they wouldn't even described that kind of ACT UP how did they all look at this you know single documents\n\nSo there's a big buzz when they walk out and reporters are have bring them with\nQuestions and some of them are trying to escape they don't want to say anything we're running after them in the hallway saying you know what can you tell us about this report what's your take on this or did they interview and you know kind of elaborate though\nReally nobody is saying anything\nSo what do they\nDo they tell you well basically what we're\nGetting is that\nThe Republicans come out and their line and\nNothing in these documents\nShows any form of cooperation of the allegations against such Kavanaugh\nSharing your reaction to the other senators\nCome out Tim Scott of South Carolina he says oh I feel even more comfortable than I felt for senator\nSteve Danes of Montana's says well there is no cooperation at the time to vote that senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check out what they requested and sort of on and I am ready to vote and on and on\nThe fact that these allegations have not\nBeen collaborating Mitch McConnell the majority leader goes to the Senate floor and he declares that\nSherman Grassley started this morning new the new Judiciary Committee called the FBI located in a third party is going to trash to any of these allegations\nIt's time for the quotes hardest history on us to stop at times to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nAnd so Republicans are also kind of taking this one step further\nBut while we were doing everything we could to treat Dr Ford with the dignity and respect that she deserves our democratic colleagues did her a huge disservice\nThey're saying that they're the ones who did a better job protecting women that they didn't leak her allegations like the Democrats did\nWe know Dr Ford requested confidentiality but\nOur democratic colleagues deprived or about against her will\nThat they offered to fly to California to interview her in a setting that would have been comfortable for her and would have maintained her privacy so you know they're actually accusing Democrats of running a ... one of them I think Chuck Grassley called it a demolition derby\nAnd we're just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo for the Republican Cheryl the message is that the FBI report confirms what they already think that without definitive proof that an assault ever occurred\nKavanaugh should be considered innocent and because there's no definitive proof this has all been a calculated attempt by Democrats to hold up this nomination and smear Brett Kavanaugh has time for all that\nAnd uh has time for all that to end and for this guy to get confirmed right\nAnd what about the Democrats how are they spending that FDR report on there\nI Am not allowed to tell I can tell you I'm very differently\nBelieve that the message was designed to get to the truth for back\nSo the Democrats are saying this is an incomplete investigation that it was never intended to find the truth\nThere only ten people recession started that the people out there that they could have questions sat\nThere were many more witnesses out there that the FBI could have interviewed\nMany fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts\nThose fears have been realized so\nDemocrats are saying you know no wonder there was no corroborating evidence the FBI didn't look\nFor it [noise] so the Democrats aren't really disputing that this report doesn't offer any new information they're not saying that this report corroborate\nThose allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh it sounds like what they're saying is that because this report was always so limited in its scope because of the small number of people who were interviewed and the large number of people who were never interviewed\nThat it can't possibly prove anything for anyone that this report was kind of a waste of time\nWell right and not only that it can't possibly prove anything for anyone but that it was never intended to prove anything for anyone\nCandidly what we review today in a very limited time if it looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited or perhaps why the White House I don't know Dianne\nFeinstein when as far as to say that the White House seemed to be blocking what the FBI could do\nAnd ensure that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the Senate or the public in the hearings\nAnd as I talked to these senators today the Democrats I was struck by how many of them were bringing up kind of old arguments that they used at the very outset of judge Kavanaugh's nomination that they like what what like they were concerned\nWe're concerned that the leaders of the four members reproductive choice would overturn roe v way that he is a very very\nExpansive views protection for the president\nHas a very expansive view of executive power that would enable President Trump to put a stop to investigations into his own conduct [noise]\nRandom says Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader today and we were on an escalator down into the basement then I set them knowing that this is your plan what can you do\nTo stop this nomination from going forward\nAnd he just kind of shrugged and said\nAnything we can [noise]\nBut it was really clear to me that frankly there's not that much\nAnything you can [noise]\nI think the Democrats are
