an associate justice of the Supreme Court like having a confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill\nIt ... it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks informally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages stir mansion [noise]\nCircles has been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault before the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road\nThat led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nA vote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this worry dark chapter in the Senate ...\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different

assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma the second to a man promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are as it will bring shame and this is funny and um [noise]\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford sincere testimony\nI Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked off a lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bills\nBut while they differ on the root cause what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAs the legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than this\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward\nAnd you want to vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post\nThe whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle there's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and\nAlong and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work\nLet me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're at Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on\nSex covers gay and lesbian employees just as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote a when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so and that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for it\nIt's for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thinking you know so very much thank you my\nName's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to fate you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used with assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges you faced because of that

for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month's away and President Trump has this a victory

day the big question now is which party is voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News\nFor NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday\nAnd asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes it can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing votes\nCourt swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like I'm closely contested cases you will see a\nCourt that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thinking you know so very much thank you my\nName's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to fate you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nDoing them in the
