last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country\nBut this year the GOP is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nHave a really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting says how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month with the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I said some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes\nYes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New

immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish

is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says got Aaron Senate the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills about\nOne in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right

you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you've seen a lotta storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction caused\nBy thing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland in Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... out of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against on to sentence a former congressman um who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean\nWhat it could mean and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a steam leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four\nThere is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee\nThe mayor but it was pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as a Mexico beach right in the ...\nThe county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last and coincidentally just before\nThe hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually chain sewing trees away [laughter]\nAnd I'm moving debris really so he's changed on trees [laughter] well he's he's making sure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle is can be almost impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating scent of the people\nThat political as more computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you tomorrow on MORNING edition after a big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power\nPower but will that change after November tune in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you can ask 'em you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station by name\nShears the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood say all\nRight I can like you know [noise] [laughter]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns years and I should say Kmart needs to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or faced bankruptcy Jay Hancock is a Sears fan and historian and he joins us now thanks for being on the program\nAnd Mike who spent months sometimes use in the working under brutal condition\nSlavery at sea for the next ... reveal\n\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors Ali ... lifelong learning Institute at the University of Alabama it's for all who value learning travel and making new friends more at Ali dot U.

Navarro\nThe terms of less than a month away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lila so Ken Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nHaven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting is it how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want to kind of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen a good sign\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI said some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he is a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yet so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa's it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the Midwest and in the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administration in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nAdmit that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in
