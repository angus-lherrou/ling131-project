Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand states\nAnd little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five\nU.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that thing something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave ah what do you think state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nConnecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in\nCredit lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about uh how a democratic tax increases\nHave changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday

how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator

upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but I think that we come over\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over you decide that the data we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world weathering her man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political contacts um [noise]\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should uh be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best few another grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly gasoline\nI I think you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are\nAssociated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern and identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and innocent\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a real noticed concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a photo sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ... I think that every concession is no coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere by the question is whether you can do that with our board Hugo Rodney weaponized identity\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity as she makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lights that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chefs NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef as she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the night when she was so good to meet you were a little excited St\nLucie likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself the cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a [noise]\nHe has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes and ... and she takes up basal Lucy decides to taste it\nSo ... what does he play\nDiesel [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nSo this is one table\nToo that's at that says T.

News I'm due to the end of our good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years\nAnd the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul dozens are dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer glass\nA bomber in the capital Kabul dozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer glass she is in Kabul thanks for being with us good to be here live so were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence\nKeep them away you know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack with a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside a bit of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of cobble abroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred\nWhat will just mean they are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nBut I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament\nHas been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin does in Israel today as part of a

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in as temple ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many that issuing statements supporting a boat or Saudi Arabia and that I think so and of course that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worry that got people who are activists journalists gifted in\n'em and go maybe speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those that leverage with civil society\nOpinion a main fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region well\nThey've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated Dutch\nUh they need they need hard currency need foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the ins or to one was very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was best known among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank\nMuch thank

teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were very deeply blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these used official start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official they're showing you sound like it's not it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not just where not these about why the west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean so yeah it was before that that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were threats birth dates\nThey state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that to both is where they were transport dating insight to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more versus mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you both us and when their students were trying to escape on board will be ... by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to process it from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students so the federal police\nOpened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in spy boss is that not a good was just too\nAnd so these two versus\nWhat exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police start to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so\nWhen I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the ... for the army and for the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance
