with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years ... thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the shouting statement\nWhat does it tell you about how the kingdom is handling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is dead the account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm his death earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal Turkish authorities have been continuing this investigation and

to thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council\nSecondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president\nLeadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in in\nThe rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that\nDo not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen top two weeks is unacceptable uber gold or thank you thank you\nSo during the for

forces has doubled\nKill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm that your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is very important political party in Yemen to this llamas party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group and unless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you suggest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically yet is it a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\n[noise] I guess I'm among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli

the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are not ... a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't

appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of Madeline Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for Maddie\nBut she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and try to oxycontin at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal in lynching mere died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nThanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musical than she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect to real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry out for them and our hope also now lives with\nFor who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for a highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll

show through what we've done here is that\nIf you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people\nCan do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some

sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society\nWell yes the exports of a democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of a value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen coffee weeks is unacceptable\nFind ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt

obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old introductory continental highschool party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody up or some\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the ... we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and\nStick to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but when she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect to real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get them help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this and you're aerobics or\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to extend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that help for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pornography\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame are huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for medical center there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs who's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\n... rich on there [noise] I Can't make you love me\nIndeed I don't know\nKato knew about her sister Maddy lynching mayor in Vermont were ... thank you so much for being thank you so much for
