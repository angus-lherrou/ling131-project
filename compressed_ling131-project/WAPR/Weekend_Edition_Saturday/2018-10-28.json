the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking most impossible standard than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in rural\nAmerica for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jail and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because the boxing from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county [noise]\nIn twenty fourteen the town of Oso, Washington experienced one of the deadliest landslides in American history\nForty three people died Sherri ... is the sheriff's

objective which is like fifty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic county leaders took the idea\nAnd ran with it now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representatives from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of FEMA's emergency response flavor six term is completed\nThey talked through PowerPoint slides\nI think family five kind of the number it's referred items on there\nTo do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces\nLike distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nThis to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades ... also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she sent an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like you didn't an elephant you can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people\nIn Marysville, Washington rain drift through cedar forest next to a strip mall\nOfficer might you will cracks jokes with similar legal campers [laughter]\nI agree with all\nThe woods throughout this

and was about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly the [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well let me know eleven\nPeople were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a it as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us\nAnd again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nPut this into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRight I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise] um and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do it and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise] yeah well you mentioned\nThere will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um this is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen ... so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so that's just one small thing that community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and the people are trying to make sense of it yeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n[noise]\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\n[noise] well it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside that's in a God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter\nGuy I'm Christy we host of life from here\nYou know they see this country has more divided than ever but there's one thing we can all agree on the people just a little bit middlemen out you'll join us for a glorious evening of music and comedy that just might bring us a little closer together students\nSaturday for a live broadcast from a Fitzgerald Theater and St Paul Minnesota with again foresaw the warring treaty Mr Gabriel ...\nLive from here Saturdays and Sundays in right here on NPR\nFace his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated\nAnti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this has he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do on so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened well I\nThink it needs to to Asian than and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nI'm In this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti

been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who it's in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida at the morning\nIt's MORNING with it All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect to say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces and then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how to one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN his reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet or any other help are we getting a picture\nCNN has reported citing a source that a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding and nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that town [noise]\n[noise] yeah Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at a new river pizza\nWill say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about the last Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you living\nThese last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics weed and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me so we often\nTo explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me so we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default\nSo I have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of that statement and that silent whites me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be\nBut we're also decide accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people [noise]\nI think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact\nWhat the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively\nThat culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why ... is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this is also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair\nAnd our website where you can listen online or check out some latest local news that's available at H.

of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault one big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct

certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing it\nMuslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election now we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign but now here we're at that precipice again and it's\nA similar lines between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for
