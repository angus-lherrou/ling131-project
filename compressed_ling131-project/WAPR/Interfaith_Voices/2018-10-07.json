[noise] we're listening to see how it just Andrew Johnson he describing going into one of Brazil's tore a sleep over\nAnd it tore asleep overcrowded prison the law enforcement and criminal justice professor at metropolitan State University in St Paul Minnesota with doing doctor research\nMy interest is and how people practice their face on the margins society and inmates are really some of the most marginalized people especially in Brazil and there's fear of crime in people's everyday conversation\nAnd some people look at it in me was discussing there isn't the grace or forgiveness extended to them\nBut Johnson says ironically inmates are finding that redemption in the very place they've been cast off to by society behind bars to prison churches\n[noise]\nSpecifically one denomination\nPentecostal is really resonated inside the cell walks much more so than any other faith that I saw and so I learned that Pentecostal as I was really the fee for the inmates\nJohnson is quick to point out that this is not your typical prison ministry these churches are formed an led by the inmates themselves\nStarted inside of prison and are indigenous to those places and a ton of 'em is [noise]\nA scene from a forthcoming documentary if I give my soul faith\nBehind bars in Rio de Janeiro based on Johnson's book of the same name he\nExplains how the Pentecostal isn't the incarcerated runs counter to the popularity of Catholicism in Brazilian society which traditionally represents the establishment\nWhat's the relationship now between the rise of Pentecostal at them and the traditional Afro Brazilian culture and religious tradition\nOh it's it's one of great antagonism and in fact a lot of the neo Pentecostal churches in Brazil\nActually have been persecuting whom bonding condom play in panic hospitals services exercises um is is really important in fact in the second largest Pentecostal denomination Brazil called the universal church of the kingdom of God\nFriday night services are dedicated to exercise and actually caught deliverance but it is really extra system\nAnd the evil spirits in quotes that are being exercised are\nActually the spirits they're called issues of whom binding condom blade so you have a literal demonization of the spirits of Afro Brazilian religion\nSilly and religion which of course sets them up for persecution and so you have lots of cases in which\nGroups the Pentecostal sometimes led by their pastors will go in and raid houses of worship of condom play and owned bond or you have violent Pentecostal gangs in Rio de Janeiro who make sure that there are no operating houses of worship of condom ... bond or\nIn their districts of Rio de Janeiro\nSo yeah unfortunate one of the unfortunate events is is a real kind of persecution\nI Want to just go back to the point that you were making describing the role that the universal church of the kingdom of God it's having can you speak a little bit more to that can you explain to me and give me some understanding of how large is it and where is it having influence\nYes this is that this is a very controversial church founded in the late Nineteen seventies\nUm the church has been targets accused of tax evasion and ... other transgressions of the law which I Can't recall the moment and they are the second largest Pentecostal denomination that country\nAfter the gargantuan assemblies of God who have some ten to twelve million estimated members I think the last I saw this be an estimate of um four to five million members\nThey had been a real pioneer though on the panic hospital see not only in Brazil but throughout Latin America for example they really are the church and Latin America and embracing the U.S style health and wealth gospel our prosperity theology\nAnd they have a whole I think Tuesdays Tuesday worship services are dedicated to those who want to become entrepreneurs and prosper and such\nAnd as in palatable as many people who\nAre not panic hospitals are not evangelicals fine prosperity theology\nFor a lot of working class folks on the ground this idea that you know that was sufficient faith you will be blessed with with both spiritual material blessings is drawing and can lead folks to pursue new avenues that might lead to prosperity\nThere's this huge emphasis on the conversion narrative you know it's saying that you know even if you're in prison even if you or whatever you know terrible crime you've committed there is still a chance to convert and turn your life around\nAnd turn your life around and so uh you know there's been a lot of criticism of oh we'll exploitation of the tie you know making poor folks compelling them to donate ten percent of the church but\nFor for people who really feel like they're able to turn their lives around in a positive way and these churches wild and a ten percent investment and your church might well be worth it I think particularly for Afro Brazilian men\nIt's Pentecostal churches\nThat really allow for the greatest social mobility I met lots of Afro Brazilian pastors who who made really nice career for themselves within the church\nWhere in secular life from Brazil it really would have been difficult because historically you know the main avenues of of social mobility were ah were music soccer and maybe the military\nAt the start of our conversation you describe that\nThe population while they've the Catholics have lost the majority there's still a significant segment of the population what has the reaction of the Catholic Church then to one this shift away of its members it's rank and file towards Protestantism and in particular kind of hostile at them\nOne strategy which has been more successful though apparently not so successful since attend Brazil is no longer majority Catholic was to imitate the Pentecostal competition\nBy promoting the Catholic charismatic renewal\nThe Catholic charismatic renewal is yet another American born movement within the Catholic Church that is basically Catholicism brand of Pentecostal isn't the same emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit the gifts to the Holy Spirit\nPraise music all of that in a recent Pew foundation calling in Brazil\nPew found over sixty percent of Brazilian Catholics to be identifying specifically as as charismatic [noise]\nThat's Andrew chest at an expert at Brazil's religious makeup and a professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth university at the Pentecostal church has grown in Brazil so too has its influence on culture and on politics\nHow our ...

world's biggest Catholic country and Jesus what he's everywhere if you live in Rio like our correspondent Catherine Osborn you can look up from almost anywhere in the city and see yeah\nSome Brazilians call him the big Jesus some Brazilians call him to Christ so I see the Christ statue if I Am\nTaking the metro or the train to between the buildings you look up and you see the Christ between the building I'm running or I'm walking down the beach the Christ statute is a powerful symbol not just of Rio but of Brazil\nAnd Brazil's power in a certain way of who has power in Brazil\nBut things are in flux Catholics may have erected Christ thirty ... but they're no longer the majority and maybe soon out numbered by evangelical Christians in Brazil\nFor years now us style mega churches and tiny storefront ones have been sprouting up in neighborhoods across the country\nAnd us style television journalism has been blaring from Brazilian TV sets evangelical bishop runs Brazil's second biggest television network\n... you'll see from\nEvangelical church has also become a mega political force\nMega political force in part because of sheer numbers but also because of the political opportunity that arose that's according to Virginia Commonwealth university professor Andrew ... not an expert on Brazil's religious make up\nHe says military generals who ruled Brazil in a dictatorship for Twenty one years we're looking for religious support\nIn the beginning the Catholic Church was supportive but quickly within the first three or four years the Catholic Church starts to morph into the most important opposition to the military regime\nAnd so as they develop the bishops are speaking out against the military dictatorship and everything\nThat leaves kind of a vacuum for the panic hospitals to fill in\nAnd kind of serve as giving religious blessing religious benediction to the military regime and I saw that first hand when is it when I was doing my dissertation research and the Amazonian city of ...\nIn which the Catholic bishop would no longer attend a lot of official state ceremonies and that would leave it to the\nThe head pastor pastor president they calm of the local assemblies of God I'm billing\nTo kind of serve as the official state pastor and so throughout Brazil we see this great vacuum this great void left by the Catholic Church and bracing liberation theology becoming opposition and of course the generals are more than happy\nOne clean bill event about early childhood services ended with this recording of ... bellows owed to Rio\nRio is the place where I got it got his diploma a beauty as a candidate could develop promised religion and politics would not now but at this event in his speech he mentions God eight times the Bible once and Israel twice he has also defended creationism\nRight [noise]\nSo I asked him afterwards if primary education in Rio would remain apart from religious influence ...\nJeeze what was going on\nIn the real problems of coexistence among religions don't exist especially in the school system I wear a secular state and people to find the religions for themselves and they're practicing with liberty and\nThen I asked even though you mentioned a God several times in your speech today can you guarantee that the school system in Rio will remain secular\nBoss the President Trump\nLook the day President Trump took office there were services in the morning in the afternoon and at night they sing in all of the churches in the schools have the United states\nAnd there was no kind of indoctrination steak or get you to go through [noise]\n\nAnd so like in America Christian message and continues to ring throughout this nominally secular place\nAt the bellows church continues on what its founder called their quote project of power\nThey may help put an extreme right president into office with implications for everything for maternal health to gun violence because Brazil's religious right isn't getting out of politics anytime soon progressive evangelicals have responded by running for office as well in these elections\nShe's so in Brazilian government as well as in society Christianity will remain view [noise]\nFor interfaith voices I'm Catherine Osborn [noise]\nAs Brazil political and social forces shift right word there's new scrutiny on what cultural
