our freedom of speech\nFreedom to organize in our freedom the fate or a ball and shined in the first amendment and when people live out\nTheir fates practice the values preached well they're often drawn to get involved in their communities and speak out on specific causes like stopping gun violence\nWe were championing the sanctity of human life but the same people were championing the right to take a human life by being armed with a lethal weapon and ready to shoot and kill\nTo combating discrimination to fight for services for an immigrant community\nWhat I learned very quickly that nobody would want to ...\nTo protecting the ability to worship how you want and\nThey come to this belief through quite a bit of thought and they were taking their life and their hands every Sunday at St when they were handling stakes\nTo promoting awareness of the minority faith tradition a lot of people have never even heard of the by faith I'd just be happy if when I say I'm a bribe people don't give me a looked like what [noise]\nSo today we're telling the stories of several people inspired by their beliefs to take us\nFired by their beliefs to take a stand on social issues it's a diverse group at tech entrepreneur turn movie producer an IT professional turned community activist and an anti abortion pastor term gun reform crusader and snake handling pastors turned reality TV stars we\nBegin with Reverend romp shank\nHe rose to prominence among conservative evangelical Christians in the Nineteen nineties through his highly visible political activism against abortion he regularly gathered hundreds of people to blockade abortion clinics even using fetal remains at demonstrations\nAnd his tactics help him become the self described protege leaders within the influential religious right political movement including the late Jerry Falwell senior of the moral majority and Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition\nBut he's since turned away from such activism in part because he felt the extreme rhetoric used by the pro life movement contributed to violence against abortion providers\nToday he has a new mission fighting gun violence and in his new memoir constantly grace he reflects on the many conversions he has undergone throughout his life which began as a member of a reform Jewish congregation\nI was raised in a nominally Jewish Home I was very aware of my Jewish identity\nBut it was a little more complicated than that because my mother had been a convert to Judaism uh born in baptized a Catholic\nRaised in the ... and then chose to become Jewish so that she could marry my father we were not observant uh we attended synagogue on a friday night it was a reformed temple\nAnd really it was a cultural identity a not a terribly religious one so in my late teens I was introduced to the son of a Methodist minister spoke about God and an intensely personal way\nSo these set up this sets up an ethical problem for a Christian\nHow are they responding to that message\nA real mix a real mix of course I Do hear a vigorous defense it's my rights they will go immediately to generally the second amendment it's my right under the constitution to defend myself and my family\nAnother common defense of using lethal force is they will say uh I'm responsible for God to protect my wife and my children it's almost always men although I'm surprised at the number of women who do\nWho do carry weapons\nBut in any case mostly I hear that so there is a ring of patriarchy that I've also felt the need to address\nIn this conversation but then there's a surprising number who say to me you know you really got me thinking about this and a one pastor told me recently that he\nDisposed of all his weapons he got rid of them ... you know there have been other pastors who have confided in me but they're quite worried about the numbers of people now in their views on Sunday who are armed\nYou referenced the elevation of the gun it's become an idle at which we worship\nThis was a really important point for me I realized that what we had on our hands was not just a moral and ethical problem but actually a theological one even a doctrinal\nCrisis because when you reach for something like a gun especially a gun because there's a lot of emotion involved in that there's a lot of fantasy\nMost people imagine that you know if you're going to carry a aside Arbor firearm as soon as the danger presents itself you just whip out the weapon you pointed you fire you neutralize the threat it's all over everybody smiles and pets you on the back as a hero and usually not how it goes it's a fantasy\nThere's a lot of adrenalin people are confused they don't know who's really the danger or if you fire even if the bullet hits\nThe individual may pass through their body and then hit someone else a child somebody else nearby especially in the sanctuary\nAnd there are more and more people who are carrying weapons into sanctuaries now including pastors in the ... I've had friends who tell me I'm armed every Sunday and if somebody so much as stands up and yells there'll be sorry they ever came to church because I'll I'll take them out right from the ... well\nI often ask pastors and what about the little girl and the grandma sitting next to that person and\nSo when when you have those elements you do have the makings of a form of id dollar tree because the instrument becomes a false savior it's the weapon that will save me and we'll save all of us\nI argue with pastors that that's false messiah that's a false savior that to me is a theological problem it's heresy and that's very serious for Bible believing Christians like the ones I keep company with but\nKeep company with but as evidence of that I Know bring out one of the most popular concealed carry holster is in the country\nIt's produced by a company called garrison grip\nAnd to look at it you would think immediately anyone would think this is a very common Bible cover\nIts its black it has silver lettering that says holy Bible there's across on the spine you ... just as a common study Bible we called him a for a typical evangelical my people when you are an separate there are no pages of scripture inside\nIt is not a Bible in fact it is a holster and it can accommodate a semi automatic pistol a add an additional magazine of bullets so but uh you've got all the fire power you need and when I saw\nThat as I said now we've gone from a theoretical idol to a literal idle ...\nThat was Reverend romp shank evangelical pastor activist and author of costs league racing evangelical ministers rediscovering faith hope and love coming up after a short break and when you're a member of the minority group that's already viewed unfavorably why stick your neck out for another marginalized\nCommunity for one woman it's a religious mandate that's next on interfaith voice\nOr a\nCatastrophe on the Florida Panhandle the latest on the clean up and recovery from hurricane

and then the NPR politics show at ten here on NPR\n[noise] [laughter]\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... welcome back to interfaith voices I'm amber con before the break we talked with Reverend\nRob shank an evangelical pastor who lost friends colleagues and the organization he founded to focus on changing gun culture among evangelical Christians gun violence also plays a big role in the next story we're going to tell about another passion project this time in Columbus ohio\n\nIn seven months if you have seven homicides and Seventeen shootings is is that a seat is crisis\nThat's their co opted she's an IT business owner she's a Pakistani immigrant she's a mom and she's Muslim\nYou know I'm a Muslim mother who wants to make sure that you know our children they got us or them with them and non Muslim\nThey are protected the I didn't bothered but she says\nThat wasn't happening in Columbus is hilltop neighborhood where many young people were being recruited into gangs or being killed\nAnd then you are learning that a nine year old shot another and I in order to let any at all for three dollars and then these two kids was visiting from Rochester New York and they would actually invite George into you know to pick up something and\nThey were shot because they had a nice rental car and one kid died right that and other kids died in the hospital\nAnd it means that you know they are drug dealers and criminals who are actually doing all of this and they using a younger children an avid says\nShe was so concerned she dropped everything all of her political community and even some family commitments to work toward a solution [noise] she soon learned that much of the violence was centered in one specific area of the hilltop in an apartment complex known as ... village\nTo village apartment is on the vet said if the numbers these are fifty nine building six hundred and fifty a Bachmann's about proximity to cause in children in this community\nThis complex is home to recent refugees and immigrants many of whom are also Muslim it's a reflection of Columbus is growing diversity in recent years\nYou know you have a few genes from in which on Iran Somalia all different you know countries out there and then you have immigrant population is author of a mix of it and not on the same community you have like I don't know how many dozens of different ethnic city and that are a hundred plus languages as spoken and our Moscow so\nOdd it herself came to the United states twenty five years ago and that experience compelled her to get\nExperience compelled her to get involved as did her face because\nOf the social justice in the prophet Mohammed has told us that he would put out but aid that anybody who is not of his base but it on that the social justice he would put up with everybody he did it in my ... and early time off his night and then he always said he would do it\nSo I followed that I Would collaborated whoever I don't care what is there\nA you know identity what is their feet what is the who the seed with all the luck I Would do anything to provide social justice to people that are now in my community [noise]\nSo she says she assumed many other members of the city's Muslim community particularly those who were well established would want to help out too\nOriginally when we started working be taught me I just had things somebody community and leave us hoping that that showed that somebody does any moms in Moscow decided but what I learned very quickly that nobody would want to come no somebody moms\nOr mosque in other communities helping and that was in the beginning they would show up in the confidence they would show up you know they would hold meetings Wisconsin and other andme ears in other but then nobody is coming to graduate nobody is getting shoulder to these patterns or giving making sense out of what is going on with them\nBut why [noise] Abbott says she got a quick lesson in two hundred year old Somali history going back to the slave trade and the ugly vestiges of that legacy\nNinety percent of this committee is from ... from Somalia which I have learned that there were actually ... and he brought in somebody as lead\nAnd they feel that this is a mandate it's it's not like oh if you just happen to step on his leg while mowing the lawn you know if you shall tick up serpent they see that as a mad and they ... the rest of the pet across the world for not obeying the scripture and they feel this is awful truth that needs to be restored to the church and they are willing to die for [laughter]\nTo see it happen to keep that in practice as it were\nTo hear the rest of our interview with journalist Julia dean about Nick handling panic hospital preachers go to our

Khan we've been sharing the stories of people of different faith traditions pursuing passion projects summer working in their local communities well others want to take their messages worldwide\nFor one man that means a career switch from tech entrepreneur to working on the silver screen Steve\n... says he has no formal filmmaking training but he's now the executive producer of a new documentary called the gate dawn of the high face\nWays that God has chosen to educate humanity spiritually by shutting down these divine teacher from ... from Abraham and most of the Jesus and Mohamed\nThe Baha'i Faith is a monitor you stick tradition founded in Iran in the mid nineteenth century relatively young compared with many world religions ... says the faith community is also relatively small with only about five million members worldwide with less than two hundred thousand in the United states\nAnd because members are forbidden from proselytizing somewhat says most people don't know anything about the fate in fact ... was raised in the reform Jewish tradition only learned about it in his twenties\nHe tells our producer Stephanie ... that it took another nearly Thirty years before he decided to join\nSorrow it says he was most attracted to the high belief that the faith is a continuation of the earliest monitor the stick traditions\nI Love the concept of progressive revelation I didn't like I didn't understand that so I was Jewish and the Christians are wrong or maybe it's\nThe wrong or maybe because there was a lot more questions maybe they were right and I was wrong or maybe the Muslims are right and the questions wrong I just\nDidn't get it and when the ... highest came and said well look maybe everyone's right there's only one God he's progressive Lee revealed the truth the truth is essentially the same and the differences have to do with time and the and the laws\nAnd the social last change over time that just made more sense to me and eventually after twenty some years I got around to actually studying it and when I studied it for a few years I realized I was a by ... by at the age of forty nine three years ago\nAnd then shortly thereafter you got involved in making this film\nThree days after I had to quit is by email my friend a picture of me declaring as the by\nAnd I said I'm a behind now and I told them that I wanted to retire from business and just tell people about the life Athie says well you could do that and reach hundreds of people potentially over the rest of your life or you could make a movie and reach millions\nSaid he wanted to grow the awareness and the ... high faith and share its message and he thought the story of the ... high faith founder the Bob would make for a good movie\nSo with a couple of Hollywood connections and the resources to finance and produced the film sorrow let's recruited Peabody Award winning director Bob Hercules to the project\nHercules says he didn't know much about the high faith its origin story before getting on board\nI realized I didn't really know much about the ... high faith I'd been to the temple a few times I talked to some people\nBut I didn't really know much so I was very intrigued in the story\nWas very powerful to me this this is this the origins of the face of goes back to the Eighteen forties and Persia and uh it was just a an amazing story and I was surprised that nobody had ever made this film before they're just kind of astonishing so uh it's a rare thing\nAs a filmmaker to find a subject that nobody's made these days 'cause documentaries are so popular\nSo we started that you know we it took us\nAbout two and a half years to to make the film\nWell let me how do you tell me an abridged version of the origin story if you will what was cinematic about it that lend itself well to a documentary\nThe stories of Bob I call it the greatest story never told with the story of Jesus being the greatest joy ever told\nIt's very very similar young profit comes to a very harsh environment he has great adulation has thousands flock to him and great tribulation as the religious orthodoxy leaders come down on him and there's\nAnd there was a trial seen very much jail and there's an execution very much like there was when Jesus was quite interesting that Jews Christians and Muslims all over the world and many different places we're all waiting for a messenger the exact time the Bob came in fact the Bob comes in Eighteen forty four which was the same exact year\nThat was the Christian great disappointment in this country a hundred thousand people following a man named William Miller and so we covered that in the beginning part of the movie the Jews also had an expectation around the same time and there are other Christian movements all around the world at that same time at the same time there was a huge Muslim expectation particularly Persia all of purchase waiting for the call it the mom at this time\nSo the time he came as really interesting and the martyrdom at the Bob is tremendously dramatic and that he was shot seven hundred and fifty times\nIn front of a crowd of thousands of people and he very publicly disappeared when the smoke cleared he was not only alive but he wasn't there the Bob survives they find him after a frantic search and his cell and he says oh I've finished my mission now because he had told them before they took him to execute him that\nHe couldn't be killed until he was done with his mission so he says I'm done with my mission you can kill me so they take him they time up again\nThey tie a nice is twenty year old father was going to be killed with him and Sam ... original executioner pulls his entire regiment of seven hundred and fifty people he was Armenian Christian or they get a second regiment in a Muslim regiment in that regiment shot and killed the Bob\nSo it's it's a it's a moment as a mystery how did he's escape where how did he survive that why did he end up in his jail cell you know it's just a and there were thousands of witnesses is not that long ago there were newspaper accounts and things like that\nSense from the faith beginning followers were persecuted still are in many countries today\nAnd they went on two years from now on Eighteen fifty two over twenty thousand of his followers had been killed and only two leaders were left the last surviving leader was ... and he was thrown into a terrible prison called the block pet he was there for four months at a hundred pound chains on his shoulders\nHe was accused of a crime you didn't commit they stole is great wealth burned his home town\nAnd it was in the black pit that ... received his vision from a maid and that he was the promise of all faiths and so he ended up ministry for forty years after this all of it in exile and imprisonment and his messages that just like the Bob it's a very it's really one message from the two of them that is the one is of human kind he says\n... says I've come with the most great piece\nMost great piece we need to get rid of racism of reading rid of sexism rid of nationalism and religious prejudice all these divisions that we thought about for thousands of years he says this is not what Christ was teaching this is not what Mohammed was teaching we're supposed to love each other and he says we will learn to do that and when we do we will have the most great piece\nI Will add to that the message of the Bob was very powerful at the time the unity of religions the idea that we're all alike that were there is no such thing as racism and it sets that everybody is from the same God\nAnd that there should be no strife because of that was very powerful and very controversial message at its time and that's why as Steve said he was persecuted and\nHis followers were severely persecuted\nSo ah it it's really a it's a very dramatic is a very important story I think that people were extremely\nAttracted to his message and the religious leaders were extremely resistant to it\nHow did that the high faith survive given that great persecution right from the beginning of its founding I think\nWhen people realized the transcendence of this message they bring it to other people and so\nIt's almost like a game of walk them all you know they they would kill someone kill another one and not the first one rise up but the truth is so attractive a better question to me would be if this is as compelling as you said as why more people found out about it and I would argue that the religion is tremendously persecuted in many countries today particularly Iran", "show_name": "Interfaith Voices", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "14"}
