professor of comparative religion at California State University Chico she says there are all kinds of stereotypes associated with practitioners of modern paganism\nAnd it's not surprising that in many monotheism traditions the word pagan was and often still is used as a derogatory term\nFor the most part they are anti mystic religion so they believe that the world around us is animated by spiritual power there are\nSo for the most part they are anti mystic religion so they believe that the world around us is animated by spiritual power there are few groups that would describe themselves as being one of the stick but it doesn't tend to be a God that's rare it's it's more likely to be a God us and that's partly an influence of the feminist movement\nSo you have some feminist forms of witchcraft or wiccan particular that really focus on that got us but again they tend to acknowledge that there are other spiritual being out there\nSo well I wouldn't you know narrowly classify them that you know it was all polytheism they tend in that direction and and I guess that's the way that I think of this broad tender umbrella of a modern paganism it as that there are tendencies in trends that many of them share that connect them\nAnd so that would be that animals on that sense of spirit all around us it would include um the focus on the natural world\nThe emphasis on the cycle of the seasons and that's common to almost all on modern pagan traditions\nTalked to me a little bit about how it is organized ... in the United states in particular it is very decentralized especially\nIn the u._s. but really pretty much everywhere there tend to be networks and federations that might cooperate but there's no central body I mean these traditions many of them have no founder\nMany of them have no central sacred text as Judaism Christianity Islam do and even Hinduism which is very diverse has some tax that are shared there's nothing like that in modern paganism so much of it is is based on archaeological records\nAnd reconstruction and re imagination I'm so there's no central organization in these networks I mean let's say there is some ethical issue that comes up\nI'm there tend to be discussions on the Internet um they do have gatherings festivals that many will attend from different traditions so some things get you know discussed there but there is no sort of\nDecision making body that says well you know all pagan groups must be you know must believe this or you know must you know not do this I mean they're they fall across the political spectrum\nThey're really small local groups that can develop their own sort of sense of you know politics if they're interested in that many groups or a political\nWhen I was doing research at contemporary pagan festivals and it's a very diverse community even and and you know those people that would come out to a festival said you know four hundred people among them would be people in

not there would be nurses there would be focusing computer jobs and there would be you know massage therapist and psychic so it's you know very diverse in terms of career in terms of of politics\nIs there a growing interest in modern paganism today and if so what do you think is attributed to that growth\nOne of the trends that's happened is the increasing number of Americans that identifies spiritual but not religious and ... and you know some aspects of pagan traditions with other identities I mean I've met people who were Catholic and pagan I mean they weren't\nNecessarily following the church's teachings but they were still practicing some form of Catholicism in their personal lives but incorporated some pagan elements\nSo I think that's happening a lot these sort of hybrid and multiple spiritual identities particularly in in the U.

placed some fall leaves their uh Garland but just fake we didn't really it's too early in the season to get a lot of fall colored leaves on the back we have three pillars voted candles like the seventies candles and in front of the candles then sort of in the middle of the chest rehab statue of the Greek goddess ...\nFor Seventy is the goddess of spring she's also the queen of the underworld she's the wife of Haiti's so our ritual today is in honor of ... as she descend into the underworld for the colder darker months of the year so she takes place of honor this weekend\nFor us here on the altar space we also have some incense burning stuff like that just to sort of create a little bit more of a spiritual sense here on the altar as well as a political the five pointed star in a circle that we put on the altar which is one of those symbols that are often used by weakens as a symbol of our faith\nBut the main attraction today is the ritual itself David solved variable lead it after all he wrote the script that will be used he says the main theme for this year's ritual is recognizing one's own lightness and darkness\nAnd many religious traditions and wonderful spiritual traditions around the world one's inner darkness is something that\nShould either be ignored or even banished discarded and you know the goal is to evolve pasture darkness but in the craft we'd try to avoid anything that just cards are power right so nothing within offices profane including our darkness and the darkness can teach us a lot\nOf the dark part of the year is often a lot about you know
