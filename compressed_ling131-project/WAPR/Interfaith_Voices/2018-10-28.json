own was noting a lot of people on the more conservative side are just absolutely thrilled with action taken over the last two years in those areas are religious freedom is something I cover a lot but it excitement about the type of initiatives we saw here in the U.S around the world and so you're saying\nGet out and vote because we love these guys and we're going to keep them in office and keep people like them in office whereas on them more on progressive people if the\nIn those communities it's like we're upset about the way Muslims are treated for example and other people have minority

about a values voter\nStill vaccinating where we think about a values voter sort of the traditional definition was the more conservative religious person that was very concerned about abortion laws

Republican religiously unaffiliated voters being more democratic they tend to skate more toward their partisan polls are the last couple of years and so that's where ... who ends up turning out\nMay make the difference absolutely I mean it's worth remembering in the last midterm election it was the lowest turn out that we've seen since the early part of the twenty century you have to go back a long long way decades and decades the turnout overall was really just in the thirties only Nineteen percent of young people turned out in the last midterm election\nSo if we it looks like a low turnout election like that\nAny group that can get its supporters out can make a big difference because overall the bar set pretty low\nSo these two polls as Jones calls them that sit arguably on the opposite ends of the political and faith spectrums white evangelical voters and the religiously unaffiliated\nCould be key to who takes the mid term elections but Jones explains the religiously unaffiliated have drastically different voting habits from evangelicals\nDuring an increasingly large group and the American landscape that make up about twenty five percent of Americans\nToday they tend to lean democratic and both presidential and mid term elections they in fact that vote about seven intend to Seventy five percent democratic\nThe ... it would give is that even though there are a growing proportion of the population they tend not to turn out at rates comparable to uh other Americans so they're underrepresented at the polls they have never broken a ... to be out to be bigger than twelve percent\nOf voters so they're about fifty percent underrepresented\nAt the polls we have the opposite actually among religiously affiliated voters particularly among white Christian voters they tend to turn out at rates higher than their proportion or in the population so for example what even jello Protestants today I had been shrinking\nAh they're down to now about Fifteen Percent of the population but they are upwards of twenty twenty five percent of voters so they're considerably over represented\n[noise]\nMe have a major major turnout and evangelicals in the unaffiliated and that's something we have to change\nThat Sarah eleven sheets the director of grassroots and community programs at the secular coalition for America and she spoke with that the U.S guide\nShe says the coalition wants to see the ...\nAny programs at the secular coalition for America and she spoke with us via Skype\nShe says the coalition wants to see the religiously unaffiliated be voting bloc like evangelicals supported by politicians and political parties\nThey make thoughts on their campaign trail to the different constituency groups that they feel are important to talk to 'em to get on board for their ... and we want the secular community to be among them\nThe secular movement is still fairly young Lebanon says the coalition she works with is only Fifteen Years old itself she says there had been past efforts to activate the religiously unaffiliated like the reason rally in two thousand twelve\nWell it attracted several thousand people to the national mall the excitement of generated did not translate into getting the vote out\nLevin says that's why this year the secular coalition for America launched its first voter turnout campaign along with several other secular atheist humanist groups called secular America votes\nI'm very encouraged by recent reports I've seen that there's a surge and political engagement particularly around around 'em there Portland centered on secular Democrats\nBut we will have to make sure that that engagement isn't limited to attending rallies and posting on Facebook because you have to bring that to the late to the issue you have to have conversations with family and friends neighbors about issues and that and you know as well but\nAt the end of the day we have to make sure that the religious than affiliated or coming to this whole\nIndeed Jones from P. R. R. I. says his organization released data recently that indicates these voter mobilization efforts maybe working\nWhat we found is that about fifty three percent of the ... the unaffiliated tell us that they're going to vote in the mid term so that would be significantly higher than they've ever turned out now I should say this or self reported numbers so they're always lower you know these are aspirational numbers and so you want to discount them\nA bit but they look about like the general population right so if they turned out at rates comparable to the general population\nThat would actually be something quite new in fact if religiously unaffiliated voters did begin to turn out regularly it would absolutely change the ... election calculus of both political parties\nBut the secular coalition Sarah eleven says part of a challenge in motivating the potential bloc of voters is that many religiously affiliated people don't recognize a shared identity\nHave to get folks to identify as a ... seats in ... when the Soviets\nAn affiliated people don't recognize a shared identity\nYou have to get folks to identify as a constituency to mobilize them as the constituencies that we have more work to do on that front to get more people to take stock of their value system and feel proud of it and take ownership of it\nWe have to present a vision of values that people can kind of articulate and identified with\nThat's why religiously unaffiliated groups like eleventh secular coalition have also created a campaign called secular values voters it effort to help this demographic articulate their shared agenda\nWe believe that secular values are American values and the way that we think about freedom and inclusion inequality knowledge we feel is a compelling direction for the country's going in the values that unite us it's the idea that religion and government should be separate that our government strict serve all\nFace and no faith it's one that protect beliefs but never imposes among others it's one that believes and equal rights but also\nEqual responsibility that we don't have religious carve outs for\nPublic health and safety laws\nLebanon says many people if they can also get on board with the value of religious freedom\nIt is not a license to allow whoever happens to be the majority religion at the time to implement that set of beliefs\nOn all other American living says for many religiously unaffiliated voters this nascent idea of a political identity is knew\nI had so many interactions where it was like the light bulb went off in their head and it was also a sense of relief because they agreed with the values but they had never had a chance or the tools to articulate them\nTo their peers and the party to their family members because we're constantly bombarded with this message that we have no values that we are not\nMoral people that we don't stand for anything that all we are\nAre just a bunch of people who don't believe in God and that just couldn't be farther from the truth\nLoving says the coalition and its partner organizations have held registration drives and twelve states ended trainings in twenty living says states varying registration deadlines were the major challenge in her group's nationwide voter mobilization campaign but she has already looking to the future\nWe're playing the long game here this is a five year tenure visions of what it is going to take to be a powerhouse constituency that recognized is respected and its influential\nIn the course of her voter mobilization work around the ...\nHow are how can that you can see that recognized is respected and influential\nIn the course of her voter mobilization work around the country the secular coalition Sarah eleven says she made an interesting observation\nSome of them energized people in terms of the religiously unaffiliated in the United states are in the in the most active the MEK an American vote this year when in\nNew York times reporter Elizabeth dying earlier this month wrote about the race between incumbent US Senator Ted Cruz and democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nShe producers Stephanie ... how her reporting uncovered an unlikely source of support for work from white evangelical women she begins by explaining what this Texas re signifies on a national level\nThese are the ones that will really make or break you know who controls the Senate and Texas is one of those and", "show_name": "Interfaith Voices", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "28"}
