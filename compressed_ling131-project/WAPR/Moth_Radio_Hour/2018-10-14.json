that we tell ourselves and how random everything is and how\nIs and how random comes for innocent children every day all over the world\nAnd earlier I connected the dots and I told myself a story that saved his life got him to the hospital and it got him treatment at a time when he could have died\nAnd then later on in all the agony and the fear and the despair and the guilt I told myself another story and I connected the dots in another way that made me to blame\nAnd I got two appointed mob and that\nWas like why do we tell ourselves these stories and why does so many of her story slip into go stories and I realized the only control I had over the situation my own personal San trivia\nWas to let go of the story that I needed to tell myself and live more like Emily had said in our town to realize life every every minute\nAnd when I woke up the next morning it was like a\nAnd beautiful and clear winter day and Ella started talking about the black bird and I'm like let's go to the

inside you much chew it and let's swallow it so that we can have it for later and it can always be with us and we started to eat the day my family and one day Ella walked in you know to the boys' room and she's like knives gone and I already knew that now it's gone because I felt it\nAnd I felt this dark spirits lift from our\nHouse when I stopped connecting the dots\nAnd I thought about the only other line that I remember from our town something I always thought was so beautiful and I think about it every time I Try to tell a big story and I realize what we really need most often are just postcards just moments\nAnd there was a beautiful moment in our town before Emily died and found herself in a cemetery and when she was falling in love and somebody sent a postcard to her fiance to beads little sister\nAnd I think of it addressed to my son Linus\nAnecdotes Linus Redmond three sixty four Washington avenue\nBrooklyn New York\nThe United states of America the planet earth the solar

fabulous my son is now a brilliant witty very sarcastic fourteen year old boy and uh the whole family's doing great he just started high school\nAnd having gone through this experience is is there any good but you got out of it\nWell you know there's always this kind of sort of Damocles hanging over your family there's always the dark cloud and you always have to be vigilant but I think it really taught the entire family to just appreciate what we have and don't look too far into the future um and be incredibly grateful\nYou know you were telling a story about appreciating every moment of life and actually all the stories told them the graveyard that were really about the\nThe graveyard as a venue to tell this story about the appreciation of life but it does it make a richer\nI think so well number one I'm southern so you know graveyards have a huge place in our culture it's like you tell stories in graveyards you make out in graveyards and so it seemed perfect tell them off during the graveyard\nBut I'm One of the things about having a baby that's diagnosed with cancer you know he was only three months old when he was diagnosed as you are stripped of the illusion of this Seventy six Seventy eight years of life being real you realize front and center we are all born to die\nAnd there's just no more illusion about it you know he didn't do anything to cause this it's just this is what's coming for every single one of us\nSo telling the story in the graveyard and sort of like celebrating my son's life and being there with this remarkable audience and you and my
