has to come do this at the players got it in front of two hundred and fifty people instead of twenty five and then lessen the bless your heart you did agree to do that and did it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of the whatever\nMight happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact\nA lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but

um but also because it's long been obvious to me the card counter reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] presents a piece of ID to a person in the casino\nHe can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they

here [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man and I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and to know books and pens and a few thousand dollars and I went to\nBosnia during the civil war the story of all to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying mores of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war\nIt was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken\nBy surprise military forces\nAre and ... they took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd when I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained\nFor um\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die\nPrepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out at the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle\nIn front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ...\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole the bullet\nComes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot like another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well\nAll these little black holes are staring at us I thought there's attorney inside those holes and they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war\nAnd sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nThis time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was ...\nIt was called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nWhat's the math on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking unit everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags or gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof Bessie grabs his stuff is throwing a mode of soldiers 'cause the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine\nI'm not scared any more Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know\nWar might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nThat would have been mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of he allowed So Tim took the next trip\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up\nUp in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded at one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that Tim broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by daughter were going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared\nTo walk all night on a broken leg was for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it you got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment um and er nothing you know the rest of his okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "28"}
