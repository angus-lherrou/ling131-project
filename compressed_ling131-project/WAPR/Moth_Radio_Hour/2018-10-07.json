live at the [noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on\nKeep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college\nMary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was\nBorn and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile\nDoing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both\nAnd America American\nErica American [noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents\nAnd it's the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho every rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought\nI couldn't ask that question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAnd moon line a cartoon character [noise]\nSo excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all of these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest went through his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people are now saying\nIf this happened to this guy Vincent Chin\nAnd this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American Asian American I'd never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together\nSo my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching the documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... and says\nThat's your family\nWhat\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related to ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask about a murder man and our family I had nothing\nTo say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother little each in ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured\nAt her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nSome moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nIt's like my grandmother my maternal grandmother and she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself\nI have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is in the my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family\nOf someone who spoke up\nTo be a bought again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each\nIn and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where ... lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit\nMy friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to ... grave we she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on a tombstone and little each and husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go the next states in my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first aunts\nA few years after the story morally moved out of New York city and back to Colorado where she got a place with a lot more states though she got herself a matching large try a
