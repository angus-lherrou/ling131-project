is she's just an opera singer right in opera is all about spectacle you know eighty people from the stage and horses and of vengeance and be grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it isn't as simple as pot imaginable there's literally no movement in the spot if someone were to stage this as an opera\nHow would that go [laughter]\nUm it might be minimalist music actually a right\nLike just repeating theme over and over and over again\nWith me yelling help\n\nAnd you know people say those kinds of things and interviews and then I put the quarter to be under the story and it makes it nice and they put a little pinky music under it and maybe
