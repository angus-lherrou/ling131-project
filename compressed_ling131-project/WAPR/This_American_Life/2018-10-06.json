H. P. R.\nCute PR myself shows W. H. I. L.\nMovie W A L F in Tuscaloosa\nW T two three ... Tuscaloosa every tasteful\nStill I have now we are we are we are we we are Alabama public radio [noise]\n\nRemember in the news was boring politics is boring that happen right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years where\nRed America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nTo me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so\nEmotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting and then sent that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state the vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats disbelieve with the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation in our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on\nA man's life or death [noise] with no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBoth those people having to make these huge decisions\nThey are not comfortable with all [noise] W. easy Chicago this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\n[noise] but [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned on the TV and you'd see is tortured face he dragged his decisions down to the ...\nIt's down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem like a no on Kavanaugh was yes and was let's wait a week is if we can made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than it was a yes again\nProducers do we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake of last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording it for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay the big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed its mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't as clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote and now he was stuff\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flicking declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that he was confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\nArgentina was one of the two women and that confrontation that her play good morning good morning when that elevator door closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[noise]\nEr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site support the heroes who convinced flake raised over thirty thousand dollars and a couple of days [noise] lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching to see\nWeeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see here so I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning and he's also we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a it\nWas the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of the story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nEasily to Portland\nWe support what do you believe we went one way and therefore we believe women were you\nWhen you think you can't replace what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nClever Evan is er into this\nDid it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe sleek making fun of himself we've talked about before\nLike lots of men his age she doesn't connect to well to emotion [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a deal like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as I'm sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's always got a I Would just urge colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one\nTwenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't as off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat um it's been it's just it's a ... debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that oh it was pretty raw you know [noise]\n... next morning of course like finally releases the statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the ... to come back to\nSettle for something a bit of ...\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and he gets the news that flake the yes\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens a Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something\nThat is not appropriate here as soon as ... votes\nFriday he fled the capital I talk to them in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am and presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied with the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with them you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that's a terrible temper only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no aisle to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nVery chase ... program which turned out it is a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through\nWell I like my own uh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act and the political away\nThe frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n[laughter]\nYou should ask\nIs whether the judge has the temperament commitment and\nThe judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with politic\nIt was political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful not to [noise]\n... southern southern southern so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asking bed a staple cases you always wanted to be on the Supreme Court you know by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works\nUm just the nine of us and uh\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge it to the\nAnd if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of all\nWe realize one of us will have\nTo write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAre an opinion that explains\nThe teach the principles of\nWar the principles of the constitution that controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case uh we draw down on a capital of trust\nWe make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nMy story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how we talk about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both it was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all\nAnd if they are very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have a separate playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious dirty I hear some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I'd lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is that I have a one six pack brave and it just expect [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack [noise]\nThanks to reform club the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete

are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan is the kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI sock incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone\nTo choose life imprisonment when in fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole [noise]\nThat would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed [noise]\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness Shia driven me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing\nAnd knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nTo begin to apply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers than to just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really rug things are\n\nA few months after ... men receive Maryland's email an execution date with that the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glenn injured at the cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want\nPaul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to an hour show and it's even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you and ...\nHas acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too\nForward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of ... Berger about a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShe also forwards originally email just fan once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nSome expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nCartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\nDidn't represents joking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering or food that she can stop refusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea know\nMaryland is colon stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of what her life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSince the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about a safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain the people closest\nRemain the people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our politics the cause of all of this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not gonna ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPaul's appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nSo that's a hard thing\nI'm In I'm\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family of all moved on to win Maryland rent fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that since\nThe death penalty\nI had that I I thought I had literally died they didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody's they assume that if you involved in a heinous crime that the two monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\nYou know okay so she's going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk\nFor us I think probably more than ... ... as the ... and it's been a fan\n[laughter]\nHope I get that before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend is at the door [noise]\nAnd then I'm John and it's very nice things going on here right now how do you\nSpend your ... okay\nI get a lot of trouble vent lingers in the door the hotel room\nSit down and a half feet over there uh\nHe's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous and so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in fan and been in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lab\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even began to her letters or never went anywhere I I don't know what to say what did you say about that I don't want to write a letter
