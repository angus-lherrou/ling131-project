H. P. R.\nCute the art shows\nH. I. L. movie W A L F in Tuscaloosa W\nW two to three busy Tuscaloosa\n... name though we are we are we are we are we are Alabama public radio [noise]\n\nIt's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with their guns French and the boxes\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio there's that his record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only two teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year was pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw that brought a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from writings that he fired during these drills so\nThe first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the ... you had to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing to shoot [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve [noise]\nHe's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise]\nHe's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking you told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings another kid details nothing nothing this way [noise]\nAwareness and the elementary when [noise]\n\n\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... first keys and he's trying to find the right one\nSays revving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\n\nAll right here we go [noise] and we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat was an attorney and compare to the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them I I talked to John\nThe principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time to shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target pills close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get\nYou have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss\nThere's a possibility if somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise] I I wouldn't have believed [noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise]\nThese shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it looks in past to just be the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough actually we have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago it's this American I Am Ira Glass [noise] stay with us [noise]\n[noise]\n... Glen ... will never be\nPretty sure that's trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nJust a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more for parents work day I mean they knew what it is\nStill even with that we still\nHave the same people that are going to retire\nPeople that aren't going to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question one of our producers Robin semi in winter park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is at school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the old school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period forever and this is what a code black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were apps and non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nUnless it's as her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in their classroom doors of paper\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshman building looking terrified\nYou know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in a doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nThat are running towards the freshman building um\nI'm ... and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was and what happened\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n[laughter]\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder you kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group it small enough to fit in a supply of car that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and\nShe'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark except students faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was grades in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway I'm without really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um\nThat was happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was I kind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shooter saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] what's it told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know it's gonna be able to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStates these the teacher who's our most grazed she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway be\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills\nOf any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study\nThey both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I moved out to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one of trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas\nOn Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills at Xavier University and as a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much\nIt's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms\nAlso ...\nAll the codes their colors and meanings can films I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes at all I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked ... [noise] but the idea that this is all you do [noise] that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you Daniel room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight [noise] basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her about actually occurs how sheets dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids\nThe problem with this and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids into her room\nOr to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school button I\nWhen I asked her what the drill is four she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nA classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all\nThat have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids\nWe don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nI wanted to know about barricaded\nAnd I want to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because it's a thing to reckon with\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school shows point about don't take codes\nHe said she always tried to be strict with him the can never keep coming up front for very long\nJust breeze taken nice the press he can nice the rare\n\nBreed with me [laughter] [noise]\n\nAfter a few minutes he cut his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shooting stops you want to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears and start feeling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know the evidence is going on in this world that can go through with this ... because they're strictly drugs drugs doors are still able to get it and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns\nIn tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stock a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivor it's when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns\nThere's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips that son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get\nThe FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail cell hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nAfter watching Loni in Sandy in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's prime called Sandy from the theater\nMinute I picked up the phone there was [noise] [noise] screaming [noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about\nAbout cars Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were injured\nAnd then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook were twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings at that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous\nUncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband when we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nThat looked like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nWanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filled suicide there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings too\nSome other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moments that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts on what to do when your child dies in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light ... rather should they should you know Seamus you were should you know let me explain children you're right I'm not the same person on there will be they see it as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial [noise]\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting in Parkland\nOn a kitten that store at I met them at their house there is something was Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on its when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitch said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person\nSaid they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and other set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nTime the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling for somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find yourself\nTo find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning we see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like screams from these rooms\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find your son you know and that whole thought that he was somewhere else and I'm taking keep I'm thinking maybe he walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house\nAnd then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at it injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an E R nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas cage to swim or oh this one was perfect [noise] I think is meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like he was able to perfect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city":
