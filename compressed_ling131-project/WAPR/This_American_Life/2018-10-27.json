Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\n[noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhen you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing

gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like the story from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it onto the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIndustry about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is it
