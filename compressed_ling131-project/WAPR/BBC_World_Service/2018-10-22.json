then you just kind of move on and say well I did\nMy best can prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well\nSame ideology

get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss\nUsed his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets so flawed the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students\nThe markets basically worked

I Believe that I live alone all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but they will be men and women and some people in between\nNow and there's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I don't mind full on ... not so long ago we spoke to a woman code ritual dollars ... who\nIs all white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and live a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents\nIt became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say we won't be\nBecause people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say what being black is and she said look I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and and others I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of your own race all on the air and races a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's but you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel ... didn't do which is they've\nCreated a movement to allow them\nTo be what they want to be an artist and they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I basking in the I'd be happy because it obviously very important to them\nIf racial they'll they'll have could have provided a could have made these arguments on the side of the people in the gum the thing and if you could have done it in the way that was a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that but unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm interest I'm willing to listen to her arguments and doing it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you'd have been very consistent saying it's not my job\nTo fix the society is simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nI think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identities leads to to hostility and hatred and division that's the thing that one's looking for\nFor that I think some things can be said or but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is ...\nThat's the thing that one's looking for\nFor that I think some things can be sent a but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less ... than the president said don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which she only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among\n'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people have all the major kind\nAnd do things with them that's not about race or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about\nUm you know building something in the community together worked together with people because I think working together with people of diverse identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly is to have false ideas about them as long as the falls idealism leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people that false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and the ... and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nThe final thought we have a a thinker and writer in the United kingdom kingdom David good heart who said that these days the most important distinction and identity that that one can
