the little uh we're talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often old American radio and TV channels sound ice walking great ching a lump to test the system which in theory would be used with Louis everyone to a threat to\nOversee we don't want to cause any alone by playing the alarm so we're just going to talk about the alone there's a new addition to it to keep up with\nThere's a new addition to it to keep up with the times a text message or let a fourteen twenty later today everyone\nAnd we mean literally everyone is going to receive a presidential election it's a text from the president and it's the first test of the ... of the emergency alert system you cannot opt out\nThe moves however is and supported by everyone that there were some interesting issues behind this and history as well and we got it from Andrew ... who is with Harvard Kennedy School bell ...\nThe alert system has been around for about fifty five years as a way for the president to quickly send a short message to the nation and the case of pretty much only sudden nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish that message\nUm that message was always going to be carried on radio and television\nAnd most Americans will probably recognize the shrill attention tone that broadcast from the regular tested it had been going on right sought tomorrow's different because tomorrow will be the first time a system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used for\nIts interesting isn't it though because cell phone's been around for a while this is if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually a implemented as a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say the civil defense status that is\nThe emergency alert system needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the prison walls will do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirements um the Federal Communications commission\nOr in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the or more just yet where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... and they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that this is a test of the system of the of the emergency broadcast system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when the news and on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nLike a cultural thing this is a trunk so there'd be Americans know the last side America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch [noise]\nUh no I I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think that having that happen right the first one is that is legal they did set this up to say there is a way\nTo use this and it's only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically\nWouldn't be illegal now a lotta people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down the legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal eyes that country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House and in Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least\nI don't think that it would be like his Twitter account where he is on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly unfiltered by the emergency management um uh people uh presumably Yukon reply to this tax\nWrite and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message\nEither in farce or in you know ... to the entire country\nIn the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble would address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this\nThis is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nThat are coming from the you know are we going to get all caps smoke for example well this is this is the thing I'm an ... in fact well walked onto another people are interested eaten is the kind of the fact that many people who have a ... to the current occupy of the White House will just kind of go I don't want to miss the president's going to ignore it\nEven when it could be quite important unlike wants to somebody else\n... ... and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House the other half of America would possibly avoid it as well as he was saying\nUm it just feels as the president count really send a personal message\nBut bear in mind that these folks Saddam's do actually happened to me the Hawaii that there was like a ... there was
