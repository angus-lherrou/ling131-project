do is we run parallel experiments we run experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one another and then we say OK events either happened more frequently or more intense or none of the above and the current climate relative to that parallel simulation of the past climate\nThe American Meteorological Society approaches methodical and cautious with analyses being invited from ... off to the has finished and then with cycles of review and number crunching to follow the assessment for twenty Seventeen is only now taking shape\nAnd we won't know what they will make two in the Eighteen until December next year\nBut the appraisal of twenty sixteen the followed up by the strongest El Nino event in two decades makes it interesting reading\nThe extreme warms across Asia warm studies said would not have been possible without climate change floods in central China the lead to two hundred and fifty seven deaths in twenty two billion dollars of damage were found to be influenced\nMitch was found to be influenced by global warming attempts to solve the climate fingerprint in France drowsy in southern Africa in the deadly bleaching of Australia's great Barrier Reef following a prolonged marine fee to have an in a European air pollution crisis that led to vehicle bands in Paris and elsewhere\nBut looking back over the series of reports and they ... trends stand out\nOh temperature no doubt a temperature the increasing the likelihood of daily extremes five daily extreme seasonally extremes\nThat right there is a pretty unequivocal at this point we have pretty high confidence in those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes\nThat right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that we have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\nFrom a well\n\n\nKnown that quite a\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains a several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles were suggesting we were heading for some of the coma\nLet me issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event as it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms so for those\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale fool wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great so long can you heard of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal ... Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nWe basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial ...\nFrom our forecast initialized nation so that when we run these modify forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still fall out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\n[noise] it's marginal changes to the Atlantic look potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months see ...\nSea ice is declining rapidly moping faucet most summers and recovery more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the opposite between Alaska and seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up and I can't and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these ... and I said maybe a meter sick and you're hoping that it was still survive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Selma", "day": "07"}
