money the public money certainly paved the way as it as it almost always does\nAnd with those points of inside the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space\nRealization of space and expanding human society to to new places what are you going to mine from a space mining standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things in transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge do a who's who may one right water or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first talk it used to be about\nYou know water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I the water can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit and top it off\nAnd take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like\nQuantity that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen I\nCan get the idea here 'cause there'll be a potential so the station in space for a gas station in space for these ... ships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term ... because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from a fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of a an eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shooting them spaces\nIs actually only a tiny fraction of the cost of the overall mission so he's he's a few really the deliverable that everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in his permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttle from the surface of the earth but maybe when that show gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need a ... colony first I mean or at least in an active from sort of industry on a ... a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg\nSpace is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects a multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for a hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue in value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuick question if you you go you got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we wanted to do in the loop besides but it hasn't gone by then and there's not going to be back for several decades\nOr that is one of the challenges of working with afterwards as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space money we see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons\nSo with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for\nHow soon will this happen it's happening now how soon are you going to have a ... starting to prospect on that particular restaurant\nThe first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions the commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nAbout five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but or five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale mind\nChristmas ... here

essentially as\nYou said what happens objects when they fall into a black hole where does the information about these objects\nAnd usually we think that from the outside you can't tell anything about what's inside the black hole and they want something flew into a black hole who information about it pays me last forever and what we've been trying to do is to um traces information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you\nWell we're not definitely not that we we we want to step forward I'd say we've shown that I'm so there's a way of describing this mission in a black hole and not schooled entropy and we've shown that there was a way that we can calculate this entropy and but this is this is just one step along the road\nRight\nAnd what's next them because I I suppose my next question is can you go further without that remarkable brain\nWell it's\nI mean it's going to be difficult Steven hat and a multiple intuition and amazing inside and he would often
