country is still a major producer and\nExposure of oil and gas on the real story this week we're debating Norway's energy future what\nA country that square and rich on the proceeds of oil be prepared

of Norwegian oil and gas which is an industry buddy\nAnd their Christ office and associate professor of political joke of the University of Trump say well can you will I Want to begin by asking each if you how strong which you say a new ways green credentials Kerry and his ... well I\nDo believe that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention what a\nVarious political parties have done the wreck the several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Kent Goodman says\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a major leaked towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country bitter into the CEO to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on how\nAll this ah green technology development\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... the new region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth in energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nThis this is not the view that shaped by much the new region public that actually ... we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out to me from the ground and where the good guys and all of this\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in a way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in LA\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift\nJust because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing false ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy and seeing a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the Norwegian government be grunting new exploration licenses for it and places like the pirates see in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and Main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe it's sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate got submissions\nCan come and says well I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah those are\nMy point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil there will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah do all\nThe stuff is in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh if\nOr if I can draw next ... find out what's next incident and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt well the thing that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good ...\nI Would look at the time frame ... college but says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say that still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to\nMake shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent or this was a huge huge drop ...\nOn on how well do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that he lied to know where he smoked and we've been debating a those are\nThose numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built in ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow want us to anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in Norway but it's become easy I've I've been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and it's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think that well because\nWell because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of who we are and how we identify herself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince is kind of\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get the ... do so well uh you get to perhaps\nIf you're a lucky from ah organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making some of our lands part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay\nOr at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions they stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold and it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do and we can do because we are in the situation we are\nOf you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and and we are in that situation in Norway led effort political party actually agree on it and let me just explain what we need ... sorry and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the seals on life\n... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government didn't no way are shifting governments have spent quite a lot a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and CCF has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater than it gets I don't think when you were saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less and know what you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story a BBC dull capital U. K. and you can subscribe to the ... such the b._b._c. the real story you will punt call stop\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact with support from\nBeard financial Parker guarding families businesses communities and institutions since Nineteen Nineteen or W Baird dot com has more information\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at but together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if we think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign certain areas certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries and what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... with creating a market for any technology we should do that\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and ships because we're a shift nation and I was so very cause of\nAn I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists may or may actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can come into\nFault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to the degree and shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to I think you've made that I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe\nI truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that you and your energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's a problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new wage gap say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president's there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the burn seat comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat you can argue that new region energy as clean as some people might not reason to buying it but also that it means that the way the counterweight to lead powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nFor the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of that's\nExpression ever that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat it does it according to the carbon projects and if you see the court and Brazil has been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the current price is high in Europe I guess we'll exclude coal we've recorded layer you mean\nBy that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but on the market\nAnd there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coupons in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out renewables\nThat he's still a ... would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid to be able to corporate pressing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd since renewable energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting guests to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth they said that the picture that we're looking at\nI won't touch a little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people as much as the the way which treats citizens for the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it were on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it well see but with no way somehow lose some of the states is no way\nAfraid perhaps on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you're painting a far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the ... only plays in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins\nAnd so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and thank God we didn't have an ability we we have a military and since I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective that's happened and I think senator it's supposed to keep a moderate pace of the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards we almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nTo blues

approve him\nHis confirmation would kill to America's highest court in favor of conservatives who has the final say on issues such as abortion on gun control judge Kavanaugh won the backing of key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations\nIn a public hearing last week professor Christine Blasey Ford said she'd been assaulted by judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in Nineteen eighty to judge Kavanaugh denied the claim an allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss of the time this in a feisty confrontation with senators\nThe Republican Senator Susan Collins who is a key swing votes in the confirmation process that said she doesn't believe the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh are strong enough to stop his confirmation as as

a final vote on whether he will join the nine member panel is shed you'll for Saturday and it can ... the position is ...\nFor life so unless one or more Senate has a last minute change of heart Brett Kavanaugh will take a seat on the Supreme Court but as Republican Senator John Kennedy explained the struggle to get the judge elected has done real damage to the credibility of America's top cold\nI think for [noise]\nUnfortunately was viewed by many Americans even before this is what\nThe law was seen as politics practice in a different way and\nAnd the springboard I don't think it really like

city is we have two individuals effectively voting against their parties so we have for the Republicans Lisa Murkowski she says that she is not\nGoing to support the judge Kavanaugh on the other hand we have Joe Manchin the Democrats who's going the other way and he says he will support judge Calvin up sewers things stand that effectively leaves the Senate as it is within comes in each other large so us us things done at the moment it will be fifty one vote sort of a hundred for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that means he is likely to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAre there any other figures to

in the remaining constitution or so they would need to turn out to ... percent of the remaining electric the electric close to Nineteen million so effectively they would need\nFive point seven million

question is the turnout one I mentioned in the introduction\nPhase of hatred beings that off of it increased discrimination is that already evidence of that happening\nThere is I mean I'm under the remaining civil code a gay marriage is already not possible so basically there's a contradiction here with the constitution which the draft is um and backers of this referendum is trying to iron out would already gay people in Romania\nAs in many countries in Eastern Europe feel that not welcome they're ostracized I'm\nThere have been cases of uh graffiti being painted on ... and and just in

I'm trying to make the more powerful that became they reach date a threshold set point at which they couldn't increase the pilot anymore because the power and intensity and the team would break the equipment the optics and the merits that you're trying to build with\nSo they needed a technique that could boost the energy while keeping it but what we call the damage threshold\nOn the application of this I was rooting for example laser therapy targeting cancer corrective laser surgery it comes into those kinds of world's deserve\nIt paved the way for building pulses of light which could have a

I mean you you use the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the Kremlin when you look at president\n... ... for example you just look very embarrassed\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether it was\nYour behind the scenes that maybe people looking at a red faced\nI'm sure they didn't receive than use our happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you're trying to show off your and your skin and then you get called in and it's something like that at a time that's not really a great day for you\nAre but that's also like to see like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever they're called I never there's an accusation as old as denial it's always like you know are they walk or the or the investigations they always say there's no blues over your city although we did see you know the force by taking pictures and all of these things\nSo that's that's not really surprising thing\nFor them not just as as I said I Do find that I'm finished that it it it is creeping into our everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that a lot of pushback against the standards\nI think that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life it's practice something we call digital hygiene so very small things such as like you know a a changing your passwords often backing up your data\nA little bit kind of like vigilant and care for how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your a door open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like practice nice minimal things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um a dish that hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the ... crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir like the sophisticated level of sophistication\nAnd almost geopolitical level do you see any sort of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level\nSo late to this this month Russia or as manning on submitting to draft a constitution\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for house they should behave with a to get a you know each other into cyberspace but also one or two adjusting and you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been a limited by the concept of Europe so obviously there's a lot going on on\nThe there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday\nAnd I think um so the Russian activity and like you know a they wanted to separate messy but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that they ought to paying something and the information every now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals they've got that on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against these additives are so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you know that are not you know Russia or China or like with the states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided the kind of like you know to as best I Know you could easily argue that point\nThank you very much for coming in any way to attack May of ... you're listening to the b._b._c.

it's been a year since allegations of sexual abuse against many women over many years by the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein first hit the headlines the outrage these provoked in Sparta huge wave of support for the me too movement across the world\nGoing to hear now about the impact in China of women speaking out against abuse and Harris meant\nIn twenty Fifteen a group of campaigners who became known as the feminist five were sent to jail for several weeks off to handing out feminist leaflets\nThe American journalist and writer later Hong Fincher has been following this story and the

in England a laser welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me at\nDescribed the feminist five fifth vote to a little bit more about the\nShore um oh well in twenty fifth Cain there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China and wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers\nAt subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around at a rest in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women today Jane where they put them in detention\nThem in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually prevented an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... so the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as William preview unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nA much more broadly defined clearly are the ones who've made headlines for the reasons you just described how much will be representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise] well\nThis is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected\nOr by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism um but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally the ... would do as well I'm Emma may be a question too\nOf course I miss it and I wondered so you said it's going today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to kind of on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there is very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China have virtually\nHave virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women emerging up all across China um across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being censored from my own\nWell they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the meat to hash tag so there are definitely stories that are getting through\n'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when I made to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activists came up with the idea of using him oh jeez\nI'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging me too\n[laughter] I should get around and at at work for a while but then the ... [laughter] right Patricia\nI'm just wondering whether this movement has been given timidity by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this changed so much with the sort of one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but in more than ... than the than they might have been a generation ago whether this uh played into its it's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investments and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise being had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently sued troubled by the time and when you look at ... ideology that doesn't necessarily safe to use it you should be what you do have women complaining for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of the mouths of domes famous\nNow the domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... ... for several decades it in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but\nBut there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grievance of these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home Fincher are just hard for me to say thank you very much to Patricia ... view company this morning and thank you for listening to this edition of weekend back at the same time tomorrow then they just international news is next here on the BBC will soon [noise]\n[noise]\nThe b._b._c.

yeah what do you think learning is feels like\nFeels like it I like a deep deep I\nWe've been ... well I think the opposite of loneliness and you know what would you say\nEverybody titan is happiness happiness the proceeds I've learned their lessons happiness\nKing you're listening to house check from the BBC with me Cody\nJulia Hammond today we're discussing the results of our study the b._b._c. lending us experiments and professor of mine way liberate to one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me now we've jak these he seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see that in a study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your own today\nNo no uh we had a sort of participants believing that line and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I was surprised to see the full ... percent of the people who responded told us they think that learning is can sometimes be positive that seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\nHas so much is a little bit like a social first let's say so when you're very very thirsty it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason is there to tell you you need to drink your buddies is aching for that drink\n'em and you do it and it's gone I'm learning is is a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening and what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by redirecting your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative uninfected can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where are they you don't pay attention to those signs or you count because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no ... no sufficient mobility no sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a global Saudi and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning is\nWell the short answer is yes we did find learning us in every country and in every age group all over the world\nIn terms of age we can also say that the age trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steeper so there was a bigger reduction in in ... uh\nAcross the lifespan than in others but at the trend is always they are but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of loneliness will almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to adults him a taste Lucas and from the open university who hails from New Zealand I thought his mental health\nTo me is eight and ... mental health and young people this\nIsn't the first time that um this is being highlighted statistics museum and talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loading us all of the time most of the time and it was around ... percent and then you see ... population based on the ceiling quality of life say bye\nAnd that compares to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six to St up people so it's interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again\nWhy do you think that that might be slightly levels of letting us and you say that because they don't say never had any it's just the levels are a bit later\nI had a few theories one might be around the composition of the coaches and use the ... about a third of people come from ... um coaches in particular minority coaches that the indigenous population and use the land\nAnd I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the click of his coach is on the majority and use the European coach I\nAm in terms of connection and the importance of of working together and supporting each other and now there is there's maybe around at the proportion of one person households UCLA has a slightly lower right to that than the u._k.\nMaybe it's also to be with activities that John groups such as sports participation which these you know what I'm doing well and\nAnd maybe it's the climate most of the population will be in the up and with on and which means that they aren't really hit the extremes and temperatures so these are going to be warmer summers and mild winters and most people close to the coast so they could be some sort of relationship around\nBeing out in about an engaging with the beach and spending time outdoors which is more difficult in countries when they were going to be quite harsh winters\nOr where they are really hot summers animal periods where it's difficult to be outside because extremes in the ...\nAnd they marched explain and the connections that people can create more easily\nCaught instinctive study looking perhaps comparing the north and south Ogden museum because of course and then all of a challenge from grad oranges and lemon and and that the climate spokeswoman than it is in the south islands that be interesting to see if that was a difference when it came to learning it\nYeah yeah and also in terms of rural communities and but then I think that rule communities in in Britain and elsewhere in the ... also have the ... the grace of connections and in closeness with knives\nAnd there was that one way flipped at people living in generally independent couches wet people are more reliance on themselves and proud of being without telling themselves ...\nCompared with the interdependent cultures within a more collective as to people rely more family and friends one of the things we found\nIs that um people in the independent cultures\nValue that romantic relationship small they make more of a difference whether they feel less ... than they do in the ants dependent couches let people may have family in a white family to rely on as well not this just one person that we might do it I was wondering what you would say in in New Zealand that ... what would you how much they

presidential election to end bad trade deals President Trump said this was the most important one the United states as as a maid so is it that good and does it vindicate his aggressive approach to trade his on economics correspondent Andrew woke up\nThis certainly looks like an important achievement in political terms before he took office President Trump was deeply critical of the arrests\nThe original North American free trade agreement calling it the worst trade deal the U.S had ever had\nRenegotiating it or even withdrawing from it was high on his agenda when he moved into the White House and now he has something to show for the F it just a few weeks ahead of the congressional mid term elections politically that can only be helpful for him and the Republican Party\nIs also the case of the new agreement includes some specific provisions that Mr Trump really wanted the rules on cars what's needed for them to qualify for duty free treatment to the U.S border on an important

will raise the price of college for the American motorists though it may not be obvious to prospective buyers and the show them that they are paying more or exactly why\nThere's a wider question to underline President Trump's assertive approach to trade is a preoccupation with the deficit and us international trade the country ... from abroad than it sells to foreigners\nIt was a theme he returned to repeatedly when he sat out the new agreement with Canada and Mexico to the media the United states and its trade deals he said has lost on average almost eight hundred billion dollars a year\nThat's the deficits don't trading goods and he wants to get it down or preferably eliminated\nThe trouble is that most economists don't think that trade balances whether a country has its surface or deficit are determined by trade policy most will tell you it's about spending and saving a country which spends more than ... and we'll have a deficit\nThere is something else that President Trump is doing that he doesn't appear to think a link to trade policy tax cuts\nIn fact one way of country can spend more and save last is the government has a deficit in his eye and finance is now the economic relationships are very complex but it's certainly possible that lower taxes and increased government borrowing could mean a bigger trade deficit\n... main a bigger trade deficit they would be very premature to come to any conclusions about whether Donald Trump has been good or bad for the U.S trade deficit and there is another debate to be had about whether the deficit mass is very much into\nWhat we can say is it is bigger than when he took office that is what the data shows that could only aggravate his view of the U.S as a victim of bad trade deals in by trading
