plenty of material and when it comes to making a seat for which you and looking into it yeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exists but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where did they go with their fired because they're pregnant so we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of Harvey Weinstein in the allegations that came out about him did that present personal dynamics fee you about whether to speak house who knows\nI've never had too many difficulties speaking out what was important for me me too was the survivors\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed\nThe time's up movement is now what are we going to do about it\nLike having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power but right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a\nA wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you are talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about ... cat but haven't spoken to them\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because this was before it became public that Rosanna told me her experience and\nThe experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't override her and speak do\nYou think that the whole controversy around Brett Kavanaugh and his appointment as the Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford herself was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a me too movement in fact African American women have been coming forward and speaking\nAbout this long before white famous white women in Hollywood have been doing so but I think the behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd how they were too scared to question her blessing for directly for fear of appearing away Joe Biden and others who questioned during the Clarence Thomas hearings so they hired a woman lawyer to do it you know that's a cop out we're cowards\nThat is because of me too they knew they had\n... lawyer to do it you know that's a cop out right cowards that is because of me too they knew they had to be a very very careful\nAnd so they were careful for a while and then of course Trump insulted her and ... her and then people followed suit and what ensued after her when Kavanaugh himself testified was just a horrific spectacle\nJane Fonda in London to launch the British

large degree by the communists allow that\nVery recently I was surprised people were banned from having long beards and and for my Islamic traditional dress but that's all changed\nAs well it really does because the ... the motivations for those that banning we're still communist and that religion was seen as a threat\nOr budge you now have is of an an allowance and increase the freedom of religion but with the threat of being imported into those countries from abroad the extremist threats so how do they allow freedom of religion without\nA lie loose and freedom of extremism that's the

ominous development when you get threats to democracy will very many people in your ...\nFor the people that live in democratic society so I think it's an ominous development when you get threats democracy well\nVery many people in your native United States like the fact that democracy helped elect President Trump and they think that he's fighting neck outta\nWell actually what we're talking about his liberal democracy\nSo the democracy park refers to people voting but the liberal part refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and balances that make sure that\nWhat the people choose doesn't Sharon eyes over their fellow citizens doesn't excessively concentrate power and that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of the populace politician like Donald Trump\nI'll hang on democracy is only a good thing when people vote in a way that you to prove\n[laughter] no I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law you know people can make lots of choices but their choices cannot uh include for example the\nDepriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals of their uh equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us what\nLinked D.C between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized\nAnd that's why we go into politics because we want political recognition that\nA dignity we want the society to acknowledge that we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender the ethnicity the race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that's propelled a lot of\nPolitics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't do\nYes I did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean the descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that\nPeople that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of that National Community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know what I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book and like the alternatives to Germany movement that you will send mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day night has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and got all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people or you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions collectively\n... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say her you know not for me and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that's democracy if black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt uh is Fox or see an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se it's going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's Robert Mueller and his investigation over the connection\nBy basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and if the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and I think that if he\nGets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts medium dependence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity that demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics to black yes\nIt's really interesting isn't it because they talk about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut what we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other in the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons\nIn terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it\nAnd therefore won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes\nWhich then become uncomfortable and we moved to the middle so that ... that comes from Brian in motion\nEffectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is it's a multi faceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue here is is really I'm very profound and I think France is so key albums ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more widely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to do any ... ...\nAs being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way forward we are not going to go any ... ... ... it's not going to go away without even though it's so new indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it to the manager who fashion\nThe tension that's who spoke about essentially the tension between uh the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says\nA ordinary people decide what they want now the value system a it is possible the system from which the ordinary people are often divorced\nOrdinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most is that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the ... and it is these these people that are hardest by extremists politicians who are anti democratic in the longer term\nSo we do have a a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and ... but in a democratic system otherwise it's very fragile\nOne problem assume we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of people up you know there isn't a passion surrounding the airlines have liberal democracies up right now there is um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being a safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ...

doing that so I'm of course it doesn't tell us that uh the [noise] that can never be some limits on our lifespan it might happen in future that the cub will altering but what we can say is that hasn't happened yet there were no signs of it happening yet\nUm why should that be a limit if you can find ways in the future of preventing cells from becoming cancerous and you can find ways of preventing dementia and you can find ways of replacing bones and grabbing new bones if necessary why why shouldn't we just carry on getting older and older\nWell it's quite speculative but some people have proposed that that might be some kind of natural physical limits on old buddy for instance maybe I'll bones just a destined to crumble after a certain age or maybe the right to which uh we can replace nice cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but\nFrom all after such an age old may be the right to which we can replace me cells just can't keep up with that than dying um but I Would say

about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they remove but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that that's\nA very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove common names there why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about

fine nice\nPeople want to build near coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the gains are making so\nThe big tech not really

Fernando ... died in the second round of the presidential election it's being attempt pasture his campaign and the key weapon has been the messaging service ... fat\nA BBC investigation uncovered how political campaign has have you software that scrapes Facebook for citizens from numbers and then ultimately sends them walk ... messages and asked them to ... groups\nJudy underground Yani from BBC News Brazil told me about this investigation and explained to just how important ... sap has become in Brazil\nOf is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use what's up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million\nIt has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the interest\n... says is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so\nIt's it's a cheap and readily available to and how easy being abused during the present interactions\nSo we found out that there are campaigns that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can just send the message is individually about a candidate or when they put people in lots of groups one market here who I spoke to was\nTold me he would put a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be to ah people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is\nJust a little fringe activity or is it an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties and it was up has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part\nUh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use lots up in Brazil\nAnd uh the far right candidate presidential candidate for NATO\nOr who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook said and Facebook told us it is investigating a the claims\nA it is also against a lots of rules and watts of has been a trying to shut down spam accounts what they say they said that they have closed thousands of Spanish accounts in Brazil\nAnd the justice system in Brazil or doesn't let a clear if it's a against the law or not it hasn't a written laws thinking about watts up this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil\nOr disagree between what is it legal and what is not they can only say that illegal databases\nThis in Brazil or disagree between what is it legal and what is not we can only say that illegal databases being used to get people's phone numbers that is legal\nThat's Judy on our ground you're only from BBC News Brazil or to ... a special gift um it's it's two years ago that we began I suppose to worry about the impact of social media on elections with the U.S presidential elections\nUm and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course it works out just keeps on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell some of us will be learning about these kinds of things are moving the is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I think it is and it was and to do the same problem which is how our politicians today going to get their messages across to people on campaign the way the wheels socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media\n... the politicians are going to do that and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data Halladay targeting people the messages\nAre I think things have ... ... but he's having that conversations if you were a political candidate he would also trying to do that now in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nOr to put it kindly to the these are always the question if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and why am I being added to this I\nThink I'd be annoyed but I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of how ... put across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus\nOn we've seen more ovens this week the vice was not cutting well for instance in fake news being used as a political weapon in the United states more examples of during this ah whole saga about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole model is\nEverybody shares it everybody else we don't control the content and so if that sets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem is an easy answer that you can say this should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I didn't answer as well\nWell then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I didn't want answers\n[noise] well we're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on tax and then when we come back to thanks to my special guest ... thanks to my baby see technology colleague climate and you can read older that stories at BBC adult comb slashed technologies also video lots of stories\nPlenty plenty of information that and I forgot to join his again in the tent\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

she got a fellowship from the national institutes of health\nAnd the U.S because she's a U.S citizen and in doing so she saved my lab a huge amount of money but because her funding source was
