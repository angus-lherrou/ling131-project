points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago I was to say that the failure of the coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm the what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminist and found and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely set forward by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looks as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black\nSisters I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist rude it's time to ... back into survival mode ... dumpster fire and live by a bore\nFeminist agenda and\nAm I mean I could just laying people who actually\nUh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals\nUm who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike I'm so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women\nIs not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe Dr lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean that gender is significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same\nTime I know this grind is a problem I I ... I ... the ...\nThe argument that you could bring different groups of press people together to make common cause with them I can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments new powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull groups\nMany of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a multiracial and in fat and bipartisan\nSo um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences I think in fact uh the last a week opens up even more possibilities are everything that we've been seeing\nThings that just that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about Morocco by about because he's with the midterms coming up his return to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and oh gee beat the Americans not as well known since I said I go\nVote from every demographic do you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually Washington rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections who what where in election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning\nUh trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the cultural liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale whites with the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says\nThat again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships in attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I I don't I make the complexity even greater\nI'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones they gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore\nA when a U.S senator um who was the first a Democrat\nOr to be elected I'm from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women as the wheels on the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them as we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this midterm election will see\nWe will indeed seeking really Crenshaw thank you

that\nStation and the founder of tech start up a ... labs here on business daily from the BBC that there are two business responses to some of the online threat but how bad is it really on these concerns I have a date that just an occupational hazard of life on line or are they something deep and\nWe've created this crazy system where every time you use it you leave data about yourself and what's your activities are for anybody else to harvest\nBody else to harvest and that's just not right\nThat is Larry ... founding director of the California Institute for telecommunications in information technology and one of the architects of the first prototype networks the precursors to the ... Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure as I grow even original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and whether as many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nBut still people don't necessarily\nPanic about sold at someone else's harvesting the data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nOr they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness\nWell you're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period you haven't got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you\nYou may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants but\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential as Ken burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it\nOr to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have it\nSo the most simple level it is forcing Internet uses regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else\nEveryone knows is using rather than opting out is is now kind of ... being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the ah catastrophes that are happening on the net including the very attacks on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform a very small no of course he's argument isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrated by the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nThere is Anderson is the founder of scout AI it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the bolt for them and nippy electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Miller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent body but generally ...\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that there's a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent too\nIt with a deliberate intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further into harden and calcified their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior in specific ways\nIs extraordinary and we just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook of these platforms into a physical community we'd be standing in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world\nKind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is going to the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator out they were having a conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or pots or algorithms whatever they might be and they'll retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging\nThey'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire\nAnd then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook and those stories then become mainstream news right to that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect did\nBy a group of fake accounts on social media\nBecause you say the mainstream news meter was complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it has and you'll have not yet buried under ... who suggests a variety of own says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliable\nBut yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah I mean it would be in a decentralized attack you know trying to see if\nHe centralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we will go live with the Internet is not going to go away because on invented\nCan me I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets and dissident who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly it's not\nJust technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation and legal changes\nIt's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's
