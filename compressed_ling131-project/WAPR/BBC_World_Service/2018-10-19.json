English at Cambridge University welcome to the oil I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe planes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that has less to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice we can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that politics is really about individualized I didn't see individuals are small groups very often so cool minorities that's how I ... for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities and countries so there's a problem I think in that it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective\nIslam yeah sure among you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nTo me about the kind of white victim narratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying well we are the victims [noise] what was seen the ad is loss of privilege\nBeing coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that no loss of ... outrageous\nThough is that rather an important point Adrian ... does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic leads believing abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority or majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you have any ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims Israel oppression exploitation\nBy the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common bottom ... just to say I'm a victim because I happened to be ... ... what's that\nThat doesn't or to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognized as vets exactly in fact what\nThe tea movement did they said look this is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but that is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is what about ... about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bed movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't it problematic that vis round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck\nProtecting us has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden the invest debate the ride with saying\nWho has if you find somebody who was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and it was part of a left\nBut talking about food was problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of a disagreement about what to fight to be one because I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than we would have to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation says I needed a picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of and told her and\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along like ... we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same sheet about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we coached on politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call not allowed to\nBring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to come into ... well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards\nThink that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with people who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there's somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black\nOr ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're going to think twice about approaching them and not ugly or I didn't get life fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nMe might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful agents\nIt's intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on all pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the ... of course they're real differences out and that should be celebrated\nBut they also the commonalities that's how we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus in this shouldn't be one\nBut the memory simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that politics has become\nSo do I ... I I really would like Exxon pillows I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't bringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that would give and it was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples of what I Want to make the uh but I think a black lives matter in many ways as an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem with police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument but like I've met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and that this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true\nBut the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried\nSleep injustice but you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's white people get shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have\nNever lived in Mount a cultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions banking situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with essentially than to its by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier ...\nWell it started to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a more ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and thank God we've started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to make societies but that is something you talked to quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by its minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among ... and Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't handle UK or tweet me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a poll cost you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll to cost\nKay or tweet me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to just such a BBC the real story in your poll cost app\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

to communities incomes as much as we kind of feeling out of politics I only got like\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reason for

agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door of all\nIn some ways it was six if you'll never end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic um in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity\nIdea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClump sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups\nIt's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into small groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's it is in\nThe politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay I mean I'm\nVery bad at all I don't know I mean I think the question is that I think clearly humans to have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic group\nAnd the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen you look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim as far as tiles to make it

sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from

if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level\nWhich coincides with the actual ... cents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course and that you think should in between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nOn the ones that have foisted the of course we do and the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of\nPeople who have my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and other ... emphasize the ways in which discrimination against this group goes against
