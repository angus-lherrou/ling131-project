to tell us what information warfare looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nRight let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong\nOn the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these terms men's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist an anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentions et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nHow come I self as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat stuck to molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the revel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of evil and good and\nBalance when Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you seat never before has the star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... think prominent roles and fish and got some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them except for their behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThat were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know a number of years and the Russian\nThat would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know a number of years and the Russians ... I've been sort of themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt these states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer a tactic\nThat's the kind of idea just generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society to take the style was example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... on rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each one of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggle to take action\nAs Yoda says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nFrom a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism than ... video does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of\nConversations about the me too movement and so on the continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media round\nTend to see against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to video gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative it's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points you know the what if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only ... days in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one\nBut what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader pattern\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's disinformation\nCampaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda\nWell I'm going to let Josh the rushing troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be\nOn verified information or this viral retreating is very viral tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what you're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we've said before think twice before you share or retreat [noise]\nMarket

[noise] mainline is working to what she's going to find [noise] she opened the door to her land inside tens of thousands of one recurring around in different books [noise]\nShe she is into one [noise] then um [noise]\nThousands of one recurring around in different books [noise] she ... into one then another [noise] slowly dorms on her what she's seen could help children to benefit hazing condition known to us [noise]\nAging [noise]\nDiseases related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day\nBut a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way [noise] but for the past few years research to carry that remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life span\nBillions of dollars being spent all over the world in efforts to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what may wind discovered with one and one scientist stuff the aging process in ourselves\nAs we answer a question that own associate has probably yeah [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nPart one\nIt's all in the taste\nOf what\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history\n... witness cool Christians [noise] he looked at adults that so many years then one day decided he'd had enough of tracing ill people he now runs the Danish aging was set center well he's trying to stop people getting in the first place\n[noise]\nWe only with aging looks like from the outside what is actually due to a ...\nWell ... accumulation of damage from the molecular level the spread to the\nShells and a tissue and organs and to the whole organism make kind of all the hitch a that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStarch and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties this dot in the day so I'm such a seven so it it ... yeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter]\nSorry and there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nOh thanks for the good news [laughter] sorry\nAnd there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice is dangerous being forty to compare to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nDoes does the eyes of let tell my co author is I'm\nLiving together ways as Ashley all over our body from the digestive track inside our body to the skiing outside our body so that everywhere\nYou can't see it with the naked eye but um I ... it's all over an inside us most of it just made up of bacteria but it also contains funky viruses and other microbes to in the ... scientists haven't given it much tension but we now know it has a profound effect to not building\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how while away they have\nAnd all of a show how we respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play very important to keep a house the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three wakes felt that make them water for a modest puff subject yeah [noise]\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you will to do was micro biome would it live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside one gun tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the ones expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan\n[noise] a few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan\nI was so excited because when we find infield cases anymore not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ones live full about fifty percent longer fifty percent yet\nThat's extraordinary so you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool four and a half four and a half yes him was that much more than you would expect it\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kind of like gambling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know wait wait that ... way to test them but you never know whether your idea is ride around\nAnd do some moments where you find that rates out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different micro biome give one little Tony a longer life with a better quality of life in their final days\nSo they're way with the right way can look at how well they they have when they're older because worm when they're getting older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of coordinated\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly one [noise] and she's right you can tell their own wild younger woman's regal energetically around in the older ones moves loaning the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they show rank house but it can tell their body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new ... those are new wrinkle to ramble quickly and their old age\nBut they were less susceptible to disease to [noise] main one is now carrying out tests on mice to see where the changing them like ... extends then life and so there's a chance that one day doctors might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome of my colleagues say okay you know I think people can they've ... say ... years so personally I think why under for me is already the number [noise]\nSo how long can relive full [noise]\nWe've heard about ... to ... to pick it up to a hundred and stuff\nSo how long can we live full [noise]\nWe've heard about all the ... that could get a to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions er about the dressing the symptoms\nOf aging the coal [noise] well then if we could go straight to the store [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHeart for\nFighting you're so I Do [noise]\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that's low in a hurry professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter\nIn the u._k. and scientists use was on aging as 'cause a lot of people like scientists\nBefore now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI work all begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues tomato different types of cells now cells get told that some cells and say your liver kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ... and\nSometimes it comes from the lesson would send a scary which means to grow old and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence ... will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like self thing I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... does well\nWow so it so much sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around as ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a self becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\n[laughter]\nDo they make the cells around them HPV often these innocent cells still functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\n... wants to know whether she could get these sites\nAnd like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\nHigh rates wants to know whether she could get these cells still behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nWhat happened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was still finding ... seats and we have some old files and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still looked like ... so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular die that we can put on a cell coaches at times blue if that's an excellent\nSo when I was expecting to see is that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she ... they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like themselves to professor Harry said you've got the wrong cells these are young sales go through it again and that and she did\nAnd she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to\nBasically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's bad that it's probably ...\nHow many rogue city search uh probably about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're on to somebody had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenate you don't sound tenements young south\nAnd they said why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the world is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the ... too much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan sink low in a hurry it's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough ... maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up and he's a new generation of empty degenerative drugs we stood away off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that\nThis will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people who would have died at age will then go on to live than not loaded lifespan so how long can we live\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song from what we cut at stake I it's like to write [noise] with the discoveries of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be\nTouch that stick out it's like to write [noise]\n\nWith the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged ...\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying it still costs sounds aging how many years could all the saddle\nWhen if we go by Tahir bell mixed prediction if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy

being able to localized in Saudi Arabia and that's the remains to be seen whether those investments will be localized and whether it will contribute to the Saudi economy and just have employment\nIn any real or effective way\nIn which case how seriously can retake this reform procedures in terms of the country's domestic arrangements have there been any clues at the conference itself this week\nThe absences are without a doubt noticeable and prominent\nBut the question is really whether that will result in business being withdrawn from\nThe region and that's not something that we're seeing we're still seeing lower level executives attending the conference I say you know they want to be in Saudi but the image is still important and that's why the executives are not present\nExactly we had Japan's softbank I think was one delegation where they went to Saudi Arabia they shouldn't go to the main calling for it so I said from another Australian outfit has done something similar\nAnd much more prominent if Russia and Asia and the majority of the featured deals with Asian companies the mostly in the oil and gas and transportation factor for of technology conference I mean obviously those areas involve a lot of technology but it's not the kind of\nTechnology focus companies that we saw featured prominently last year\nOne thing that surprising to me is the reports that the conference is still packed out I mean despite all the absolute too you know there are many of them that they still managed to kind of it's standing room only isn't it by the sounds of it\nIn certain sections there definitely been standing room only there's definitely a very heavy presence of Gulf area individuals\nSo essentially if the Americans or Europeans were staying away it's pretty easy to find other to step into that that place\nIs definitely a recognition that there's a lot of money that the Saudi Government is still interested in putting into their not stopping this diversification plan they're still going forward with it there's still a desire for foreign businesses to come in\nInterested in putting into their not stopping this diversification plan they're stuck on solid with it is still a desire for foreign businesses to come in and participate in the growing shouting autonomy\nI Believe my I had been some and in his speech to the conference this week praise for example the head of the French oil group type ... being one of those who agreed still to attend despite the controversy\nThat he suggested that loyalty by foreign trading partners like this would be rewarded there is a clear push back against the boycott from others\nThat's typical of what Saudi tradition this idea of ... at a but at the same time ... ventures in setting you

we're always going to go forward with nothing ramps how\nAre you anticipating a change of direction from Saudi Arabia how will this play out in terms of policy irrespective of the leaders\nIn general I think that they are committed to their economic diversification plan I don't think that would increase any other types of reforms the main focus is really on improving the economy improving employment through major investments from the government at the very top down\nApproach and I don't see them changing that anytime soon\nNonetheless do you think this week it's been a shock\nYes I don't think anything will change but I Do think it has been a shock\nAnd in a walled president of trends vessel consulting here on business daily from the BBC well away from the questions of oil and

don't want to lose in order like that and you know there are other ways of a Harley Shaiken to use the word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true\nSo what does the over all state of West and arms

as well but Denver and we have another special reports on America's opioid crisis on friday I spoke to keep them preserve drunk policy expert at Stanford University what could politicians on this a new legislation white has\nJust said drugs crisis in the U. S. gathered such momentum\nWe have three waves of it ... it starts due to poor regulation of pharmaceutical companies could make opioids which led to quadrupling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for about Fifteen Years\nAnd that brought us to level like about six times per capita of what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they opened up shop in a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase\nAnd then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration of heroin supply with fentanyl\nFace and then most recently in the last five years or so has been the infiltration\nOf heroin supply with fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid far more potent than heroin and that has turned a disaster into a catastrophe you know upper scale we haven't seen and drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nSentinel is an entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab or you can make it in your sink\nTherefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry and a large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet they've been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver a it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver fentanyl Bennett's blended into the heroin which is very appealing to a heroin tracker because now you have a drug you can make justice strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that has been in Port in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to cut the ... ... one of the main at 'em and solve that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sense of ... policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nAh reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addiction having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nOf supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're extremely high risk of overdose and so there's going to be demonstration projects where they'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that\nTogether I think will lead up to saving some lives even though if there's not a transformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in\nThere's not a transformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcomes that ad or\nBeing addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their family so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words we're providing health care properly it's not just a matter of people who are already addicted surviving we should stop creating as many addicted people as we have in prior years\nThat but to keep him preserve drug policy expert at Stanford University in the United states who's a what with the American politicians in drafting\nA the the new legislation to combat the I.
