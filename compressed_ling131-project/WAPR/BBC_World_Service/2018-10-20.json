S. midterms approach to look at the identity politics have left and right and their impact on democracy\nOn a panel this week in the studio with me here Adrian ... professor of politics the University of Kent\nNine or ... novelist and journalist\nYes among lecture on government at Harvard University and in Cambridge be involved a ... a lecturer in English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nPolitics is I think to ... that has been given and is used to describe\nMean by it Priya identity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe claims for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to them on to equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that has less to do with the identity of a sudden than with questions of justice we can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian\nPast what does it mean to you that politics is really about individualized identity individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that's how rocky arguing for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevated of a coma novelty that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in that it's a response individual lives and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collect ...\n... you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nNarratives that line or just a minute as to whether the majority is now saying we are the victims what we're seeing the air is loss of privilege being coded as oppression and that's a real difference between actually being oppressed and actually feeling that your loss of privilege as outrageous\nOh is that rather an important point Adrian how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged\nBeing oppressed and actually feeling that your last ... outrageous though is that rather an important point stage and how does it simply that the majority of finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nBut I think the problem is that you have\nOn the one hand very technocratic leads believing in very abstract things that didn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people in the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy it's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you are black or white or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims they Israel oppression exploitation\nBy the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happened to be ... or is that\nThat doesn't ask to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering you'll repression was an offense against humanity many people would just simply not recognized but that's exactly in\nFact what the other beauty movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will just aside would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white American goal and sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells the mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride with saying\nWho cats if you find somebody who he was enough of a different race we should celebrate that and it was possible left the time of food that was probably ... ... for me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one because I went to society\nIt was part of a left but somehow forfeit was problematic size leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures Robin where everybody is to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those I needed a picture and in a movie of interracial relationships is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression\nAnd structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we talked on politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleventh for you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful news on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity\nAnd ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is a someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani\nBut you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word\nYou might express something that's a little you know not\nAnd they get to ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying\nAnd they make people socially fearful Adrian\nIt's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together somehow to differences defined as more than the chronology of course they're real differences out to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out and she's a real we all citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus and they shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think ... bench politics has become\nSo the ... I I really would like example is I mean I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and lack of commonality and differences\nBut I'm not hearing an example the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nIt's just let me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make clear but I think a black lives matter in many ways as an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the this is a huge scandal not when you look at the numbers is also true that\nThe majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry ... off the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and visit particularly deep injustice\nBut you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually there's\nWhite people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in Mount a cultural multi religious monolingual states\nThis is new new situation\nPeople have never lived in Mount a cultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee and along the function physical policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and Ken situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized nothing's a problem with essentially than Tuesday's fight definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier ...\nWell that's not to disagree with premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a more ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and find God we've started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies but that is something you talked to quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by its minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering okay\nPledged to think about that thank you for ... panel\nBanned by the Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian ... we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas but topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't handle UK or treat me ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your pocket cost up\nOf the BBC will servicing us has made possible by American public media with support from fidelity investments sticking your personal loss approach to helping clients group preserving vantage there will learn more about what he dot com slash wealth to do with the brokerage services or else\nIf pressed their ... because they're working ... not because they're white there was no evidence to tell us that the white working class it was out doing disproportionately badly as compared to let us say the Latino all ... which\nIs an interesting and important point I wanted to bring it back to specific 'cause if I may if we look back Adrian at the recent German state elections in Bavaria what happened that this is a last weekend you saw a traditional policy to conserve to CSP which has dominated politics in that part of Germany for decades\nFound itself hemorrhaging votes were still at the end of the biggest policy but a much smaller but a policy than it had been hemorrhage face the greens on one side and to the anti immigrant asked the on the other meanwhile the S. P. D. which is the leftist sent about ... ...\nIt seems that those his entourage choosing policies which have\nClear a narrow agendas ones which can they can identify with say they if the anti immigrant uh you know I'm a lifetime working class I'm Jim and I do feel happy and his biggest space people pushing themselves into those\nWell I think now because the mainstream parties on offering something that's inclusive been off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with ... of course to working ... simply watching a lot of other components of the of the working class have suffered an often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people have suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know we'll rebelled against the status quo and and who reached to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much as last semester father does not like I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying the idea that somehow\nWe can just say we only ever look at the most depressed people into the only ones that my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the watch approaching and built in a rational utility maximizing preaches we ... we had people embedded in relationships institution\nFeelings is is it's not the wise approach in Wilson a rational utility maximizing preaches we all people who are involved each we're people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane cycle longing and I'm going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that followed from that has been loaning so who onto wet\nAnd ease parts of the reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that actually that that identity that with that fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the UP on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place and and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tried then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you said they shrill voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you\nA pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it winds bodes\nWell one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry I'm confused\nNaturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry Ken I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem\nBut I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the\nLarger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's it is in politics happens because those tribes are bad\nBut although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't know I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who as close to them as possible so that starts off with the family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious and ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly\nPowerful force and so now it seems to me for the best response is to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make it inclusive to say that either hire\nA collective uh it is a level of the kingdom of ... states but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity but how do you make that journey from being a cause in public and a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\n... I think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country or wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo the other hand over all the things that he's saying that you love found that it isn't that are going to told what's wrong and loving your country and its P. Portland is accused of other people of identity politics but I'm saying you're not\nHow do you enjoy it isn't out of\nControl what's wrong and loving your country and its P.\nPortland is accused of other people of identity politics but I'm saying that you're not just because your liver you opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you know I guess I'm going to your your national making my country but the majority of of\nOf Hindu majority and lets them so I look at nationalism\nThat's something that had served the stuff that's in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the writer response will be the ... for it is the or the national Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respective\nAll night and I believe that he is not true and it's not as though the older a form of nationalism and the Congress talk he didn't have an ... elements to it the one hand that we do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what\nAge it if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good thing\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan is and they all spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think at the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that if everybody identify primarily with the national ...\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we've had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course and that you often should in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly\nDo in the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time\nThe ones that have foisted upon mostly do and the people like ... like a mountain dew for king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I fight for the cause of\nPeople who share my identity is to emphasize outcome and interest as Americans and I didn't and emphasized for ways in which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above the level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common\n... that's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national it's something that led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down\nOr two billion people are posting things on faith [noise]\nWho decides what we can see [noise] and what we can\nI have to protect you from either side of humankind\nThat someone ex radiolab\nRadiolab Saturday at three PM when a PR this is\nAlabama public radio service of the University of Alabama W.

lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it to open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know other said they never thought they'd be something like this and the lifetime so when the door open to attend in the morning first customers walking you know big cheer corrupted and throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization ... Canada\nCanada goose is only the second country over to Europe why to to legalize cannabis fly legalized why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this you strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce that some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer and possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in ...\nYou are will be able to purchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form\nAnd you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he sign some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous province you can use it essentially the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly\nWhat it looks like now that is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams there are actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison\nNow of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health\nA society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there is a growing body of evidence that there was a risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush up on the possible boon to the economy that this development could have what are people thinking about that in the\nMonths up to legalization here in Canada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Kennedy statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an and twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spend rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely\n... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously Canada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course\nBig step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries are looking at decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other

founder and chief executive Kenny you and I'm often what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people who don't have those other ways of communicating with each other or so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease or so we farm or we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free or ... content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS this does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple on the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty ... it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple format\nOr so when a former asked this question uh for example on on SMS\nWe don't use machine learning and any I to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis too much them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and getting up his book content back to the original farmer\nNow you you go to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member ... what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people\n[noise] yeah so it would pass a million which is obviously a great milestone for us heading to one point to a million I'm I mean I think this the first in biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it\nOr even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so uh by twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know to put in context as is probably knew your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month or which gives you an indication of the level of content\nThat we find is necessarily a fun system to you is is not a social system its value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so\nI think that's probably the primary indicator that would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits they're seeing from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's helping save their their livelihoods and farms three we farm it was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example I I Would get his\nUm you know literally information it's helping save or their livelihoods and farms through before it was an example of how it's been years\nOr so I mean the example I gave is a there's a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called capital he kept on the in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods you know paid for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a disease was ... it has killed you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farm and go get information back\nA which vaccines to you is how to I just thought the disease spreading a managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihood and that's that's the kind of vital you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers but we found is able to to to provide\nA Kennedy you in from we from a Mona El sol from ... in a special guest uh\nUh that wasn't one of those red nail public a positive stories about social media or five years or so ago everyone the social media was going to save the world that was it was a positive uses we've all that changed totally\nYes to sound to live in was the year we celebrate in social media we thought it's going to the world it enables people and a three carry genes to move to towards democracy to mobilize masses\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like that\nYeah ... exactly will use social campaigns to reach people over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now are talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together still have many many many positive effects but\nOf course the perfect and that gets to highlight all the time\nA commercially it's still very important um I I Know these these connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we are getting more good than bad from it\nWe're still getting good but we're getting back now and locked seven maybe seven years ago I Would have failed because we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's ...\nBut now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated and make sure it's it's under control maybe went down no\nOne very brief from use every Kleiman are you still positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think there's a lot of gates that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's we've got time for anything on the positive thanks to my special guest Mona El soften the opposite ends of the Institute thanks does every climbing read over the stories in mind that BBC don't come flashed technology\nAnd I forgot to join us again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

maintaining critical infrastructure is a bit of a theme this week health is critical to ... society that into depends on access to effective antibiotics to treat infection\nRipple from the bureau of investigative journalism says that these critical infrastructure is being undermined by ones and use of antibiotics in livestock in India\nNow it's not entirely new antibiotics have been used in farming since they were available not just to kill disease but also to promote growth health experts have long booms that this large scale use move comes they use on farms\nNot just a cure disease but also to promote growth\nBut health experts have long goons at this large scale use most homes they use on farms in Phoenix is generating resistant bacteria\nThe practice is banned in Europe and since

let's call it in the last episode on your body is that can be used\nBut I have to say it's a law that problem can be like a global level and yet could make the under Bush and\nClinton is a real cause for concern it's an in replaceable antibiotic which is already being on the mind because of spreading resistance to most of the university is an expert in detecting the development and spread of new resistance mechanisms in bacteria\nOnce they get resistance mechanisms they become very difficult to treat and we're left with a few clinical treatment options wonderfully cheese Clifton ... either very few\nAnd they become very difficult to treat and we're left with a few clinical treatment options wonderfully cheese can list and quite frankly there are very few options clinically we have left and so it's extremely precious resource quite frankly technically speaking so to be using it on farms is just quite frankly\nBones because of course we'll start seeing animals need not be a human problem if it stays on the phone calls farm animals end up in kitchens\nPeople are going to get a lot of the bacteria in the foot by the cooking the food they knew that I ... that bacteria but let me

use too much infections that we get it from the food\nFor the most there are the factors in India and other less developed countries that compounds the spread of anti microbial resistance I Am a\nIf a country has poor infrastructure if it has poor sanitation if it has a pool public health system which a lot of the countries in South Asia do including India\nThen once this resistance is kind of

resistance as pawns they got to normal Flora I'm sure that's impacting on what we poppy seed clinically in India although trying to get the facts on the evidence that have been due to rectify that is challenging\nBut once you have a broken system and the broken infrastructure it is extremely difficult to contain and the microbial resistance if you have a large proportion of the country that don't have toilets at least seven hundred million Indians don't have toilets\nThey're also very poor sanitation and find a dish and Pakistan as well\nAnd the majority of the population each for that thing goes\nThat's at least seven hundred million Indians don't have toilets they're also ... Pakistan as well\nAnd the majority of the population each with their fingers so you don't have to be a genius to work out that you have this continued recycling within the community between peoples normal Flora and contaminated food and how that might she might spread throughout communities\nAnd so trying to fix the infrastructure in those countries is a really good way of limiting and she might quibble resistance and dealing with sanitation is one of the key steps that we should look to to overcome global I Am on\nThe news headlines for up to ... ... in the right to campaign he's been waging in India for several years he's a key author of the so called tonight declaration which the Indian government signed up to\nAn aims to reduce the over the prescription of antibiotics to people he's now arguing strongly for regulations in farming as well\nYeah they didn't know it all the band go almost with a guy by another company as I breaking the law in India so it is a lot of constantly being asked to make a law that you can almost tell you what I got about ... currently in the in the south making such a law\nTo ban the go bomb or something you said just go in\nYou cannot buy all get for the bomb also you say that they face a billion yeah but I just start with the naked buying a new job and get body like lift in us going in a lot of thought I'd give August thought the human\nAnd that going this is actually getting seemingly you will stay in the industry that couldn't get back\nTo ... visit Abdul ... have an uphill struggle\nWe have had various discussions interactions with the Indian come before I'm too has tried to set up the ... declaration in two thousand and Thirteen [noise]\nYou know that would be given a big fan ... everybody was very excited about that and he's almost zero support from the Indian government and so it's very difficult to understand uh no it's actually how committed the Indian government or the Indian medical research council or to ... and to microbial resistance\nYou know this is two thousand in Nineteen and how many years have to go by before we find some international solution on de resolution to this current predicament you know it's crazy\nMicrobiologist to Walsh of Cardiff University and I was also talking to ...\nThis come predicament you know it's crazy\nMicrobiologist to Walsh of ... university and I was also talking to Abdul gets all of the Apollo ...
