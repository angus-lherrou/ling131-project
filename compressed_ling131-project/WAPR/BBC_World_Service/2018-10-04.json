been engineered by a dozen or so hacking groups with different code names however leads straight to the Russian government intelligence among the cyber attacks the British Government has listed already twenty Seventeen hacking of files of international athletes held by the world anti doping\n... agency and interference in the twenties sixteen us elections so does any of this the allegations or Britain stance on the allegations come as a surprise that's the question I ask moly McHugh who's an expert on information warfare with new media frontier\nI think there were a number of things that stood out but I think we're really interesting I Do think it's very interesting that there was this\nSort of packaging of the accusations laying out a lot of detail thing we know a Russian military hackers were involved in these doesn't hacker groups behind the these half dozen campaigns ah this is what it achieved\nIt's really important to be transparent on what we know and for a long time I think all of us the sort of sat on these details officially um but I think now this is clearly from the u._k. and initiative to come out and say hey Russia we know a lot more about what you're doing and we say we're pretty tired of it you really overstepped in the u._k.\nAnd you're going to start paying for it and here's like the first step toward that is putting out the information that we know\nAnd that's the thing really the ... the u._k. is coming out with all of this information that they haven't see actually we have really good information about what's going on we're going to come out in the open\nAnd said because for example the cyber attack on the Democratic national convention headquarters it's often been blamed on Russia that's not surprising but it's the first signed the

a at the top of our leadership\nI'm being clear and straightforward about what it is that Russia's doing to target the west um with these types of attacks and having um a foreign intelligence service

in that attack\nSo perhaps it's not quite as bad as as people fooled middle of the fifty million accounts is still not suitable for\nNumber I'm just wondering briefly ... this is the I guess the second biggest story where Facebook users\nFacebook users like myself are saying gosh can we trust face but to take care of our profile\n[noise] uh I was talking to a security analyst a uh a few months ago and he said\nBasically any computer company which has computers should expect to be hacked the secret is used to be able to detect the hacking as soon as possible and do something about it and at least Facebook here they reportage as the rules say within Seventy two hours of detecting this\nAnd so they seem to be doing the right thing at the moment I think Bruce speaking out of that you

China\nDoes that mean almost thirty percent of its total national debt to China now earlier I spoke to Caesar chi low a senior research fellow at the zombie Institute for policy analysis and research

way\nThere's quite a bit of unemployment and I'm just like the it's all space for zombie us to do some of this\nDo some of the things that purportedly are now being targeted for China to do so I think part of the reason for the backlash is because the perception is China will take corporate jobs China would take over the industry and just sort of thing\nThe benefits for ... to be specific is money China spending a lot of money in Zambia whether it's loaning the government money whether it's spending money on projects investing in projects or acquiring assets so\nI Would imagine the government will say well look China is spending a lot of money in this country that's what's in it for us\nYeah I think that's a fair comment and for many economists point of view that kind of be significantly

moving parts for the pet shop car which means\nWhich means they're ten times cheaper to maintain the cost of charging an electric vehicle is also\nTen times cheaper than the cost of fueling a federal car on a per mile bases and the last five hundred thousand miles as opposed to just a hundred and forty thousand miles for the federal ...\nWhen you're over and you drive a car a hundred thousand miles per year over five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half or three patrol car and then you take a driver out of the equation then the cost goes down further three or four times\nSo you combine that on demand\nAutonomous and electric and you get paid ten times decrease in the cost\nThese satellite powerful arguments you'll saying this is starting in twenty twenty on you know you say two three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't William we don't really decide on the revolution that you describe happening we do\nAnd if you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S was a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla

but it's huge ... not to mention the technological hurdles\nI've been in a ton of vehicle and a lot of these cars are ready and yes there are regulatory hurdles but that's another genus improving explanation in several countries are investing the regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that are already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road and it may take\nThese vehicles on the road and it may take a
