Australia's with saloon no two Leno to invite you to sit with the cool kids though a China and the United states for the two biggest economies in the world are you going to joke about a global trade with them\nI'm curious what missile I spoke to independent research and stuff and he had a dog as to what exactly needs reforming about the WTO\nThere's three main points so the first is they want to improve the efficiency ineffectiveness of monitoring system so you've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together it's really difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now\nAnd that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade to international investment state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nUm and the third thing and so they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute supplement system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started the summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members of all of them\nOver all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's it going to work\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today ... have ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feuding parties as look this is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and grits and insurance\nOf the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean not this diplomacy this state craft and this is stuff that Canada frankly is very good at\nRight in the European Union is very good at it the United states used to be very good at it under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement which he has recently done and he took that right to the wire\nGood at it but under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement which he has recently done and he took that right to the wire he pulled out of the

instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim\nChina similarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose anything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate one\nOf the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of ... they're looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different panels\nWell this is that so you got the United states and the one hand saying that you know we're going to withdraw if the WTO doesn't shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges\nRight who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... let me say\nSay what you like about Donald Trump by him wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many

S. and I asked him how he saw President Trump would react if he could who's his story\nI guess I Would say that the president if he makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know why does it kind of stopped and so I think you know Trump he was elected primarily\nA in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his promise to stop illegal so\nUh he has said that we should have a heart with immigration policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of showing or clearly plane desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line he's rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching sauce do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nThink a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when he was talking about [noise] you know unknown middle Easterners\nYou know we in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans or moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially Buddhist\nSociety and so a lot of suburban Americans who are moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true no\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still in about thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence\nFor even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general they are do not approve them so they don't want immigration policy to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant\nA senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump is also included said Democrats caravans tried to pin the blame as they were when the Democrats is is a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of almost possibly help them in the sense that it might motivate the base perhaps even encourage\nHispanic votes is to come out and vote for them\nThat's a great point I think\nDemocrats they don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration policy and we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and the economy and Trump's character a and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nReally this effort to split the country and I Trump in terms of this feeling that this is a democratic caravan when a these types of ... something happening for the last couple of decades has\nDaniel Lipman with the Politico a news site\nIt's called little coverage in this uh on the BBC Web sites a beast needs to come I'm including a video made by a correspondent highly ...

could determine our future relationship with the EU and make sure that we do not suffer the consequences that such a major described\nPlenty of all this is that the prime minister is being manipulated

going on inside your party\nBut I I think briefings using disgusting language like that just to be condemned to today I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party given the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now over breakfast it cannot possibly deliver a cut here in Britain deal\nBecause I think that in the next few weeks if the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have a vote in parliament which I actually believe it\nIt's a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal\nAnd I think when I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have to support surely up some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off\nSome members at least of the opposition Labour

individuals' making contributions okay so hang on a second that you're saying that he's actually\nRaised more money by saying he will not take any money from the corporate sector\nHe'll take money from people who worked for corporations but he won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate pacts got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help him win\nIs very compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that the only thing that can help them when does this reflect\nThan a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better O'Rourke and other candidates that accept small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turned people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just click and and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of ... boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn fats artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out the vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own\nIf he does when it was suddenly send the big message across to Washington\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently than anyone else has thought possible\nAnd I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is the million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google\nOn recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was on\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital expenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last\nCycle federal glucose his car he losing including to the opinion polls by on a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment ... do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls\nKen you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in any traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial\nTo the Republicans keeping them majority losing it but despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nIn\nEnsuring our forty minutes president Donald Trump [noise]\n[noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties they were old may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump after all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research in recent years just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential unplugged is somehow should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters\nAnd so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists or what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction and so if you cannot advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more of uh\nFirst move in that direction and so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day of the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race and all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close\nIf it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're gonna you're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table\nAnd so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next uh in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separate oil this also talks political advertising we've been discussing we'd do wait to see another sense of how much manipulation on

BBC's Tom Field and has been talking to use\nYou can say that's the ... which which said like when when you already\nJust click on Scott and depending on what's your mood\nAnd how do you ... just on to those questions so the first in your ear off to rate your mood now how how tense you feed it gets so you have to break here so like how\nDiscussed at your food right now how anxious your and once you're done with the questions that would be able to do and this is tell you that for you so it's a picture it it's a film of you washing your hair so you guys must host washing my own hands the way I

washing my hands a lot of times and you get these ... in between the ... come on the on the screen just to ensure like you're watching the video and how concentrate\nOn your yes it it Oscar you how many circles came up on the screen and that brings you really weren't paying attention and you were actually engaged and it shows exactly and then it asks you how you feel after you've watched yourself wash your hands and now how disgusted whole anxious you for your\nShow but also the same sort of questions to measure like is it better for watching video or was it was after watching with you\nOh you're washing your hands as much as you were before the trial or or do you think it's had some sort of lost effect\nIf I keep on watching videos of washing my own hands all the time ... my mind I was like okay that's it you're going to wash your hands on so I can see a little bit different it's like okay I don't need to wash my hands now that's it\n[noise] well I've been talking to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developing dissolve the brain training at ... who's findings to the period in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage than some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands\nAnd because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touched maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even lead their own house because they worry that anything they touch\nWill you know a contaminate them\nI'm wants treatments currently exist\nSo there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nThey asked psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm\nGoing wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way out in these people as you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination but eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually they're alright there's nothing wrong so it isn't effective\nAnd but eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually they're alright there's nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment as the selective serotonin ... uptake inhibitors these drugs\nThat are used also in the treatment of depression the ss our eyes drugs like Prozac but again I'm about forty percent of patients are don't don't really get a good response to treatment\nBut yours you maintain your brain training app is more effective what's the thinking behind well the thinking behind that\nWas the first of all also when you have to do the C B te therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies for that at the world society and Academy of medical sciences\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself so there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to reflect if you'd like on the behavior\nSo they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious so stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBD therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or\nUse a cloth twice so used to have to throw it away if I was wiping account to but now I realize that actually there's nothing nothing wrong with using it twice rinsing it out or\nWhen I touched been I don't need to rush away and wash my hands so what sort of has have you had with those using this some brain training so we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive\nSymptoms and they will reduce\nAnd there's some brain training camp so we have a certain measures of this kind of for chess a compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent\nSo that was a good reduction because they've only use the ... for one week stuff they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive abilities so they're not so rich it in their cognitive thinking anymore they not so they will they can sort of think more about goals that they want to achieve rather than these rituals in their obsessive thoughts\nThat was a professor Barbara Sahakian not one very lucky person is reported to one of the law just to have the luxury jak

un member states and that is willing to host a an and conduct\nAnd military a maritime exercises in joint drills so I think this is just a an opportune time where they've all parties have seen that there's a necessity to have some sort of confidence building exercises and measures and they're taking each other up of a up on that offer\nBut the countries involved um I have not given up that territorial claims you know the south China Sea\nNo they haven't so this is really I'm In a way it's it's putting that aside for now and that is a long term issue that that is not going to be solved in terms of deciding which features belong to whom\nI'm the hope is that at in the meantime at least these countries can come together learn from each other build some sort of trust a and make sure that if there's any sort of maritime emergency in the south China Sea they have a basis to worked with each other on it\nAnd is China's thinking that all these countries might come to look upon the United states is the common enemy\n[noise] um I think China I'm certainly worried about the position of the United states I'm In the south China Sea as one that is not going away as the one that will will continue to reinforce it bilateral multilateral relationships in that region\nUm but it is at the same time going to uh exercise it's its own efforts to try and build upon its own bilateral multilateral relationships there\nWe did we stand with some international jurisdiction international rulings on whoever owns walked in the south China Sea\nWe have no international ruling on who owns

we have international ruling of course as a result of the permanent court of arbitration finding in two thousand sixteen which are ruled on the nature of the features in the south China Sea and what type of maritime territory they had around them but they made no ruling whatsoever on the sovereignty of those features\nSo um it's still up for grabs is Bush was saying and whoever\nHangs on to want to have a a gets to keep\nWell um it's definitely going to be difficult to say that countries who occupy certain features at the moment will suddenly relinquish them I'm not by ah like I said that sovereignty feature at sovereignty issue is going to be an issue that these countries are are going to be working on a in a very long timeframe\nSo China or the United states do you do see the the potential\nFor more conflict and has occurred in the south China Sea before between the United states and China on um I mean the the near collision that we saw recently uh between a Chinese\nAnd American ship 'em was certainly worrying and and the United states that have been reports that have come out of the United states saying that um they will step up exercises\nUm in the south China Sea that is likely to aggravate China but I think it's important to note that that neither China nor the United states are looking for war looking for conflict in that region that is hugely destabilizing\nUm and that is exactly what these types of of exercises in simulations are for um which is why we see this type of re engagement this push to try and build that trust\nWas no in many
