X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encourage courage and by fracture\nSomeone else who seems dissuaded ... is President Trump he's routinely claim that millions of people voted illegally when he was elected two years ago\nHe's never offered any evidence for that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes cost to vote to registration forms\nThere's no actual or real verification by election officials once they get that for him to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nExample of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check\nThat's a problem and is the problem that many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nGive them a name and you get to vote and you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there isn't really a problem how do you respond to that while I respond to that by citing\nStirring up a specter for problem where there was really a problem how do you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\n... therapeutic in the southern states but not only in the southern states long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate patting the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them\nRequiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to press turn out\nThe number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the ... the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very small problem and\nThe ... the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very\nSmall problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county here or a county there\nWhere it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out ... you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the balls than have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating because of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box ... evidence you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been um numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas\nAnd Tennessee I think if you look at the intent of Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have helped him carry key swing states like Wisconsin uh for example I and\nI think it also it just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that fewer people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have\nThe state board of elections did a careful review and they found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to choose I almost Ari\nIf you look at the case the frog that weren't covered most of the time they weren't ex felons\nWho didn't realize they're an eligible to vote there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast the ballot because there was a very very steep price to pay when you're talking about potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines\nAll for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties for being [noise]\nMost of those ex felons didn't in the end face any further action bumped in elements county twelve people were prosecuted\nAnd they soon became known as the elements twelve\nMe could Rogers was one of them I'm for this program the dark sides of American democracy here on BBC World service she agreed to meet me she was setting up the bomb in Greensboro where she works Rene woman uh\nI was on probation so at that time I wasn't aware that it made me ineligible vote because no one that told me that at all on our breaking the law\nI Would not have you know made any moves to go vote I would've just\nNot had my ...\nTell me what happened off ...\nWell after the election I'm guessing it passed and after I got off work one day I came\nHome to a note on my door thing that I had a long way from Iraq so\nThe Adams County sheriff's department and they inform me that I had a warrant for felonies voting\nAnd the lady kind of a shock when I talk to on the phone\nHow your cases for the bigger picture which is about thirty to fool with some people who look as you say you were trying to sway the electro fish to what you say to them\nI don't think ending twenty four months of my life away from my home my job I my kids is worth me voting you know again if I Would have known that I was not able to vote I Would not have broken the law and decided to vote anyway not blatantly\nNow this is an election coming up in November\nWhat's your situation now you take misleading\nAdded to vote anyway not blatantly\nNow this is an election coming up in November\nWhat's your situation now you've taken is the deal are you on probation now\nNow I Am actually off of the nation free clean and clear no travel you know all of that behind me you know what I mean though and it was the highly

you know they say we didn't know we were in breach of the little the state board in the files you the kind of covering left to sedate acknowledged that some of the paperwork it'd be very confusing I

great ... for being with us on Newsday some might say that it's taken the Americans too long to say that they could have\nPut pressure on for a ceasefire ages ago\n[noise] yes uh I I think that's right and I think from our perspective or there's a lot of that could have been done a lot for a call for this cease fire but the ceasefire is a significant breakthrough in this war and I walk a recognition that the current policy is failing and\nIt's a recognition that there is no military solution to the end of the board and then there's only a diplomatic solution and\nUrging people to get around the table and negotiate for peace as what absolutely needs to happen and a ceasefire absolutely needs to happen so that humanitarian aid can be delivered to the people and the men who are suffering and that is the innocent civilians twenty two million people in need of humanitarian aid with more than fifty percent of health care facilities destroyed\nAnd I think at the same time the U.S and the u._k. are supporters to the Saudi led coalition and the wind and then and so I think that there's more that can add to bring an end to this war\nJean Louis in this this leverage from from Jim ... will actually lead\nLed coalition and the war in Yemen and so I think that there's more that can be done to bring an end to this war\nAnd she joined us in this this leverage from from Jim ... will actually lead to something to think what he said he gives hope for them to not forcing\n[noise] I think it gives hope I think that as a a major supporter to the Saudi led coalition and into the war in Yemen that the u._s. calling out for a ceasefire is a significant breakthrough and I think it's it's the first time we've seen this\nOr something like this in a in a number of years and it does give us hope that this could bring about an end to the war um but at the same time there is more that the U.S and the u._k. should be doing\n... um you know as military suppliers to the Saudi led coalition a they have significant leverage 'em\nOver Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates who are involved in the war um and supporting the mind Griffin has said you know play for to bring the sides together and have peace talks is is definitely something that the U.S and you should be doing\nA little I guess we heard President Trump talked about how important selling weapons to Saudi

ecology and I take care I think babies that are in the ICU and after they were born in the media now I [noise]\nWhen babies born addicted that is a common misnomer that addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it they're babies or not\nAddicted that is a common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple\nFacets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies there incidents that\nWere exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure if long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that substance once they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided\nThey become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debate so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI system so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have\nRespiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney a which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing those babies are in control of oil and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick\nBabies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but the little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime they sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think\nAbout our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely\nImportant part of\nPopulation change in the United states in that era\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing\nSector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThan the situation is quite different and it creates a new class stratification that entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you\nThink about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger a global\nThink about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... son um editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S. curbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American narrative that is the panelists immigrant\nWho arrived to seek a new life on through hard work determination goes on to prosper and thrive so would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration\nAfter all the United states is often described\nAs homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd image grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that it's been a dream for white immigrants it's extreme that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than\nGrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHas applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them\nBut there is not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean at theories in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there have even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it statistically those populations have been permanently marginal\nI'm clear that your own a different and the political spectrum to run the salon the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his ... that in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to changing economy will needed\nIs a cook on immigration

get to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for all of the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who are providing those services\nProfessor of these uh Chomsky at
