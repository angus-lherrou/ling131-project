this some genetic connections\nWell the um the lore and the field has been that sperm package their DNA very differently that they get rid of\nThe ... the typical form of DNA packaging with which has

called ... it's tiny\nDo not carry at the genetic memory what we showed in\nWorms firms that we're using a little model organism called ... tiny worm we showed that their sperm retain histone packaging of all of the sperm genome the Malian sperm just retain some packaging systems\nAnd then we further showed that the histone packaging is really important that that uh his don't packaging includes important at the genetic markers and that if we remove those at the genetic markers from the sperm packaging that that has an influence on offspring\nActually an Austrian fertility causes the

continued reliance recalling him is on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind believed that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it would be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss\nUsed his

perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem with the hearts of economics

work\nIsn't going to go the way of frogs where employees now the legal right to avoid with emails outside working hours it's a question I put to Ellen temperature and she's a partner at the little from Louis silken here in London where she covers employment low and workplace privacy\nI don't know what the rationale for the French legislation was I think from the u._k. perspective the concern would be around the idea that you never switch off\nAnd the other reason why it's quite difficult to come up with legislation that does though to be too restrictive\nIs the whilst one pass and may fail under pressure to respond to survive as old as you know everyone's watching as a difference another person my value the freight and that leaves in the face and being able to access systems for a

if you have to leave to collect the child but you still go to ... to make you can do on the run and that's to some people in ... it becomes very difficult thing to say that there is one rule that should save everyone\nElse was what it does indicate is it because of what communication because communications the wages that we have the Munnell smartphones we have ... phones the delineation between your home life and what life is becoming increasingly blood and I imagine that ... communication is a lot to do with that\nI think that's true I think you know as I said we access what stuff\nI had when we come and help us I was equally we were looking at what sustenance to grandma ... in our minds that distinction becomes blood and we probably don't switch off as as we would have done in the old days where\nWe left work and there was no puts ability to connect with the office except for the phone call what happened then is already that people's right to preserve see in the home from work\nHas already been some diminished I think it's very difficult question because that is the right to privacy but it's not an absolute right say it's all about balance seven employee on one side of the scales has the rights to\nPrivacy which encompasses a right to sexual interactions that the right to correspondence\nLights it formed social relationships\nWhether that's that was cool I ... ... ... really look at that sort of a geographical location when they correspondence with ... say what you spend on sexual ... will you send in a workplace system it can still be passing it could still be private\nBut equally on the other side of the balance if you like all of the employee's rights to protect the business to protect that reputation and it's about balancing those two conflicting often competing\nSets of rights and the the little has to tough to find that balance have you had any cases where you should have worked in a gray area where that we're trying to find that balance\nI think it comes up all the time because if if you say they blaring between highly became I think what I mean there are plenty of cases in court say one of the most recent leading cases if you like is a case before the U.
