this\n[noise] All right that's ... on the report from the Louisville Courier journal ... documentary a three part documentary everyday Americans stops on the b._b._c. was service this weekend [noise]\nTo Liberia now what questions are being honest about how an American run charity set up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused instead\nThe more than me educational charity was founded by an American woman Katie might she raised millions of dollars I was even given a building for free for her when I was ... by then Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nBy two thousand fourteen three is offering launched a number of ... food ... they had been raped by organizations main coordinator Macintosh jumps and he\nWent to prison and they died of aids to the ... the ... he was able to operate ... funds despite the scandal and as many people might be well one man who took up the story in a year long investigation he's young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by the public eye and time magazine\nSo this is an organization that was that was set up by American ponder marketed as basically they've been golfing sexual exploitation but in the background or come to our main bought on the ground\nWas exploiting many of the girls and then what we were looking into it was like whoa whoa what are the girls started to buy widespread was what happened then when you post Johnson died in twenty sixty or what was the circumstance of all with implications\nNow Macintosh that you speak all these the the men involved the ... the man who's actually exploited and abused these young women he was a Liberian himself\nAnd he was one of the people instrumental in that and she needs finding do for the school wasn't tea which in itself was quite amazing\nYes but like a ghost junk than New York to find these vulnerable girls ... support or scholarships that later in our school he describes himself as a former child soldier well I think in the in the context of West point would be highly vulnerable girls over any power he had\nMultiplied as a consequence of internationally funded scholarships without public ... more than the academy which\nWhich was really something that weapon use over over Liberia he managed to get\nHe managed to get to the east coast to the school and then it was found out that he had been abusing them in the southeast quite central to this whole story because how was it discovered the\nFirst girl came forward um in January of funky for the ... and that was for the schools are and the nurse was also aware that the closeness between a John spin on ... you had to form or another relationship or could have affected\nHow she was perceived but she came she came forward with this news as a consequence there was a five month late and which according to police report we've all girls were right but then in ... there is there is in Iraq\nAnd more girls we can go forward\nAnd and then ten girls press charges but according to a charity document as many as ...\n... young girls but it happened under the auspices of the challenge he reaches the base to be looking off do these go the charity we raised mainly in the money saying they are saving these skills from sanction exploitation giving them an education\nMultiple girls told authorities but if you saw with the public school boxing on the first date and going forward but that's also a reflection of the fact that in Liberia badly the resources are\nAre often below that if someone is able to access to resources like Milo was able to weather or through quicker than campaign but they sure are left are like more traditional Boehner I think that when someone is able to accept the money and provide services there can be not to shoot up well OK it might not be perfect but maybe it's the best we're going to get\nYou see the questions ... why would they still allowed to operate by the government when this whole scandal came to light that found that dozens of girls um\nAt least ten of them than he could be ... ... ... some actually and what may pregnant by this man named ... by him and had to jump out to school why is it they were still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging isn't that because any time there's abuse there's always a community was always on a neighboring element from the people who either knew or should have known for those who are benefiting and and then didn't take the steps to safeguard\nThose who are more vulnerable but one of the girls to report former stories story when we spoke when he spoke to her she had she felt she to bond with being abandoned by the organization and this was a girl that at a very hard life one of the girls who had gone through all of this must be brave enough to testify that that she regret the testifying because she'd been told by the organization but she did everything would be fine\nBy the end she felt she was little I think the key things that a member and all of this\nI think the key things for the member and all of this is about there was an imbalance that I'm sure about the ... more than me about resources at West point at work coming otherwise they wouldn't organization that was that the help of of the food is a little bit with all those who struggled to vote but even those who perhaps felt that they were treated badly or their wife or there was a fear that well\nMy story by telling my story\nI could lose what was what looked loving given by this organization that girl is going to step up\nAnd that in the news to find behind that film called unprotected released by the public at time magazine and a and the organization has actually issued a response\nYeah they say that they move the existence for children with safety health and education we horrified says the girls enjoyed this abuse at the academy and they say that they once they became to attention seeing yourself attention they reported it swiftly\nAnd that jumps and was arrested just four days off the scene yourself was notified of his criminal acts and they say we deeply sorry we're ambitious but it was so naive\n... one of the newspapers on page Jessica\nThat's on page aids serial rapes makes those sexual abuse scandal and cover up more than the chance to come to me they say\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

G\nA Turkish authorities maintain the gym this was killed up entering the Saudi considering stumble on October the second hand they say they have video and audio evidence to prove that\nThat's an accusation denied by the Saudi authorities\nWell some US Congressman as angry as this sounds taken by president Donald Trump he's vowed to get to the bottom of the case they say you should be more for flight and not just because Mr ... is a huge incident any I spoke to ... ... e nine make who's following this story from the\nBased on what members of Congress are saying they're hearing intelligence community it appears at this point that unfortunately Michigan's daddy and Saudis are definitely\nOnly responsible there's a lot of pressure coming from Congress to apply to sanction on at least the Saudi officials responsible for the fact drew some it was originally designed to go after\nRussian officials on human rights abuses so at this point I think there's mounting pressure and Washington to punish the Saudis at the same time it looks like President Trump for now it's sort of putting a pause on that\nAnd we should be clear to say that at the moment is just intelligence that said that it seems more than likely that the Saudis responsible they definite peace and yet\nThere is no the Washington Post says and U.S intelligence community believes that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and knew about this operation unclear whether it was intended to be something like this and it could have been a basically an addiction gone awry which is bad enough but yes it's looking very serious at this point\nThe question now what can be done what kind of a Sandy is Congress hoping that President Trump can bring to band aid because that I'm so lazy tell you that we stealing support\nWell I don't think that we're going to see anything that dramatic I think that there is some sort of sort of naming certain Saudi officials are of Arab on making a very difficult for them to travel and own things abroad at least in Europe so that's one possibility\nAt this point the basics of the U.S Saudi relationship whether the U.S all back away from the Saudi war in Yemen I don't think that those are really on the table as pain as as an appears this crime is\nThat something called the global ... as we're headed this and you tell us about tapes in why people are calling this out to be in\nThe global Magnitsky Act is\nKind of sanction against individuals\nAnd a government who are responsible for particular kind of human rights primer atrocity was named as hard as a way to go after the rash\nOfficials channel detained and ultimately are less your tortured and killed a lawyer working for hedge fund manager named bill Browder and as a result is basically trying to impose a penalty\nMaking it impossible to travel in the west at least and use money own things in the last part of that system at all and it's just sort of a powerful disincentive you obviously cannot do this against the head of state not everybody\nWill necessarily recognize it's like there's all kinds of places you can go but it is at least one way to sort of sending a message\nFrom one of the ... should now be sent to the Saudis we'd be gone to the engine\nNow would be the time to explain what you did if this is as bad as it seems man it's a kind of crazy thing to do the things that you could send a team of Fifteen people into another country and not have that other cats\nAnother country and not have other countries' intelligence service find out about it so in that respect it was a blunder as well as a crime and I think that the Saudis have to understand that the United states is the most powerful member of the U.S Saudi alliance and there are certain rules you can't cross in that respect\nAnd really the big point here is that you do not want the Saudis to act the way that we expect the Russians the Iranians are the north Korean staff we want the Saudis to be sort of in in this general space of course there on the U.S side when it comes to Iran and the middle east\nAnd he said that the U.S is the most powerful the U.S government also mindful of the fat one imagines at the fact that they have\nThe they show a relationship with the Saudis at the moment do you think that's one reason why they seemed to be well the quieted the mental although they're not coming forward they quickly to condemn the Saudis or act opened me to that\nThe Saudis are over the ... the main hand\nWas in the United states and Saudi Arabia or our allies that is true and as allies that is a different kind of relationship then to countries that are in our adversaries with us I mean that's sort of goes without saying my\nPoint is that there is a place where you can make it very clear that you're not sanctioning behavior that you make it awfully I think the u._s. hatched in that stuff and they have to make a very public case and say that this could never happen again\nAnd they ... they

Collins was explaining how to do to Lindsey false told them of heroin addiction\nNever in our wildest dreams did we ever imagine we'll be in the situation\nThough is that a a awards banquet for work and all of a sudden my phone starts blowing up with tax\nAnd you know was what the heck so I finally left the awards banquet went outside and Lindsay and certainly probably fifty Thaksin is like I Need help or I'm addicted to heroin of like where did that come from\nWe were so nice when\nFirst heard from ... Lindy had heroin problem I couldn't even spell it\nYou know the first time I sent my sister a message about it later you know is that you're selling it like a heroin addict novel\nOn a team of the BBC produces has spent six weeks working alongside John looks at the hundred and fifty in Louisville ... gentle as they report the opioid epidemic from the house of their community around ... ...\nCommunity so wrong that is one of the report to the last two white Kentucky had such high levels of opioid abuse\nOne reason is that that many years ago back in the nineties actually uh at the eastern part of our state the Appalachian region was basically a lot of pharmaceutical companies kind of targeted that area and and and they\nBecame ... there was a lot of pills are being prescribed and\nUh some people became addicted to those prescription pills that pain pills we have a high level of of pain and our uh Appalachian region which has a many coal miners and other people who are involved in manual labor and and uh end up with severe pain\nAnd and a lot of people just became addicted to those medications\nAnd then once the addiction took hold there really wasn't enough treatment Centers for these are folks and then when um when the heroin came around they took that because they still had the addiction that hadn't been treated [noise] you'll do\nKnow and you'll paper Laura I'm run a story with the headline pet owners abusing animals to get drugs would with I don't know about some\nPet owners were actually are going to they're vets hoping to get pain medication for the animals prescribe to the animals and then the owners would actually I used the pills for themselves or to feed their addictions\nYou so many people die over the years reporting this ... it's hard isn't it because as a gymnast you distance yourself from the motion of federal but what sort of impact did that to leave on you as a journalist\nWell it's been a a really um tough thing actually I've been covering a\nThe addiction crisis or for almost eight years and have seen a lot of a real heartbreak you know and families across the state because this this hits every ZIP Code or in our state and in our region I guess one of the\nThings that really stays with me is a I'm a mother of two and I've reported on babies being born drug dependent and so just seeing those babies holding them\nIs feeling I'm shaking my arms and cry and and knowing that you know they're suffering a and and they've just come into the world so they're coming into the world suffering and that that was I think the most emotionally\nThe most emotionally difficult thing for me to tell us about this blind the wool documentary\nExperience you had you had people in your office for six weeks to initiate yes we did and they\nWere in the trenches with us um I mean they went to uh the jail local jail I'm a very hard hit community in southern Indiana\nOr where they had a march or an overdose awareness day and I'm I've been writing extensively about them and also I mean they went to a ... a ride with the police\nSo they were with us and with families of course for for the entire six weeks just really in the trenches so I think they got a good sense of what we\nCover every day and and and you know kind of our lives as journalists\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by an American public media with support from see three I O T addressing the rules most challenging problems the convergence of artificial intelligence\nI T and the ... cloud computing more at sea three are owed to eat out a alright and progressive insurance committed offering a streamlined shopping experience\nAccording to their statements to police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charging talking\nDo you know how many girls will actually rages in number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh Johnson\nHow did the investigation unfolds will\nBasically this was an organization that has had some rumors around it\nAnd it was no one in Liberia that there'd been accusations of rape but but really no one had ever gone deep and to really find out what exactly happened and why it happened and also one of the interesting things about it is that the organization right after this happened it was never a negative repercussions their scope of operation within the country has grown\nThere was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nAre the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care or so when the ... came to light the organization essentially said and this was in their press statement\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central mine and they were going to station who died an intimate relationship with find or they\nDidn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him by giving him the power to the educate these these girls through their scholarships and also give them access to the school and then when it came to light he had been reaping these girls they essentially said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures in a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl\nThey mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but\nTo a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according\nTo multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so while the organization took steps to make sure that the ten girls who had testified against him were tested and they didn't take steps to ensure that the white or student population also were tested so what we know is that to students who are named dozens victims by indicted\nTested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization according to our investigation really failed to confront and a meaningful way and uh\n[noise] so what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate do you know there'll be any changes of told to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to improve its hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually there was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were for the first time according to their statements\nAt least some definitely the organization type the policies\nBut almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up with the rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak hit Liberia at that time and the organizations founder and the organization overall we're courted very strongly by international press subsequently gave him either who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months since these rapes in our organization coming to light\nJournalist Finley young ...

to something else maybe something less dynamic him what does that mean that politics can lead it this way to to make big sacrifices\nWell there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the theater now nice half how to\nFind a tunnel is ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius Steinbeck I he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than a nuts you rebel he's one of the authors of this week's I PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to teach anything like that target festival\nTo clarify up the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the government has asked do you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen independence agreement on it was clear duck two degrees of global warming was no safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warm into one point five and noticed report\nClearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is milk on track currently the pledges of the countries that have submitted under the parents\nAnd lead lead to increasing emissions over time until twenty thirty whereas a mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSaid paint a picture of Warsaw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nYou own teasing out slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to and you know by specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is coming up those is going to have to be allocated I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that\nThey're actually putting things into you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging to be as one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at the same fall we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable lives how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible a signing on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights with other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of well that is both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people and it said that the ...\nAnd it said that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to ten but some people were saying that these ... out and they said we know that there are some costs however\nShort term costs that's an equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples\nWe know that the increase of seeing an extra see the price of things that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no do says what we can say that\nThese losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to\nCompensate for these short term law office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in may be the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall\nBenefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to me to get these short\nTerm ... if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the drums and we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can totally that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the ...\nSay the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point for parents to get for example I can see that now and the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they imagine a world of these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who's going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does\nThis reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... degree are forming this is not in the\nFar future this is um one point five at the current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that down the road and finally\nThe report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law where he wants to come back\nAnd yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or just made a lot has been done we have a Nineteen nine countries we've been able to see the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three\nYears or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly so he says making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance it's a great no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution that can economically speaking however what we're seeing is that it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to\nRealize and there's been um scholars and political science working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing that renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been more expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of ...\nBut in an increasing number of applications and countries and the patient they're beginning to be competitive so\nIt's nice invest managing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough\nAs they say the report is reminding us okay um but I I Do think this point and he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable are not hurt is not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons it was only in that situation do you get to support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the\nGlobal economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand uh Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety slim will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast the now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ... case had\nAn you eat the gal was taking a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics he likes to look into you can ... the real story at BBC ... cake will

the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Julius I'm begging without effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office of the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and it uses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nFast to argue for a week or a vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have that particular view on the science that they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disown that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I I'm In the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the points the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh it's with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to tackle the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence that climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that\nIs pick up because it's sea level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf well partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the Trump environmental or climate\nAll our climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years in a row try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with it Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and development in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy to I Want to talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies me already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got\nRight now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda that is much more to talk about renewables but at the scene that maybe just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in health\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel\nDoesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of all do that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused\nPrices that if you liked caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat it Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries but arguing the knock must take action fist\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save that going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways\nTo bypass the mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question is what the pension funds going to do with those fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't mean developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you\nThink for a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is a force is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I really think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India\nThey really suffer and there's a strong reason to take their views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\nFresh

in admitted that they could be more diplomatic bumps and bruises along the way as he tries to persuade Kim Jong un to give up his nuclear weapons are correspondence Laura Becca did the interview\nWhen it comes to the has knowledge of war president moon is the son of North Korean refugees do one of the first questions I asked him was was this more personal than political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of war the separation of war I you know as I said his parents like North Korea Nineteen fifty three to never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wants to be president effects Korea with to help prevent war returning to the peninsula\nAnd for those who lifted all boats Advil knew that the the fighting here on the Korean Peninsula ended in Nineteen fifty three with an armistice never a peace treaty and now both north and South Korea would like to see\nTo see some kind of end of war declaration and so that they can work towards the peace treaty but to do that they need to not the United states\nAnd the U.S is unwilling to do so until North Korea makes real concrete steps to disarm and give away the nuclear weapons\nThat came out in the middle here to try to mediate between at the U.S and North Korea has been at president Moon Jae in\nAnd he has had three summit with Kim Jong un this year and he says that Kim Jong un is committed to complete denuclearization\nAnd that he understands that that means dismantling his current nuclear arsenal bought president made admitted that he hadn't talked about how that process would work in detail or look at a time table but he hoped\nThat would be ... at the next the United states North Korean summit which could be quite soon\nAlso Laura he's heading to Europe this or this coming week ... ... and really interesting he says that they will be bumps and bruises along the way but he hoped European leaders will help to mediate between Kim Jong un and Donald Trump if negotiation stole\nI mean and the past a European leaders have kind of look to the ... approach with North Korea yes they are quite and\n... well they certainly support the United states approach current United States' approach will maximum pressure they've been finding out for that but in the past they have looked to kind of more carrot and stick approach is so incentives to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons\nAnd he may be looking for president main certainly has it seems to be traveling to Europe with the hope\nThat European leaders can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies in his past towards peace and I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nOne knows and we wound up until ... until we moved through the swing markets tend not to me straight up in straight lines are straight down they move in a suit to patent and that's why everybody gets nervous\nOr if you tell me go up a lot or every time they go down a law that these nerves do have other issues over in Asia for instance ten samples planning on having an ... an initial public offering of its music division that was looking to raise two billion dollars worth of cash which as we go to start trading on top of the twenty second\nNo more they have actually taken that one site and said we'll have to wait until the market settle down a little bit it thank you\nUsed it from the BBC ... come to shop for ... you know real questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you set up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as that\nYeah the more than me educational chance\nAnd then me educational ... he was founded by an American wedding cakes ... who raised millions of dollars and was even gone to a building or by the then president and injunction leaf by turning the fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charged you will still able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month to up the story in a year long investigation on his name is really\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called West Point when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often then managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements to police had been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten\nWhen the ... began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff of the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge talking\nDo you know how many girls will actually rages in number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh wants one of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that\nThat the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in his care\nSo when the rates came to light the organization essentially said\nThat this was a community issue according to our investigation they minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with to find out they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they had empowered to him and then based actually said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations owned and operated\nIn cultures in a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access to abused young girl\nDemand ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that these girls would be ... actually affected as well\nThe challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there are many other students who had been named as also\nI was also his victims so what we know is it to students who are named lessons victim spots indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate just generally there'll be any changes at all to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's certainly true that the organization\nSought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements that the\nPolice so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the ... brick hit Liberia at that time subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named time person with a year\nWithin six months that these rapes and our organization coming to like\n[noise] and that was journalist I'm\nHugh ... speaking to me\nUm the school foundation of gold molded me has made the statement ... timbre of girls named John some of the
