I'm a now Google say yes we did find that we didn't think he was serious enough however we are going to shut down Google Plus which seems like a dramatic mood but that was very few people using it in the first place so this is kind of\nAlmost pushing Google Plus out of its misery because he was always something of a something of a dead network walking is the phrase I think would fit nicely here was\nThis comparable to a ... a kind of data access beat the bridge\nThese kind of circumstances of what was possible ... exactly the same ... the the only real difference between the two is that Facebook you know is the biggest social network in the world with two and a half billion\nUsers Google Plus\nBelly hides well that they said the number affected by this ... was half a million of issues as they say can I not may have been the entirety of the side because they said how popular Google Plus days and many people suspect that that low number wasn't because it was\nThere because the fact was minimal I just because they say if it wasn't that many people using Google process about quantity of uses rather than\nA any any difference between the two two potential breaches\nI Wonder what this all means for the protection um and especially with all these questions are rising about the the the need to regulate the Facebook them Google's of this world a bit more\nYes we'll Silicon Valley is absolutely petrified of regulation right now with a loving regularity we saying Silicon Valley bosses facing the Senate in Washington one of the things the ... general discovered internal memos\nFrom the time they discovered this law saying if this was public it could result in increased pressure from regulators um and that's one of the reasons why they they decided not to disclose what they'd found\n[noise]\nAustralia has just had his dries month a hundred years thereafter suppose many people will land to look for new what seemed to change what they're doing\n... ... ... bridges and the small rural town of ... with a population of two thousand people in your dreams as good to have you on river and let me start by his first of all how has the droughts affected you and your work\nI think that's probably why\nProbably in three wise a fussy personally or just setting or the damage down about people having to say stock and do it with lots of water and that takes off in their family personally in the ...\nI think it's affected at church or in the sense that I'm a ... and a financial giving a has affected the white played\nWalter my mobile and also true in the ... to be what was it like then what is it like now\nA Web site ... guy back ten years when we first moved to ... the church could afford to fulltime ministers\nA and a handle on night what pi bond money through the plight three regular for tree on a Sunday or at the mine and ah we probably up writing a at a bat fifty percent of on budget and that's on the employee one step\nInside free and they ... you mean history has ... ... what does this all the time you know you're going to be ... well ... ... ...

information all together into a risk school genetically school and this is a measure your genetic risk you take this risk or\nSo here you're cutting out the lifestyle choices that site and just going straight to what you are given out the genetically\nYes I mean obviously lifestyle because I've pored over this allows you to assess your inherited risk of building called the heart disease\nAnd given that does it make sense for example this test should be done on children so you know the earliest possible stage might be a risk\nSo many factors like your lifestyle sectors of physical activity smoking diabetes we tend to assist them in middle age\nWhere your DNA you wait for them but we can really apply this genetic test gotta you inherited risk at any age you can be they encounter of course it would probably wouldn't want to share that information or expanding to a child but I Would say that if you are\nTeens or even the young adult that I think knowing this risk or it can be helpful in reading private\nPreventing hobbies is developing if you start doing that at the age of forty or forty five ... approach has already started severely into this the better\nTo say this test is done on an Eighteen year old it finds out not person he's predisposed to ... to problems will be the the next step then\nA really important question because many people feel that you can't do anything about your inherited risk and that is really not the case if you find people that high risk particularly for those individuals saying that\nThose individual saying that changing your lifestyle particularly no smoking making sure you're you don't wait ensuring that you're taking over physically committee and of course some people using drugs like that is what was your age maybe very beneficial in preventing that it is\nHow far are we away from this test been widely used\nSo the technology that you know in terms of the thing is sort of various and you're either way simple

one of the original African American icons of cool the term that I'll be cutting with my guests on this for him from the BBC well service on the origins and meaning of cool I'm Bridget Kendall\nThe idea of who has been a more civilized and music poetry and praise fashion and films the weather's find its way into many different languages it's something that millions of people across the world to spot you and today it's practically a commodity a way to help sell products but what exactly is cool and\nWhy did it come from some even argue that it's impossible to define though I suspect that my three guests today will try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joel dinner scene a cultural historian a chilling University in New Orleans and author of the origins of who in postwar America\nIn Massachusetts is Claudia Springer professor of English in film studies at frowning and State University here eight James Dean trying to get the many faces of rebel iconography\nAnd we'd be in the studio is the writer and courageous Carol ... professor the Chelsea College of arts in London who started the concept of cruel and her two thousand and sixteen book the birth of cruel style narratives of the African diaspora\nWelcome to all three of you and just start with I Want to talk to each of you in time if you could just pick one example of who or what is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why do\nI don't like to choose an epitome of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Mohammed Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them a main and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that call had to change into something more confrontational\nAnd so he didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forefront in probably ten million dollars in their earnings\nAnd the earnings and he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the red people\nSo he was an activist even though Americans thought he was in fact sort of not keeping his place as an African American close yeah what about you\nCarol can you briefly remind us of who was Miles Davis and why is he considered an icon of cool\nWell Miles Davis was an African American trumpeter and band leader and became iconic in terms of how he changed just music\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home to sit with much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then in terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd this man I'm jacket and yes small Chuck kitchen is high and things like that he would\nBuy clothes from shops on university campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise]\nSo it's very unusual Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in a um ... jacket beautiful pastel colored quite close to ... I Know we should underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black that far I Am dealing with it\nHe's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men you are too expensive universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself exactly it's not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why\nWasn't this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public tickets hat but more generally in sexual terms because he said something about your family you know how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties they where we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stress this idea of visibility that sense of pride making a life for themselves and Britain despite all in spite of the racism the pull up our system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties\nTeen sixties so there was this continuous actually if you like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nSo up to this point we've defined coolest largely an African American ... something that was developed my job's musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one and Casablanca one time in New York [noise]\n\nMall and Jimmy Johnson all the towns and all the world\nShe walks in a mine\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael coaches including this was a new type of crew which ... the concept to the Hollywood movie audience with the new popularity of what was known as filmed well how does filmed while relate to a coup\nWealth film water protecting us are disillusioned I'm cynical owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn the shadow when water world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why do you think there's this idea these heroes these coups here is so resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface\nThere was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future so for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a ... way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody\nKill to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film in the war was not this was a John or that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nAnd Joe you set the cool appeal if this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front of ... says like oh but ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence\nOr Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of mad and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool is he says that I rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if your rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model\nFor fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\n[noise] we've been talking about jobs have been talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society and different countries [noise] the thing that strikes me is that all these kinds of coup seems to be men where the women can women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she has to be seen as a female ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in aspects of that\nAspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of my identity and that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female cool I come in jazz today what about you and Phil new ah [noise]\nAh in film and why are women were often cooler than men and why are women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film the water from fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... seen mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the weather that the icons of who seem to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThat tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to as cool in a headline or is that description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the band sonic youth from the eighties or in the nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in a minute we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken out by later generations that's in part to this forum from the BBC well service straight off to the new summary\nOf the b._b._c.

I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a court from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to this was a film ... for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point here that these with the new teenagers very much opposed wool phenomenon\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence\nIt's I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nCount all the style that these films to fashion came to be seen as cruel too didn't they just want us the actors\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the teacher to white T shirt nice everyday object which started um

rebels spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n[noise]\n\nJoe so what did Elvis fits into the pantheon of cool\nElvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando it's kind of a shock looking back\nUh but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues ... he was doing something somewhat a rich you know\nWith the African American rhythm and blues tradition and so although he has often sort of seen as inappropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American beers\n... at the time also enjoyed his singing and his take on the Afghan or contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rock is an energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe image of people like James Dean into Elvis Presley on popular culture house of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of coup across the clay but I Wonder what you will think how we really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named were I kinds we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view\nOf the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music in Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nThat cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and\nCorrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere is I found that to ... post colonial rebels um the French found la Han from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets and which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out\nHow to respond to police violence who bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish one of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cool detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of coups cultural imperialism\nFor me it's not just about the kind of a tough thing down if you like but it was that what Claudia angel it being thing is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a\nParticular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground the way one style of cool is being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing who hasn't remains static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cruel but it seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream of conformity that we've been talking about so when's cool today there's\nCool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grass roots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and

assault against Mr Kaplan\nThose accusations were fabricated by Democrats the president said before he apologized to Mr Kavanaugh for what he called the campaign of political and personal destruction against him\nNow we'll know much more now about Supreme Court justices of how they're appointed and how recently certainly the appointment system has been intensely political does it have to be like this particularly at a time of increasing it seems political policies on ships\nWell next guest will tell you it doesn't have to be that way but we've been talking with professor Jonathan Turley about

Democrats are likely to retake the house\nBut suddenly the Senate seemed and play that process did change after the cabinet controversy it did fire up Republican voters and so many people believe that the Senate very well could stay Republican\nThere's no question this was a powerful political moment for both parties and I think that Trump is trying to keep that fire under Republican voters until we hit the mid term election\nRight when it comes to public perceptions\nOf the Supreme Court which is hugely important part of the constitution the American way of life the accusations that the Democrats of of being ... this whole house how well is that going to run into people remember the Republicans using it for ... value as well not that long ago I think this is really\nA scandal in the

Rosa Parks\nAnd they became my mentor that I never met I used to talk to them that critically\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf guy and he started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteers who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was a clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to treat a lot of people we went up when he sees in our clinic\nSome people get cholera some people get typhoid sweet adequately reaching civilian guys what do we do\nSomeone at the committee had a suggestion and I'd be a kid like you know what\nOf fear edge and by the guy on\nThe air [laughter] ... [laughter]\nI don't know where the ... will\nBe clean no see which\nWhen it's dropping you see the ...\nAnd I'm like wow\nThis is a good idea this idea we just want somebody who knew somebody the community we just sat there and you're like wow indirect let me think about what let's get the pie in yeah this is Chris and yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way and that's where Kenny experience in states us in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people that maybe if I might be one of them are criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes I don't mean to me that they started cutting the pipes on Fox they started cutting you'll pipe yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will really be or not to be a wife or their children\nTo be the ones that they want to you know a kiosk so I'll forgive them income that's why we're able somebody\nThen there's a delay out so well by that is that some times that they sell their water we don't stand mostly on the weekends we don't do send water for that day they said they own water there\nThis is Kenny old over he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWe set for two shootings and they said for Penn\nSo you will say it's clean at my ... clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your expansion plans yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to walk them root for the ... without too you know with the impact of the system so that's your what's your ... [noise]\n\n\n\nJust listening to Kenny tell his life story the some makes me realize that he really is the\nKey to this solution here and we say are always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slump smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the yeah\nDidn't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kennedy just up on his own doing this in Kibera it's a large organized\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think is now a bit less still is a lot of money the ... yeah I put all of that just shelf go\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size or everything's being signed off by the bullets so okay in for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment well they bring in a lot of money shelf go just want to two million dollar prize\nFrom the Hilton foundation the hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the what the shelf go does not just the water but there are other projects to buy the only one Sam who are trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nThere are lots of different people and organizations thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums and\nJust in Kibera a United the country they all said and I'm thinking one woman she's in Wonder Woman with ... she was a gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just putting it up and passing it out so they got the ... the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime than illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... a little different players involved as you said it's how does ... fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... pipes infrastructure in the slum itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes they come with some\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet of foot because you know fast doing things on the ground you know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf chi their grassroots organization that led by the parents as folk barons they didn't want to hang around whites\nAround waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible mental was\nMy mother in law mountain that I'm gonna be Rosa Parks this is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nThese men and women who don't just sit down and watch when this was happening\nAnd what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down at which point and that was as a result the answer for that to be

access and accessible we're called five hundred women scientists do at five in our women scientists within America are succeeding and we want to make five hundred women scientists within all the

fifth most popular website we keep ... apparently she wasn't well known enough so what's going on\nRebecca hey get is a lecturer in history of science at the University of Kent she says to understand you have to look at the historical role of women working in science\nIt's about how science developed and how it to find a space within the culture and within society so when you get science developing sort of the new philosophy it was it was it was understood and the seventeenth century\nIt wasn't something had a great deal of all ... wasn't necessarily typically well understood it wasn't necessarily seen as being you know relevant to ... to ordinary people or whatever it was so it had to find ways of developing its own oath or see\nA one of the ways to do that has often been to exclude women because women was seen as perhaps being\nIt's being more dangerous or less serious or less intelligent or whatever because of the way that gender roles as being constructed so we sometimes find women systematically being excluded where they may want to touch and don't pay anything\nBecause that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the ... more authority\nAbsolutely and particularly once you get to science things see and it's something that's relevant in the public sphere so women not generally left I tip into public said they'd been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a mascot and kind of ... ... it's going out and earning a living and so and so when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments we were talking\nLate Nineteen centuries before when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a a Korean policy can fall I say a a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish in\nAnd a roots by which you can expect to live and so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite late tone\nAnd by that point when that very much being excluded from those of cheating in historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places like that happens so the role it's averaging credit she's one of those places where you might living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing a geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you're not finding people doing scientific research within you invest states for example so yeah it's really only make sure on that you get the kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that there's so much she paid to do ... particular problem\nIs is pretty much across the ... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe\nI'm ... I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and water will say get sort of taken up in in America although interestingly there are more opportunities for women in what is a very new university system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach a strong to be in the women's college so what was that in the U.S and they are in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings the women I mean probably over and it sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps so we do\nSo we do find women there in a way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you've got to opt for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given\nPlaces that interesting the thing that you say that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I can look interesting that in when you look at the desk of figures on women in science for example that some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose because I said where's the the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love to know more\nAbout the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or are we talking about investing systems\nYou know what is the kind of funding that goes into research within universities and there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect there may be longer focus some women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded\nAnd way there are places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find\nWomen funding and opportunity because men are not taking the option to get there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own\nFollowing the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of established individuals' usually male who publishing in those areas and some interesting late we sometimes find that that gives women an opportunity until then often to start paying that then push that so far a\nTypical an iconic example of faxes computer programming which early on was very much seen as a\nFemale role we sort of associated with lots of ... old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In a very liberal very ... so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left to women to do this work but when it was understood to just tell me ... teaching was going to be\nWe find that it stopped being paid more scenes they will ... stitches on women have them being similarly shelf Dr phil [laughter]\nRebecca get lecturing history of science at the University of can't just how much wouldn't get filtered out was brought home by surveying the u._k. a few years\nA few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public was unable to name a single famous female scientist so to end this program we've compiled the views of women working in stem subjects and awesome to name that stall female scientist you'll hear new pig every time a name is mentioned [noise]\n\nMy name's Roma structural engineer and my engineering hero is Emily ...
