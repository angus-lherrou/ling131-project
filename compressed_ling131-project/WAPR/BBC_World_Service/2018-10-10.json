always ended up working with people who later became friends and then I kept repeating working with them\nSo up to be honest I avoided a hug ... problems\nAnd the way you deal with them is to avoid working with them to do where you vocal against these people that are passed these yes in the beginning I\nJust said that okay no thank you I work with some other people because I I I don't I I'm not going to succumb to something like this but if you know the thing is it's never did act it's always it comes in I'm In a suggestion\nAnd when I got that suggestion I just I just said that will get fine I'm not going to need that person anymore\nAnd so in the beginning in the first one to yours my career that's what I did and then in the industry everyone has a reputation right on the reputation

because they know that it's not going to happen with me and uh so I ended up working with people um I continuously ended up working with people repeatedly working with people who became friends

you know back Fifteen Years back when I started working\nLike I wouldn't ah come out in public in the press and say that also and so I Try to do that with me and that's I'm not working right right I Would just say okay like forget about it I'm not looking at that person because you might try to do that I because I felt that there isn't in in in when during a suggestion\nSo I said okay fine I Walk

you'll rewarding yourself to think if you remember with showers ... has seen happening inside\nRally wrapped up one round of testing and uh so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developer so it turns into like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better started to it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is now it's just about making it better and I\nCertainly will be a story that the ... yeah\nThat's right so each game is a a month\nSo sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce and ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people and it will qualities and some railway will begin what happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through season three and I'll be watching it with a notepad in hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience where how their first games where\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend um\nTonight it's going to be to ... for player game we recruited them off the Internet using Twitter\nAs people I Do not know I've never met\nA lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like an entire evil know tighten your belt and seeing how much what I Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible as part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich data being in a room sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be a fly on the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nThere's almost a scientific discipline that you don't want to affect the results of your experiments that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really stuck\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world does he I came on ... on the late to legacy the ... pandemic\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules and then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise or you're trying to write a book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book and we'll send it off their translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nWas that language is from other countries filtering back in the game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be goal they all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on a cover you just won't sell it and Germany so if you think of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo at least that kind of postal German ... games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that\nIt fit into what were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural ...\nPost war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the post war aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred game developers gemstone [noise] selling gangs of everything you can imagine ... it was about ... ... ... creations of supernatural steam punk\nTempting

turnover but you just kinda got adept at at switching jobs and maintain a big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd the right in saying that you were working on what we call the personalization of the way\nI was working we're just starting to do what with social networking those apps are just kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications say something that no it was really defining tech coach at you kind of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on this that people didn't want to put their photo op on line because I thought that was being too public a set that we take for granted\nNow or was it was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just beginning to understand what they like to like making up a gate that you'd share with people and now you know you couldn't see the United states you know basically ... everywhere but it back in time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns we're helping to document those and share those events wise that's across the opposite\nSide of the defining still\nStill the coach now isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you figure that if you see it everywhere I mean people are checking I found hundreds of times a day\nWhich really struck me the these days is that you know work in a mostly on a low failed he's kind of on plugged\nFrom something that society is awash with no social media because about face to face contact\nYeah it's one thing I'd really like about tabletop gaming it's very different from a electronic aiming at you you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across the earth dining room table because people an excuse to to be with each other and that that is one thing I really love\nWhat was the importance of this time away from screens that games while you're on the line\nBut I think that devices that really isolating you know in your eye on your eye patter your honor X. box or whatever they say they forget to connect with people

Somali\nLA also but then also but within the scope of his boss community of\nWorldwide Muslims still makes Jordan are really unusual thing to be but it just I just wonder whether it for you it is the religious practice that's most important all the social activism that goes with it\nBoth actually the worshipping I've got it is only ten percent of the words that we do in the mosque because we have the friday prayer but besides that Ninety percent of our work it's centered around human rights work\nRecently I had developed together with the group of activists in Denmark nine thesis of Muslim reform based on Islamic principles of justice\nAnd these nine thesis are of course women's right to serve as female moms today it is still too many Muslims something very rare and and strange and before we started the mosque two years ago in Denmark\nIs a million miles from mules so how can you compete\nIt's not a matter of competition it's a matter of establishing a solid alternative to walk had this and to Salafists and Islamist and it's about establishing they sell it all tentative we're actually not here to\nWe're actually not here to fill it to my eyes Islamist groups or traditionalist groups are conservative\nBut here we are doing you're using the movement show Geneva old old systematic discrimination\nBut the but the thing is how do you do it how to hit delivery of criticism I always think of my criticism in a very nuanced a form and I think that really crucial the thing it's here that I'm here to create an alternative I'm here to surf\nAnd Utah ration of

Saudis I was talking about the conservatives or the tradition in this because the majority of Muslims and then like our tradition and it's all conservatives and\nDid you ... do you agree with this is a really interesting words the came from a President Obama's former State Department envoy to me when communities around the world of them as a petite and she said this at the end of the posting off to you know considering what you eat in the Muslim world she said\nOf sound influenced she said it's pernicious and universal in each place the to the hobby influence was an insidious presents the U.S must do sort of the U.S must disrupt the training of extremist moms do should be concerned about the way in which the Saudi money I assume we actually like to share\nThat concern a lot and that's that's why I have this stuff is this as a tip we want to create alternatives what to disseminate\nYou notice on his arm in Europe and abroad and we're not only talking this is about creating change on the ground and if we look at the ... at the changes that we have made so far and let me give you an example\nThan a ... of interfaith marriages today muscle and that cannot marry outside their faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural Muslim or you do not\nReally practice on so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married in the mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\nRereading the Koran and with a focus on gender equality allowing women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they've changed the law last year and a separate Seventeen so now it's also\nIt's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been that possibility for the man because they've stated clearly in the Koran that a muffin man can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim but the the other said it's not stay the candy but it it's not stated either that a woman ... so we use that as our Timothy\nBut you go to another problem there are many people in Denmark a\nPolitician's if the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and all of Its Food to\nLook at you and feel that you represent a danger because you you appear to make\nIslam more acceptable to a Danish minds when in fact they say many of your core such huge or just the sort of

they wanted to to establish a magical sphere with women only when women could say what they want and express themselves\nAnd in the beginning I was really I was really sad about the ... flood I didn't back off I accept and that's the power democracy you how did that the majority it's good to know when you have to uh I have to make the constitution and because the conclusion is vital\nWhen you want to create change you have to understand the art of flourishing\nIf you burn all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder there's no I I really ... that\nBecause we have a women's ... only on friday at all other days it's for men we have men coming from different countries to pray because we are centered in the middle of Copenhagen as the only mosque very but my my my point was that\nIf you want to create change you have to do it slowly and ... and we can do the real revolutions\nBy the interfaith marriages given women the right to divorce we can do these things\nBecause we are actually unsafe theological problem because nobody can criticize that\nIf you are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way of looking at it\nAway in the middle of that is your philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never the neo bridges and that by that way you achieve change\nWhat I'm hearing from you is that it is a very delicate insensitive balancing act let's just take one more example and I think a number of things you a quote unquote your political opponents on the right to regard your stand after that a crisis over the cartoon\nIn a unit in Boston in ... I think it was oh five it first came out with that cartoon became a sort of litmus test and then months of whether you are supportive of\nFree speech that runs of old opinion or whether in the case of many Muslims in the country you said that the offensive ... dot com tuned to you trumped all else now it seemed\nTo many that was that that ... and what you do that shit that's not my quotation though I'm not quitting but\nThis is your quotation uses freedom of expression in your view must be used more delicately Sam said when is the dialogue the ... the cartoonist in this case is claiming to establish to tended to many dangers do you actually\nAre defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon\nNow not on the other hand I with new on saying that debate\nI set that we have to understand that we're living in a globalized fault and if you're living in a globalized while you have to ask yourself what tell you what do you want to have a dialogue with people and you're not talking they said that they wanted a dialogue with Muslims and then like so if you really truly wishes a dialogue\nYou have to understand you have to ask me sensual question what is important to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many Muslims and the well so we we have a group of friends who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nValues who are essential\nTo them at the same time so it's not a mattress as favoring the sacred this of the crime over freedom of speech it's a matter of understanding that if you want to enter the dialogue have time to start that people they have different principles of what is valuable at the same time\nAnd and I I Do a ... century ... to ... that that you watch\nYou are trying to find a very fine line to conduct your work and you say yeah but you've written the book and it's all about how you want to see a sort of a feminist take within Islam and I understand a lot but you say at the end in a very searing the onus passage at the end of this comes at a price list is not easy\nAnd we have to pay a price if we really wanted to fight for our principles and values and you paid a very personal price which you reveal at the end of the book says it cost you your marriage yes\nTo an end who you you kind of ... is a good man but he was of Pakistani Danish origin his view of his religion was different from yours he felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage white with it\nYes it was worth it because I think that that so many people they want the recognition they support the revolution and they want to change it\nBut they just don't want that delta or their wife to their head up the rather to show and somebody has to be a head of the revolution felt to me it was not a matter of choice I didn't make a choice\nBecause I place myself a head of the revolution and it's impossible to withdraw when you're just out of it\nBut that has a cost that goes beyond you your husband the coolest your children your wind a family that must be something that weighs heavy [noise] of course it does of course at that\nWhen you're at peace with the decisions you have taken the fight you are fighting\nI'm at ... ... my children are very proud of what I'm doing and I have\nFamily who who really supportive so I'm at peace\nTreaty and kind of\nFascinating and thank you very much for joining on hold thanks you\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
