you know there are currently\nRight now seven lawsuits filed against various opioid manufacturers and distributors we've alleged well first of all violations of the Kentucky Medicaid froth statutes\nThat they have a cause fraudulent claims to be made to the Kentucky Medicaid program we've also alleged violations of the consumer protection act because they made representations to the public to physicians that these things these drugs are safe\nAnd let me clarify that I'm not going after that because my son died that dropped on going after that because after the research I did and what I found out about\nIs the reason that I have pursued that he should have never had access to it many many other people should not have\nThis was a systemic issue you know all the way from the manufacturer all the way to the physician\nDown the line there were problems\nWe're seeking financial day which is so this is this is a case about money and you know and of course they'll never be enough money to fix all the damage that was caused you know that's just the fact that so I and as far as far as the number I I I don't feel comfortable talking about that today at this time to do all this but we're talking a significant sum of money that will\nGo to address the problem\nWell what's interesting as some of these drug companies are trying to get these cases all news federal court yes

casualties so many policemen were killed\nBut the government paid no attention to us he said we haven't even been paid yet what does that say about your government\nAs a national security adviser that is exactly what is on Monday to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges\nBecause I knew was one of the reasons I accepted in took this job it hurt me personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint\nAnd I'm dedicated me and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful of mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the NATO exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nI Know gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives\nOur country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nice enforces off from your own Afghan forces unfold walked because this is the more you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for them on a sunny and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOr our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a it it it takes more\nNow than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular\nThat the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently though Eric friends formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we showed a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan and why is that on my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time we were told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well\nUntil you and I'll and I'll I'll start because we have now I don't think it'll be a straight down and said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with uh the uh\nNew York times reported sources saying quote ... I had these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detail than what you see in a news report that just because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador\nObviously you didn't know he is very exhausted from his trip you didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own\nPolitical process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are uh in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do\nBone and drive the peace process\nAnd that's the only way for a success it's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take much to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's\nRight to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take well\nDuring the advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right towards stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and enroll the African people accept can only be known if they participate in the ... and then in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hotdog\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

something that we used ... usually use in the museum contact the calls that ink insensitive to temperature change\nOf temperature and space like this is it changing all the time so it's been very interesting to what with the axe that in this very specific material to understand how they think can really be affected in the space was been very interesting for us to learn is how\nIt responds to temperature so how receptive to take a natural for instance how we then what was I think\nHow we price the actual printing\nIn actual fact what's interesting is that the the tiles that will be laid

get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nAlso and takes resources to make that metal just like those plastic\nAnd takes energy\nAnd it's heavier as a consequence that may cause the airplanes and get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint\nSo those people who carry around the mental knife and fork in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic warned that doing the wrong thing or they\nOh I don't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think avoiding the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right\nAcross the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhat itself out ... is it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo it's outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling it or just throwing it in a landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single use plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back to a shopping refill and using many times as you want at home I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many a return of all bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years whether a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to screw up those bottles up and use them again it's not the single use\nWell there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to scrimp those bottles up and use them again it's not the single use plastics should be used it's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternative to sweet thing is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastics if you don't have the ... doesn't did a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion\nI don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures be expended so that it becomes written into global trade deals that\nWell as in not just the European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right now what is the only life in your plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature\nHowever one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem\nRight then you decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man eight out of ... that is for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic I missed the science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk may 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastics probably makes pretty good sense but getting rid of all I don't know\nAnd that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in in the nature and the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland

climate change that we see in the world today is such a pressing issues\nBut I Do think that environmental degradation on climate change that we're seeing in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need sweeping 'em urging action at scale on this\nAnd of course looking at plastic is not new um we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco\nAnd of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags\nUm [noise] I think it's a very welcomed development my slights um reservation is around the bottom plastic strollers in particular and I've been reading the concerns from the splits he writes ... campaign is about this\nAnd who talk about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws\nUm in order to be able to drink liquids and how to use metal ones or pay well I well actually other materials such as paper on mental a glass of silicon don't necessarily what so many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury\nAnd that can be a choking hazards metal for example is not safe\nFor hot liquids and paper dissolves with repeat to use 'em so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's a welcome development\nI'd also like to look not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well so I was really struck by the high proportion\nOf plastic in in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven cents off the lights are on the beaches from that and and I'd like to look at that as

much James Gregory research published last week suggests that using a mother's voice on the smoke alarm could save more children's lives than the conventional high pitched sounds that we associate with those loans\nA team at the nationwide children's hospital in the U.S state of Ohio carried out the study on one hundred and Seventy six children and they found underneath Hoff woke up to a noise like this on a conventional smoking them\n[noise] but it's about Ninety percent of children woke up to a voice in them sounding something like this like\nCop time to get back my cup\nDepending I suppose if it's your actual mother to continue to explain why this might be we tend to Daniel Glazer neuroscientist base here in the u._k.\nYour weight or asleep you'll since organs all taking in information from the world all the time she goes sound or smell taste your eyes even with your eyes closed a monitoring the world all the time and we have very sophisticated mechanisms from bus\nTo direct our attention to things that are important and to filter out the things that don't and actually it's the filtering out that's more important than the direction because if we were alive to everything that was happening all the time we'd be overwhelmed and so\nThe question is why do children's succeed to ignore things in their sleep better than adults\nAnd this is clearly true for any of us who've had young children alone or others you can take them to a disco practically let's say to a wedding with a pounding music and once they're asleep they stay asleep through and and the answer is that ... that developmental stage of childhood sleep is more important than knowing what's going on\nThis if you compare us let's say two elephants baby elephants aboard and pretty much immediately able to walk around follows the see the difference between safe in dangerous places a baby humans of bone dependent\nBe able to walk around follow the see the difference between safe in dangerous places a baby humans of bone dependent so the trade off we make us humans is that with ... unable to the cough drops elves and in that time with that early stage of development the first few years sleep is incredibly important\nBecause it's in sleep that we replay the experiences of the day strengths and the connections that we've developed and lose the ones that on simple so the tradeoffs that we make as humans is to\nBuild children that basically ignore everything when they're sleeping because sleep is more important than working out what's going on and that's because we're born dependent on our parents to the officer is\nA ... can fend for themselves pretty much from both humans calm\nNow the question of why your mother's voice is more important than any other\nIs an interesting story also about humans from before the with tuning in to sounds that method to us and so the first few months of life we're exquisitely sensitive to the whole range of environmental sounds that we encounter the kinds of music that we hear\nThe kinds of language that we hear\nA very very young ages changes that perception for the whole of our lives and so babies tune into that my voice is from a very young age\nAnd beyond the initial period\nBecause that is the sound that his most salient that's most relevant to them so it's not surprising that this ... results this a small sample a study that's just been reported finds that a mother's voice is much more salient much more relevant to the sleeping life of a human child than an ...\nDaniel Glazer who's in euro scientists where we thought

be ally ... [laughter] well that's true and may maybe some legal implications that right [laughter]\nBut you you want to buy the artificial intelligence implications or you might you generally but\nWell I guess [laughter]\nI I guess the idea that everything now has to be so kind of ... everything's so sophisticated on the digital level that we're losing our capacity to the basic things I mean I I can barely navigate around London anymore now without getting my city ...

G. and tea to introduce are fun to watch them on the program today I'm going to turn to the American soul singer James Brown\nMachine doing it you know [laughter]\n\nThey on the\nMachine James Brown with is Ninety Seventy hit single coming into the sex machine what\nJames Brown would have thought of today's world in which sex machines were actually available to buy it's anyone's guess you see the link or he might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robo to Brussels\nHave popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films haven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen seventies the step for wives where um ... women are transformed into do style husband pleasing automate sir\nAnd more recently the British movie ex machina which a female robot stabs ... creator the city is having use that word for a while to death\nSo robots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect on sexual behavior children after the room perhaps slides health warning Cape Devlin is\nAnd all sorts of ways but how will they affect all sexual behavior children after the room perhaps slides health warnings Kate Devlin is a senior lecturer in digital humanities at London universities King's College and she has the answer to everything you've ever wanted to know about sex row boats but were afraid to ask her new book\nIs called toned on science sects and robots and she joins us in Studio welcome Kate morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nWell in a way I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not that comes in the form of the\nCurrent ... is another story ... there's really no to any read eat we kind of have one in prototype that's jus to ship to customers anytime no I really and it's essentially a sex told her I loved all\nI'm with an animatronic hats\nOr how does your wife it's so different from a blow up love a wouldn't say blow up the things that quite expensive um they ... up with a [laughter] it's probably upwards a little too much too early Matt [laughter] dies in dollars upwards to buy one of these robots um five thousand dollars up\nWords if you just want to adult version or may not have silicone they are um sculpted they are they are kind of think it works of art um but they don't look anything like humans rated\nOkay we're going to dispel a few myths in a moment what do you make of the concept Chitra very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a essence\nRice effects robots kind of feel ... and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily ... you know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of ... is a humanoid form that that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body [noise]\nAnd and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body on sex robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow they're not yet there are not yet at this at a male version of a sex or will it tends to be I'm straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\nIs interesting because on most sex toys still does which suggests that the to the classic lead on would be a you know they'll do based sex ... so\nToys still does which suggests that the the classic lead on would be a you know they'll do based sex ...\nSo essentially there's something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of development to one is the sex toy like you say there's this big things like Elizabeth I breeders are mine for years and the other is the sex to all the sec still has always been a fan in the market for manned okay entitlement\nAnd some men in in sexual terms you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliant ever willing female figure is imported isn't it in the form of the passive sex do which takes what is given to it it it it's offensive to many people on all sorts of levels\nAbsolutely I I'm not something we'd be fed by sigh fight on the air is as well and of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman got to be a potato and the female robots or takes over it as a threat to Matt and I think there's a certain power levels is with real life than not fear\nUm but yes it is it's just this past of females form that we have and I I strongly I've kept me from the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew\nI'm kinda nervous the venture into this month we'll we'll have to admit poor when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it\nJust before I let you in the morning but K I honestly don't shy away you know I've I've noted my by my has raised sipping it became one can you tell us how you go into this topic what drew you to this you know I Want to dress like that it was to route\n[laughter] well I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about rainy from a sitting up in the pub after conference will come to the system was talking with a group of colleagues say and what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why why repeal this effort into creating\nA ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ...\nIt was kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly already but I Want an ... I Want to explore more oh we don't want to read about one sex robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men Forman says Gen did straight man what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes about it\nParticularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men woman says Gen did straight man what are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes around agency consent and lights\nAnd I'm also a link to that is not perfect analogy but when you look at pornography\nThere a particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put forward and pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept Gail ideas Kate\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight while I'm al ... is that top or any of that last word has her normative so the idea that people\nUm are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and um the church and in this case um it's it's a mine and a woman and it's it's a sex evils of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today old tend to be in this um\nSalmon eyes type of sexual form and they all tend to be white as well um whether they aren't where they're they're adults with a different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is probably my take on and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things and just to check out our we act\nThe technological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate opposed\n... not ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots\nWord so the problem is how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's kind of the nation I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time but we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly that also official intelligence as hyper realistic ... I mean\nThe ... or at least a robot can talk to you convincing absolutely so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] and this\nRobot these robots have add personalities that are being developed you can carry around ... app on your phone or tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend and your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic convincing human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception of your book tastes oh sorry to interrupt quick point we're going to\nJust hearing you Kate makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go frames and whether it is is this does it say something about how they got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not ...\nAnd whether it is is this does it say something about who called and got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at such a good friends that were talking about and does this say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and thought\nBecause I don't know how ... yeah I think that's there's probably about it and I think ... sort of the talks looking at the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we're able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems with a K\nDevlin author of toned down south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program picks thanks to August ...

a Robin you washing machine way you could control it using an ... thing say we went off to praise whether the suspected actually hit the button on the washing machine physically and that was in the building\nOr whether they were using the app on the night of fighting and if they will use an app was the fighting in the house who was the final slap\nTo the dismay and going through records from cell phone towers\nYeah so we're looking for more information on the line about whether it was connected to why if I had taken any ... any location based on the find\nMore information could you pick up the washing machine itself\n... when a sad thing had been pre set say if you set your laundry to be washed it say five AM you could get that information on one of these things are able to get where

which we had to re maize and then report on to a nice ... to ... to check\nMy ... but it was on the ... that this would be a particular manufacture I'm sure many of these systems are quite proprietor you I just wonder how are you even have a lot about data fall because it must vary according to manufacturers\nSay that's a nice ... digital forensics it makes ... say much more fun you're looking at a puzzle and trying to blackout how each of these devices wax on how each of them still is safe to\nSay it does involve a lot of playing with the device and try and different types of activity until ... stop too much and you can then whack out I had this cat and appears to me that the devices oh no the devices east and from that translate it into something meaningful\nIt's a bit like CSI were you have the washing machine you pass you alive you're wearing a white covered everything of course it's completely ... everyone's incredibly attractive and move up and then you've got like a computer that some of the list of ... to go to the gate and then somebody presses a button on a big green light flashes saying is if you served it must be definitely like that\nA sad thing that I Know what ... some fortune at age ... computer geeks and ... days that we read that are trying the washing machine again and again with different cycles and try and get with the fire and\nTrying to find connects to the like Hawaii fight that the washing machine was on trying to find a way from the device not and why\nAnd each time just looking at a day though it was still hold\nThe data itself comes out in binary format on from there it's just a nine year old case if going three and physically ... patents\nWhat was the outcome of this investigation around the washing machine\nSay we're able to shave the fighting was ... and I was not an site and that helped to show you that the the suspect was indeed involved in the ... and\nSo the suicide of this is the ... investigative it's computer science this is forensics in action and would I guess be quite typical of the many investigations and what you're going to vote\nYes a lot of the investigations are they called in a department as well as the mall

especially on global in nature what role can you as digital forensics expert supply and hoping to get some ... some of these scams for instance\nThat can be really varied depending on the nature of

can see a lot about the people have message you have a what they said\nIt might not be able to get it all back you can get really good indication of what happened and it's about making people aware that even if you haven't got a device it was sent from just a little you can get from the other device\nSo be warned about Sarah Morris so once in a lot about Sarah was telling me especially the gigs
