welcome to haul took\nThank you Steven good to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you uh accent that the\nWay those elections work cloud with so many Afghans\nAre facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee ... everything that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban or al Davis precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for

provided by da Andy is F\nA I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the

what is on my mandate to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges\nBecause I knew was one of the reasons I accepted into this job it hurt me personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement to our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful law mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said the ... so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life and know gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty\nOur country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold walked because this is the more you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't this is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives\nAnd protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see it on TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially\nI'm I ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to off on his son where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yes we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a water that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end a and it takes a it it it takes more\nNow than just a statements to be able to ah to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security is not to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\n... we don't have so much time has to my hips so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular\nWe we don't have much time to somebody so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently though Eric friends for many the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we showed a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nAnd why is that on my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time we told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well\nUntil you allow your story because we knew that I don't think it'll be a straight down and said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts\nTo engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote fills that I had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban\nSaying quote fills that I have these meetings with ah the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them an Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government\nHeard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one consideration for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not set in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador obviously you didn't know is very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own\nAny political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are a in Maine in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do\nBone and drive the peace process\nAnd that's the only way for a success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that old your investment in our and messed investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm already asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take missed the national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend election\nThe Taliban's right to stake in the governance of your country what would it take well\nWhere the Taliban contend elections\nThere more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite that threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and couldn't tendency where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the Afghan people\nChoose how ... we have to end it there but I Do thank you

how serious concerns about ... a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view if all that people in all the non and too I Would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know political parties in Northern Ireland devote persuasion is old say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border\nBecause unionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that\nThe Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from not\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders over the last few days

Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually have identified as one of the British union aside if things are now starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances\nAnd certainly it's something that's been discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every TV show every talk show every polling older by these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWhere in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us\nNot least because we're going to be the border between you and the u._k. but also in the context of the pie propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where their views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that

doesn't want any businesses in the u._k. see much which doesn't put a ... and on and and and and if that was enough which satisfies the e twenty seven\nSeveral be laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be felt that all the different parties that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of it is a fairly clear up because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see how can it the ...\nYou're absolutely right and I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that that we are in that if you like\nThere's a contradiction in the ... projects among the EU is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics Justin and if you\nIf you think about it what what was what was leave all about was taking back and I quote control of a bold us ... ... and all the money well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction us trade with the European Union and not have a quota in Northern Ireland\nUnless of course the European Union was to say\nGuess what you can actually have spoke to you kinda have something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs in hot equivalent and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about a thing that Mrs you none of the things that we didn't like and he was saying was she got to be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation but how much they says brinkmanship how much that is both sides kind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions of the two costs me ...\nI think some of it as brinkmanship I don't think that you feel like compromising by much cause that things will hang on a minute you know the people who votes to leave it you'll mess\nYou clear it up and clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions\nAn apology so I guess what's going to happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a guns in my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that puts off all those issues that we've been talking about just the more exactly will the future relationship be won't will happen with trade what will happen precisely\n... about the border so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos\nWill the future relationship be what will happen with trade what will happen precisely ... about the ball to so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union but all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship gonna ...\nThat'll get sort of kicked in and that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBut listen if they can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement then how life is it that that will come to a final settlement they'll come to\nThe the we get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that that will be able to actually find some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question and of course it's it's one in a way when when he was good at is what drives ... people really enthusiastic about ... crazy they thing hang on a minute ... this these talks transition could go on forever and ever\nBut it also ball those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union saint who think this is just looks like a recipe for kind of\nChaos ... Britain's soles of in the European Union but sort of know what's in it so now that ... prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just go back to the issue that these programs about the Irish border that is struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement for this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a sacrament in the in the longest I bought my assessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise\nLook it's an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at it for two years and of course\nYou know that the reason there's nowhere in the world whether ... whether to countries on and the customs union or in a way that even the u._k. are trying to do the impossible I suspect\nPlus conversations with artists conductors and composers joined me for performance today from American public media\nToday weekdays at one PM on a PR\nAlabama public radio service of the ...\nWeekdays at one PM on a PR\n\nThis is Alabama public radio service of the University of Alabama W.
