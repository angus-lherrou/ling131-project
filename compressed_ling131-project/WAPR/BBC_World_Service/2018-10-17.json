feed them\nShirt that that was ... and Italian it's interesting you mentioned choice but what show I think is also talking about is the culture is the information as well is that getting through\nThis is exactly the point that\nThe decision about when to have a baby is one of the most intimate decisions and many people are making this decision without preparation without access\nThere are over two hundred million women who would like to have the ability to plan their family as sorrow decided to do but\nDo they have access in the clinic or they welcomed a is the young girl in particular protected from having a baby too soon all of this implies that choice could change a life that could change the family and sharing your story shows us the benefits of being able to plan your family\nThe benefits of having I Would say uh all the supports including things like childcare including the ability for a girl to finish her education and the health system must be equipped to help women\nAll over the world to make these decisions what\nFor education and the health system must be equipped to help women\nAll over the world to make these decisions what\nWhat then what is the UN's ... proposing needs to happen what changed needs to happen in those coming years to be able to contain this\nAs we've said we're predicting an additional one point three billion people by the year twenty fifty if women cannot take the reins of their own fertility control whether one of them how often that they want to have a baby\nThe policies of governments\nThe uh nurses in the clinic everybody who uh deals with the question of wanting to delay pregnancy wanting to have safe sex these are things that we need to talk about more and we also have to deliver the services at the point where the woman can reached a the services achievement\nHowever what what you're talking about often you know Charlotte speaking but there are countries were women don't have the choice don't have the control over their bodies they don't have the control over when to marry one to have a child\nThere there's still a great deal of gender discrimination of depriving many women have the power of that choice\nThe heart of the matter is exactly the men and women are equal but women are the ones that are disadvantaged when choices taken out of their hands\nNot only the information but the services and the expectation that a girl should be able to fulfill her potential this is what the report is showing very clearly were falling back and we can't sit back and relax and things and things the job is done in that regard we need to bring\nContraception services understanding to young people in particular they're the ones who are not going to be able to reach the job market they're the ones who are not going to be able to fully participate in the economies of building up their country\nWhat do you think you're up against are you up against a cultural problem are up against resources or if you are you up against ... at the lack of dissemination of information in certain areas\nFor us at you and I have a fundamental things\nIs that women have rights and women and girls have to be able to

deals for all we have no forward it in those announced that between the north around in the south\nUm that that means they stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because

the online video game industry let speak to Ellie gets in video games journalist who joins us in the studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game for I'd I don't play but I've heard of it how was it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it well\nYou don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of dominoes again I think that was one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season politics about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in that sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season pilots and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon Lucas\nSo yes a brand new cars is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these are enabled prior to cheat basically he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim at them does it for you automatically\nSo he's been selling these molds to the game online\nAnd for a upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software or a Fortnite\nThat's right that basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says or not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think ... haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if you do this this is what the consequences will\nBe and it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nKnow if it's not even a fuss for food\nDo this this is what the consequences will be and is this tell us about the significance of this case is this

not without hope so just sent me take this week because everyone quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what\nIs happening is that took the continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawal agreement if\nYou like it still has to be completed on because I remember it isn't just the e you or\nMe as an Irish and meet the or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the British prime minister\nLast December signed

don't like what's on your paper for example but I'm going to propose changes I guess what you won't agree with all of them but you take someone bought\nThat has not happened in these negotiations what is happening on this is a troubling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k.\nSide on that is their right to do they have said well we don't like to withdraw we went on the other hand we're proposing that in the future relationship we'll agree to this if you like\nThat is their right to do they have said well we don't like what started we went to an all around we're proposing that in the

very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where\nYou'll the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect

Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry up maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now\nWhat I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market

and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to

meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and
