finding food nothing else we will have to survive on the ...\nTo see the future we'll have to survive you lost contact will happen\nIt was very difficult at some points and I decided to find a friend self might dodge way we used to go to a hung around with my dad so I went I left my bravo with them and I didn't tell them I have a plan to go somewhere else\nSo you was separated from your brother at the age of ...\nYou'll probably at the age of six yes he was to ... and up until very recently you haven't seen him again a tool you had no knowledge that he was still alive\nYeah um for some reason I had I had to hope I say he is strong enough you will survive if you know strong like the way I struggle he'll be day to because a little skewed died for hunger food and stuff like\nThat and yeah I Know there's been a miracle\nOf cause yeah it's hot enough to our ... eight nine nine to use and I look at him again it was kind of\nMiracle on him seeing may doesn't recognize me and said I don't know that guy\nHow do you know this is your brother um somebody just contacted me because I'm I was trying to stay away a lot of 'em on the social media and stuff but not post myself because when I I I'd be\nI got my professional contract football and a lot of people know about it and stop posting pictures I said when I was six years old I lost my ... this country and if anybody finding a mile give him this amount of money and stuff like that there is a these will be available and then there is so many people contact me for different kids\nAnd then finally there is one password and who may shed and my mother's name correctly so I said he might be the one so we arrange to do the DNA test and then we did it they can sense yeah he was confirmed\n... um it's\nI felt cold like Baric cold like up to inside my ... and it was cold and it was like okay\nThis is not true fast I didn't believe the second thing what I did is to get a flight the next day well we'll see he was a look at it in Uganda ... other strict keyed as well and he's not an issue to bring him to London\nYes she is the way from me and he's leaving with me now so it's like after all this time [noise]\nVery nice feelings like very very nice feeling this is the family that I was waiting for a long time\nAnd they've not even be living together for a week it was six days to get the um it moved in to it smells ... he was a truly inspirational young man up with me in the studio rubbed 'til age eight pay late and Ron I'm Michelle I'm Rob tell\nYou can probably identify with that story because you also learned undocumented immigrant I'm absolutely\nAbsolutely I left Liberia when I was six years old I'm moved to the United states to draw on my mother and my father and pretty much overstayed my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old so hearing that story what it really says to me is you know this sort of\nRacist than a phobic populist notions that uh migrants are um a purge on society that they are swarm who come in and feed off a system finite resources for those who are not documented\nUm who are documented I should say it's just complete mess um this young man is a is emblematic of the sheer resilience and the great and the hard work\nThat migrants put in a minute from come from very difficult circumstances not for me I left Liberia before the war started but as a result of the war I had to remain in the United states and my parents shielded me for almost fourteen years\nFrom that fourteen year armed conflict um and as a result of that my parents had to work exceedingly hard um to pay for very exorbitant immigration fees to send me to private schools because public schools as too much questions about my status\nUm and so I think listening to this story should make a lot of us rethink our notions about migrants whether they be documented or undocumented that they actually contribute meaningfully to society um and that many of them come through very safe orderly and regular manners\nYeah he is achieved so much I mean so much more than most people will achieve and the whole large already and unease barely getting started\nRun and what did you make it a type I thought I mean like ... it was an absolute inspiring story and in many ways very useful at this global moment when it seems that migration is almost always associated in news headlines with negative stories stories about\nThe exploitation or stories that migrants and the take away jobs from indigenous populations which of dislike self contradictory stories that come to be true at once\nAnd I think hearing it smells story mine just in fact we're not talking about a zero sum when migrants joined the community we're talking about a

[noise]\nI'm shining background can\nOn it [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is a song about corruption which ties in with your next book which is about corruption\nSure um so my first book titled ... was a an anti corruption children's book\nAnd the sequel ... which is coming out hopefully by the end of this year is about integrity so whereas the first book teach his children how not to be corrupt the second book jot it which means truthfulness honesty and integrity and my mother's bathroom language in Liberia\nI Want to know people were light it I remember being at the at the train station when they were coming in and people were applauding them as it came off the train but a lot of people really weren't very happy about it\nAnd so at it because of the politics of the main parties people have been moving over to seek other alternatives and you have people who are very unhappy about the immigration is she going to the far right\nParties ... very and on the immigration and on on the market one to ... and and [noise] and who are the there's the other alternative in Bavaria there's also another a spender party fun to see us you just hire they\nThey're not quite as as a radical has the um our state and a lot of people are going there but you also have people who in the middle who feel disenfranchised by the sea is you so they are also a they're going further left they've gone and massively to the greens and the greens actually signed in this election to be the big winners\nAre that are currently to Nineteen Eighteen Nineteen percent in the polls and they could be the second strongest party in Bavaria for the first time\nRunner I can really you want to jump ship I was just such a speaking to the moon friend in Germany a couple of days ago and she ... about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green both of you know your decision or the old foreign minister from ten years ago the rub the sort of ... this is the role of them will Roger cool fundamentalist starts with green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often difficult differently the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know there\nAnti racist I mean I and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance expect forty thousand people to turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nSo they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment you know pro was sort of a you know clean energy and and um they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country so I think a lot of people\nA lot of people are are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be in that those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd well it's because that migration has as since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nIs divided the way people think they're a lot of people don't want people coming in to people who are doing very well particularly pensioners this is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so they [noise] they're also worried about the loss of and their their sense of ... you know their culture\nAnd they're afraid at part of the thing that the ... say they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries and that this is a a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh the flavor and the car on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James ... from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows to sticking with the topic of immigration but the last speaker and that was George I do know founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she'll take on that\nI did I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more clan to sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nFor your attention to what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in class time forms of migration I'm an income\nUm and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to to to be more danger\nUm so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican was so\nYou know Republican so harsh about migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric that same race is sort of been a phobic rabbit rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I don't I don't know why this happened\nBecause you're you're right I've heard this perspective before why would someone with it you just saw an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to that kind of\nI think what's interesting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe have done a ... I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this us and us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the offenses you know there's this find not set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who looked like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have my ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way of the world's\nWrote them after your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue is immigration and China\nWill the really big issue there is no immigration in the sense of people from outside China coming in but internal migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build buildings were on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor ... China but those people will not properly documented they can't claim for welfare pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problems facing chimes today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nAs soon as we can from the b._b._c. World Service with me I like Fritz ... Germany's foot bowling side has continued they've lost free now to the Netherlands that six to eight and ten games I was that Ross joins me from ... how much pressure is that for a change of manager\nHow you ask a question of first defeats them Evelyn since Nineteen Ninety two first time ever that Germany have gone three games without scoring that bought some of the three team European nations league with to match is to go I'm facing a trip to world champions frogs snakes are\nGiven this all comes off of a finished Baltimore if that group of the world cup of coffee angry and very public interest\nAngry and very public international retirement of ... despite the fact that he's won the world cup and I can federations cop in his twelve years in charge manager Yogi love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVoluntarily just see if we thought it on the end you harden disappointing match to lose three nail in the first few minutes we have control and created a few chunks days\nI'll biggest problem is that we're not taking them the situations that was wedding training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see two goals at this level that shouldn't happen\nSo as an amount of hours and just the first thing\nThat was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualify as an ball boys to one way in in the Congo amount of gas goes one way and a white at equitable real guinea provided the shocks well my area and South Africa both both posted it very big wins\nThey put themselves in prime position now to be the two sides to qualify from groups\nPay and in tennis should we be surprised that Roger Federer his failed to make the final of the Shanghai\nAnd I think a lot of people will be surprised Roger Federer ever loses the match but it will just fast events since the U.S I've been a month ago so in that sense perhaps not but being in the semi final against the Twenty one year old who never reached a final Adam ... says have been the full federal was obviously going to be the favorite in the end up on a charge posted\nBy surprise six ... six full when he spoke to his final place against ... but federal though still happy with how he's performed in Shanghai\nI'm happy how the body is held this week I feel like I'm explosive out there I'm returning well and are serving the you know I think it's OK could be a little bit better um I don't think I played a match where I didn't get broken so that's something\nThat it's more unusual for me but um this week I felt like I was hitting the ball well and I think that's something that I can definitely take along with me\nOn that final charge against jock itch gets underway in around two hours type\nAlistair Ross thank you very much you're listening to weekends from the b._b._c. World Service more\nFrom my guests Ron I'm a professor of history and politics of Martin China and robbed till ... daily Liberia and also um academic on retro book about corruption the children this weekend from the b._b._c. World Service the news is next\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio\nRadio content eight PM American public media with support from see three I O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial intelligence audio tea and elastic cloud computing\nDon't get caught up in these huge amounts of money billions of dollars that go into ... you're taking a laundry or into a contract so one of the biggest of their schemes whereas in Latin America where billions of dollars were spent politicians rope told you you wanted\nTo come in here yeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples up because I mean although Transparency International has a corruption perception index with with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've got billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through\nYou know evading taxes through transfer pricing I'm mostly from Poland for multinationals and you have you know the the with the leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of a corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index\nWhich is more evidence base is more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tens fancy international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption in Africa and then the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that sorry I did meet John it you\nKnow I think one of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of the series of high profile arrest this time ... who was the head of into pole and they seem to be picked up at the airport in Beijing and now charged with bribery\nAn innocence what China's been doing particularly in the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national supervision commission is what you might call emptied transparency there's this huge crackdown but it's very much the product\nOf north ... state very little openness about what's going on and you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and just basically putting the frightened there's a large numbers of wealth people not just officials but movie stars even saying Chinese movie star who was\nA hidden away for three months until she came out in the ... tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go to\nCasey will from eyesight or I I think in part atmosphere [noise] Casey visit earned about ... can you hear me just try again yeah\nJust try again yeah Amnesty International called her or at the national supervision finishing the medic threat to human rights in China which we agree with that\nAnd people without trial without access to a lawyer for six months for having an organization that you can't appeal Ireland's record is probably not the way to go from ... I'm\nSorry I think a ... little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I I I suppose the question will review 'em and in fact roped till\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of United States the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty wild impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world do the work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there is a small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer uprising or less the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parent beyond just moving around the changing the practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in Sandy corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways of cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have announced that too that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with the lines of you have to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International but I thought of as a a newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption on a major scale by a movie star in China just tell me a ...\nIt's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie style roast celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and she said she disappeared in July reappeared on E. three months later and very mysterious circumstances with it\nSense as with the tax bill for a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost as high as the b._b._c. present the salary I Believe yeah but I ... [laughter] well of course but it's basically a sign that China is willing in this case to basically make examples of incredibly famous incredibly well and then people to give the idea that new but he remains on touch\nOf course many of these people one suspects that people who have fooled unfounded the Chinese leadership so it's by no means transparent but there is a sign out there in China at the moment the state of contagious wealth shutting off your wealth is no longer perhaps in session and that's linked with the anti corruption movement\nRupture lost on this point if you have to sum up in Sochi seconds we do have a lot of young listeners on the b._b._c. World Service war is still one point that if you're trying to say why not to be corrupt the young person what is the the most important thing\nI think corruption I'm Still the way from basic social services so what could be used for health care what could be used for education again to educate the next leaders\nAcross the globe um are use for their dubious means and so I think young people across the globe have a stake in ... in ensuring that their resources um are not squandered off by people who may be incredibly powerful who may be rich and wealthy already\nUm so we all have a a role to play in young people particularly can change the practice of corruption\nMuch more than they may be able to change the policies\nRupture run it will come back to you show three this is the b._b._c.

academic and run a metric professor of\nHistory and politics of Martin China and runner I go to copy of today's Sunday Times newspaper here with me and he writes about the corruption charges against the Interpol president in China [noise]\nRight and in many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and has now been put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader\nAnd his Communist Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together and that enabled\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the growth of alteration intelligence ... so\nThe state is using tech for surveillance in China much more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for a sort of surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards on on those not just the financial details or your I'm\nA criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China and this\nAnti corruption stories just one positive\nBecause I read an extraordinary thing on the news was yesterday and this was the the the the software that is in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to lower the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credit in other words if you do things that are not criminal but or in some ways against public morals could be crossing the road at the wrong place almost seriously of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up at the railway station you want to buy a rail ticket\nAnd you'll ID card says sorry you don't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger [noise]\nRob Jones you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much to do you see about this in the country is concerned\nWell it's raised bait citizenship causes so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm or formerly um slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former\nFrom the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have re citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nYou for coming into the weekend studio\nVigils are taking place in churches across El Salvador ahead of the ... late today all the mud archbishop Oscar Romero he was an outspoken advocates of peace who was shot in the head in Nineteen eighty or saying mass this is the report to\n... ... who was an eye witness\nI was sitting at the archbishop teach with my tape recorder that healthy now and then suddenly almost at the end of the time it was the sound like a huge explosion I saw him fall [noise]\nCampus that he thought people\nPeople were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him lying there leading such confusion no one knew what you do\nIs killers have never been brought to justice protected by an amnesty ... off of eight Nineteen Ninety to peace agreement I spoke to the American journalist Jean ... in South south at all\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... downtown where he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other is the little chapel\nOn the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is the why she sat important he\nWas the archbishop here in St Cloud or the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and\nHe was he was really be loved and\nRespected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military\nDictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing his life he was shot to death the day after he gave us Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically\nTo the members of the armed forces and saying to them you\nDo not have to obey and the moral order to go out and and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities who killed him\nWell it was for the most part\nPeople from on the government's thought the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out that there was a growing leftist movement\nHere it eventually grew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed\nIf you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you can count on him denouncing you for\nIt in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers have never been brought to justice why not\nFor a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere\nI couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that ends the law and\nActually this week in the room the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks it's really important that there be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them really to heal\nIs for the country to find out what the truth really was\nAbout his assassination and then for justice to be applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Colombo speaking to me from El Salvador [noise]\nI have a three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a planned statute of Manhattan a candy in Malawi ... commercial capital blanche off the ... muscle groups claim not only that the Indian independence or I did nothing for the southern African countries they accused him of being a racist\nJimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of Malawi and told me why he backed this cool\nGuy and they had more sick in Malawi has no connection to our country is really dealt in Africa and and the thing in the listener is would have been a few publications about questioning his stance on Africa Africa's arguing that he was one way or the other races\nYou heard a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but it's up perspective that much in recent years what do you see evidence somehow McGahn deep being a racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi mulatto has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and they are business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in ... as the Indian ... doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with Phyllis though that wind up in the community so from my perspective there's a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... and as you said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise]\nIs the point from in the gum and destructive is more or less like how they argued in\nGun away the gun in government was forced to take to start to get my to my gun from the rest of the argument that it's been sort of cardio relationship and has been good\nA diplomatic relations between that country in India the same argument that are being made in Malawi and here we're talking about his statue something that is going to stand in the middle or ...\nCommercial capital wouldn't it be a sign of tolerance if you want to have this statue build a sign up not always moved on\n... years you could argue from a respected but then when they begin to think about what a structure stunts was completely different thing by having it starts to discourage your trading future generation to generation that is somebody that I Do most of us ... it'd be\nSo if not Mahatma Gandhi who would you like to have a statue of\n... so it's different for me just you know one person but I think that would do a lot of studies for these shows for example were fired George ... who is one was a part of an formula struggling this country he had a British national did the\n... actually happen subtitled struggled people are struggling envy brings out maybe read much every country a lot of fuel to something but it wouldn't be looking for something\nTo be Kenya from the University of Malawi statues are a bunch of things on a I'm broke too\nAbsolutely I think what's interesting about this case is it really is it comes out of this outgrowth of a de colonization pan African his movement across the continent where people are looking at colonial structures\nBe they buildings or names of streets I'm fly the line just recently changes need to fly teeny to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the Rosemont fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it ... violence um whereas you know racist policies across the university\nNeeded to move that ah the statue of suffer road to the sinister colonialists I'm across the southern African region so I think\nIt it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academic spaces but also at national level rather you\nListening to that to what did you make of it well first of all the uh the the speakers what's that going to um campaign to have the name of the city a blind time change 'cause I think that's an alternate ditch his name down but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said the company has nothing to do with Africa in fact a cause for having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress across very ... with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that we've gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of ...\nIndependence movements the idea of mass known violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course not done they had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved completely ... that is when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how the ... developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect and gum has as much to say to Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\n[noise] it's interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each [noise]\nYeah I mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across ... how we are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yeah you're you're absolutely right that's that's the power perspective isn't it\nRonald ten seconds from you I Would say the statues of Mandela and gun they should be placed on around the world and ... to about\nThe final word run a ... a professor of history and politics of Martin China from Oxford University robbed tell me joy highly Liberian academic\nAnd all ... and author of a book on corruption for children as young as I thank you both for joining us in the studio here on the weekend program on the b._b._c. World Service fun to see more in the hours ahead here on this radio station\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer and distributor of award winning public radio contact eight PM American public media with support from T Rowe price\nAnxiety about home this is a question that I think will apply to look a lot of people and we could if we expanded we could include people wearing Nike shoes when they're about to go on to a football field and\nIt's like a domestic if it makes you feel less anxious this may be a positive thing for you anyway you might performed better on\nThe football field or your example the interview you feel like you've got something that brings you could look this is the question that gets me so what we have here at the ... of a man with pen in various ... at the multi\nThis faceless ... was collected in Malaysia in Eighteen Ninety six and looks every bit as disturbing as it sounds but brace yourself let's not as things are about to get even dog\nMaking of a sick and then facing with shock things very common and rituals to harm someone um this is why I think my magically and the question is could you stop the image of a loved one Russian I Know we all know that\nIt's fun to talk to him and it actually doesn't bet any real relationship to the living breathing pass\nOne question I think where it's yeah it's really stumped me I mean I ... I came in thinking you know I'm a rational amount of science degree I Know that there are these ... known as ... as a as a real bearing on the real physical well but actually I didn't ... myself to either\nPlan you know what else to to send it to face has yesterday you did yeah\nSo I think like me and I printed a couple of them out of\nYour mom and your brother's\nYou heard his ... yeah I just wonder you know just to see [noise]\nComfortable with you on Iona succumb to it I think it's similar to wishing it'll somebody you know you're not going to be able to actually change the lives of bring up something about by thinking about that but would you want to it's so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to just not do that\nYou don't have to ... trying to think about very common ritual magic and this is a role in national\nThing today and when you do and to not check 'em your least psychologically changing something in your house to the basement during it\nThanks to Sophie page and no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the mouse for that mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nEntered Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago University's School of business and an expert in magical thinking my way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs\nAre really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or a tribute to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nThink that they are\nOur building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example who are always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program and um there was a bit of the museum about voodoo and um but producing ovary cruelly brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was off to forward like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with the bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nSome places lots of the time and so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems\nAre in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air and what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nWant you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three chosen okay good now you can keep your ...\nOr you can swap it for the remaining to him but look what\nYou go full you should go for the two [laughter] there is no question you're rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up while about the same\nLike a really high number and so what you're saying there is a kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and an sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because just because of some kind of it\nSome kind of a rational belief that's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the food too so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition I see this is going to be really bad if I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid that and not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying it\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining at as a possibility Jane rise in that\nYou are listening to crowd science on the b._b._c. World Service the program the onset of your questions about life on the universe\nWe've heard from Jane about how all natural tendency of human beings to seek causal connections can help us to understand the whole world but can sometimes lead to a rational or false belief is that what's happening with list them also to help us all to that question is David Spiegel hope to an expert on come into it and says\n[noise] a dirty projectors [noise] live from here we make great radio\n\nThis is Alabama public radio service of the University of Alabama W.
