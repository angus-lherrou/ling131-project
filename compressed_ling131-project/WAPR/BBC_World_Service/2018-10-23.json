Andrew would our business present this morning I just coming up to twenty minutes past the out could scientists\nHave found a cure for drug resistant strain of tuberculosis new combination of drugs have successfully treated more than Ninety percent of patients who had this form of TB ...\nWhich is good news considering tuberculosis is the world's deadliest infectious disease last year it killed at least one of the ... million people around the world poker pulled up would you already it's from the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease\nStudying Baylor roost is significant because\nIt's a country with an extremely high burden of the most difficult forms of tuberculosis so we called extensively drug resistant tuberculosis or ex T. R. T. V.\nAnd that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis at one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the Jacqueline they were able to find that these very very difficult patients that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent\nIs one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis in the last fifty years so uh this is a ... at the big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this and it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug\nYou must have at least to effective drugs so just in developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\n... since about the only way to beat tuberculosis is to have one drug and combined with the others was does that mean it was simply a case of mixing a cult sounds together in the right way and then eventually you know ... bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about ... and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon you're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its forms\nWhy is ... from its points of view so successful\nTuberculosis is successful it it's an organism that can live in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never\nSocial tuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can live in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease all just like dormant in your body\nAnd some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak for example when you have HIV when you have diabetes or in other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers kidney disease that can actually make the organism\nCome alive again to actually develop to actually develop the D. disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to to rich countries is that correct\nI think that the tuberculosis is a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states or the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially in the middle income countries like South Africa China\nIndia needed the countries that have some of the highest Britain's of tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich country they're becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to spur a kilo says\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher\nSo that we can have the thinking but it's like putting fire on something where you're tuberculosis is common and now you're going to have diabetes adding fuel to that fire and I can see a a gross of the tuberculosis in somebody's especially middle income countries that quarter of the world's faces and it is in India\nOkay and then if they're at the obesity is going up there then you have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the background a level of tuberculosis very low even when you have obesity\nYou're not in diabetes in term it's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor the surface for countries like India South Africa China the prior so you will be to find somebody city would die we'd lifestyle and through that way you can be tuberculosis\nAnd that's one of the way that you were able to beat tuberculosis ultimately what you need for it to parochial hostess it to make sure that people are treated appropriately with the right a combination of drugs\n[noise] took to pull the food you are there from the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease telling us about discovery by scientists but to

there is one of the great cites a must see for tourists from around the world and in many African countries the abundance of wildlife brings in the visitor's hunch huge amounts of revenue but much of it is under threat\nIn addition to well known problems like poaching and logging a new study has revealed the menu for continents protected areas such as national parks ... underfunded Jenny middle of the University of California is a co will so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks require\nBetween one to two billion dollars annually in order to adequately protect lands but they receive only me about three hundred and eighty million dollars annually so that's just about ten to twenty percent of what's needed\nSocial fool or just to note ... protected areas ... billion dollars across the country\nThat's correct I'm not going to change anytime soon there's\nNo in fact it may get to be a higher number as lions continue to decline in the pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively\nUs twice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S football team like the Detroit Lions so for a relatively small cost we really can't save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parks\nIn the report you make the link a but if there isn't a major increase in funding that will be a decline in the population of loans that were you for your social norms why what's the link\nOh because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all the traffic levels below them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly through ecosystem benefits like clean water\nHealthy soils and so saving protected areas saving wildlife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut more some ... repeated this on the funding for parks is a long term problem and yet the lines of still look\nThat's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally about where now at a tipping point\nProblem and yet the lines were still look\nYes that's a good point um lions are very resilient species generally\nBut we're now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now there are species will continue to decline\nAnd so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly useful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystems\nWhat constitutes a tipping point now as opposed to five years ago ten years ago for\nLions have decreased about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where ecologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when a species reaches a certain point in their populations there's really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still enough independent populations that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus on that have good populations of lions that if we invest now we're\nGoing to prevent falling off the cliff\nAnother argument you made in the report is saying there's a case for investing development funding in protects in parks now if I'm In charge of advocates in lots of money for the vitamin on thinking first of all hell for roads and schools not better funding for park so how'd you make that case\nRight that is because a lot of people don't associate conservation with benefits to people and so they tend to invest in human focused development like infrastructure\nLike education but really investment in parks with wildlife is investment in people because of the benefits to ecosystem on human health but also tourism so it's important to realize that the wildlife watching industry in sub Saharan Africa generates an estimated thirty four billion dollars annually prism\nMore broadly has created six million jobs so when you're investing in wildlife you really are investing and people\nWill choose my strong goat

I'm a business person\nSecond to last me quit to put in but we're not pitching while cutting an idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach it I can feel it I Do everything from the way you

miss it ... you know you asked yeah you don't even have the lyrics anymore you just\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you can probably sometimes you get a truck and I like can you get a treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market\nYeah you know so that's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market or maybe I'm just not as popular as director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly but more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talked to said he directors or twenty directors have many imaging and ours\nI recently pitched on the cot is a Beyonce and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and I knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in a busy schedule I'm not sure that had time to talk to\nHer I just have to come up with an idea and like heart for the best you know I didn't quite know at that time but not support a band director that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success to show\nThat maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artists and you ... out of it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIs the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale I didn't have the opportunity to watching of course with some amazing art is but then I think I'm looking by the time to come to me that kind of made up their mind but then then again it's not genes look beyond say\nYou're listening to the conversation ... to ... music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you booth operating at a level where many of the office he worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think can be a specific examples where you had to navigate accommodating to ... holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody wanting something a little bit differently so just in does make you\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way 'cause I mean I have to put myself especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course drops going to medical than male dominated field I'm not the added cross all starting off\nOn television so I was putting the person that now want it to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity to knock it off the park\nNeeded to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did well official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony at I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that\nAnd I mean I'm not just one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept of tribe can be as visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he ... it was like actually love this treatment can I bite off your like that's the I call it that is one\nAnd I needed to make a decision I pointed out that you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better deal because of course you're going to have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that chalk eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heaven forbid that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more goods the tuition but that is the only project and I had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business cards universe and a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it just be the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nOkay can we talk about how much you're

horizontal line about ten centimeters along with a pair of few inches in front of my left\nSome quite cool and good fun to laugh but I'm Wondering how they help people who have freezing of gate happy so\nYes so behind the solution is not just sneeze she works closely with professor ... blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and in your own adjust\nThe essence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called automatic pilot\nIs defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that automatic ability is lost in people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by by policy that automatic pilot which is more or less discharge engine of the brain by consciously\nRecruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the lasers basically do is offer an external visual trigger forcing or allowing to patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the loser\nDuring the visual trigger forcing or allowing to patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam and in doing so they ... they are defective automatic pointed\nRight okay I think I get that for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted is damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way or another\nReally good way to think about it is generally Parkinson's patients don't have any issues boot camp style as such because the staff going up ... as a visual cue or obstruction by\n... to ... the sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks the brain by constantly placing a cue and from out who as we heard a bit earlier has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets ... stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without she's on\nYou know can I can manage to says okay and then I get to the corner of the kitchen and I find it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet moving so I Will have to pulling my leg some holding like putting it around the corner for dragging myself along the the unit\nAnd then I get to the capital and I can't stand up straight to fill us in the capital and I'm guessing from the capital to this the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting and then to have to going to get in the milk when I've forgotten to take it with me\nIt's all said the same with the shoes on it still hard what but it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible [noise]\n\nSounds like the navy and she's asking than have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go to places like the supermarket with the knowledge that she can get out of a freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen however there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without warning\nSometimes on the cross quite badly and I I can I Can't predict when that's going to be there's nothing I can do except wait for the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and her by she called move on call ... the mom and she says there are other limitations as well\nEven if she's got the shoes and by ... move comp put them on and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside quite often if I'm On an uneven Seth is like the ground so that kinda fits in Haiti place and that's the surface is flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that\nI imagine a calm the very easy to see delays is on a sunny day\nYeah mounted mentioned to me that when she goes in ... in a field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she can't really see lasers on one of the drawbacks and she felt or independents on a peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible lump does\nSo it's not a passing solution from out buddy help so do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\n... study was done and it showed the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants of medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was a decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size early Nineteen participants in our study\nYeah that's ... and I wonder how do these you know do they make you send out do you do a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the uh the motives of this why someone in the Netherlands ... on a train and it caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon uh from what I understand what puff have rarely\nRefined products and son to address some of those concerns but it is who is going to generate tension wearing ... she's in public and I chose attention to something\nPeople might otherwise wants to be quite private about\n[noise]\nSo these two ideas don't pull and lays issues [noise] both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently than my own way we can treat the brain fall out of the ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area what's happening as wearable tech startups like top on laser shoes\nA kind of tracking you're a scientist or labs and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker previously they would have been but among the lab for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist\nAnd but among the lobby for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of stops and you're a scientist and professors and you are scientists who have been speaking to you have said this very lucky we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future [noise]\n\nThis fascinating thank you I'm ah and things to all of you for listening to all tax if you went to see those lazy she's an action go to

more instability dot com slash wealth stability brokerage services L L C\nUse all the time and we just decided to publish a list of all those companies for transparency the public deserves to know which companies are\nSupporting the gun lobby and I think because there was so much pressure and attention on the n._r._a. in that week after the Parkland shooting very quickly those companies started getting a lot of pushback and very quickly pulled their relationships with the IRA\nWhich was something that we haven't really seen before and I think it was pretty shocking and new and surreal for people to see that\nYou could chip away at some of that are as power\nDid we see any of the major retailers pulling back from the sale of forums for example\nThere were a number of major sporting goods stores that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they wouldn't no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention is there any\nDelta Airlines and United Airlines told I say would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact the n._r._a. finances we know that they are\nComplaining of financial world court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails but I think one interesting effects of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the n._r._a. spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty fourteen mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the end All right for the ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed to get any formal comment from most of those companies have withdrawn from that support for the n._r._a. but we did reach one kind of a base for them that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment ...\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was stalking some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and to us that had some fifty thousand signatures on it but what we were really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what we were seeing and what we found him primarily in our social media channels\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and really trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision the the vendors that were impacted were long\nKenyan vendors are bows whose ethics were posted two hours then ... the holding company\nSo they were very real people um that I was lying to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nSo they were very real people um that I was in line to us and it would've been impacted by our decisions\nRight so it would mean a centrally with the prime movie made right was to to to stop selling on your shelves products made by this vista outdoor ... which was you would not selling firearms or ammunition yourself\nMr out during the manufacture of those things so you you basically cut them off as part of your offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey got it up for sale I don't think it's being sold yet\nI'm just making the observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this from the ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S and his formal politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but profess above spit it doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway\nThe key thing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money\nSo much as it has been the zealous loyalty of its base of gun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend the meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call I tend to demonstration when most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example\nThe n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities in the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the un arrays fine and swimming alone despite its claims of publicity\nWell and the entering does have money problems they spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle they gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump\nThey contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on in the American media in recent months\nHave money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reported on in the American media in recent months and their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household and to have at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than\nEight so let's hear from the rich and Mary Wilcox on too long

are actually starting to get to be a problem because there's too many of them\nMight pistols there that's a forty caliber and this one here with my great grandfather's gun purchase in Eighteen Ninety it's more of a buffalo gun for shooting buys in\nEach cell excited when he comes home and the deer and it's really neat what we can have for dinner as a result of that it's just amazing\nAnd especially like venison with here it's very very low cholesterol\nBecause they're wild animals do not like a cow that's eating grass not doing anything all day long I in my lifetime member of the n._r._a. I've been a member of the an array for Thirty years they support you a hunting accident or somebody breaks into your house and you shoot them you know legal fees\nThey just had somebody just recently just shot somebody in their home in the area of like a burglary yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my pistol all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun and gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that\nAnd if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns\nLike Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country\nI can do that and if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns like Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control it's like you guys for how'd you guys see that's\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem it's a mental health problem education problem it's\nSociety's problem I mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you go to school to be guns in hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks\nThey hid shooting classes in school nobody got shot like they did okay nothing it it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem so if you agree or they're going to outlaw guns the only ones are going to have guns are outlaws\nThey're making criminals out of every day people I mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns in controlling who has them but you can't\nYou can't just blame blatantly say no nobody can have them\n... because then you're going to end up with just bad guys having guns\nRich and Mary Wilcox from a town called water for the New York state well they may be a golf as all the new anti gun measures that they're seeing but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to care Linda fink progress\nThis is a critical midterm election this year and I think we have candidates running this year specifically on a platform of gotten safety and we have a candidate outside of choice I named Lucy McBath\nWhose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed and Florida number of years ago and this year after Parkland she decided you know what if I Want a candidate who's going to support the type of gun reforms that I Do it should just be me and she is now the only one and we see candidates like this across the country\nFive AM right here on a PR for more information about this program me go to our website at W.
