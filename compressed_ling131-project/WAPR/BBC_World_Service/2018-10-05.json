prevention of chemical weapons\nAre and that was a an ... an attack for which for a Russian agents legit agents of military intelligence were expelled from the country because they were traveling\nOn diplomatic passport now as you said Russia's response has been to dismiss all the claims and that's been a pretty brown dismissal on all sides sites or the the foreign ministry here for example is accusing the west of a stage manage propaganda campaign against Moscow\nAnd it saying that the west is paranoid at Syracuse in Russia is accusing the west of spy mania and saying that anyone with\nA mobile phone is now being accused of being spies are really playing down or the the case against Russia ... playing down particularly the evidence will do we know for a fact that some of the evidence for example presented in the Hague about these Russian a man accused of this attempted attack\nA we know that to to if the men with ... to someone else if need linked to a military sites here in Moscow and also the taxi receipts that were presented as evidence one of them and took a taxi from a military facility to the apple a couple of days ahead of the attack\nI've called the taxi company they've told me that is a genuine receipts it was one of the drivers who made the trip on there is no no reason to doubt the authenticity if that were seats that suggests a quite a quite extraordinary a skill level of work by these Russian Spies\nAnd the idea of the slump the ah the sloppy were from the spies are I mean will it to be the Russians are generally fairly proud of their intelligence services are they getting a sense is there a feeling that maybe a that go I haven't been up to the usual standards\nWell not if you watch state media and also if you ... if\nState media nuts if you

that\nUh he recently hosted the Chinese President in Russia that the Austrian chancellor was here\nAre just yesterday so at talk of Russia's isolated in a ... a prize states I think it doesn't doesn't really feel like that here but certainly I think Russia is worried about what the consequences like they have all these accusations and whether the accusations made ... translates into the sanctions and for the economic harm\nTo Russia I think that is something that Russia is concerned about less about humiliation and being a pariah state but more worried about the practical implications\nSat

have done the wreck or several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that the I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman since\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major league towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the field to credits yes so\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on how\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe green ... the new region hydro power in the region hundred power is one tenth the energy or what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from ... it will be other countries will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and I'm just relaxing sit sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced him\nCarry this cascade not to view this shed by much of the Norwegian public that actually ... does is we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground\nAnd where the good guys and all of us I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfill funeral in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense should the new region government be grunting new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... see in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe it's sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will be still be producing in twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate gets submissions can Goodman says well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal indoor\nIn the work but it does not oil we're talking about well yeah but my point is that if you have replaced coal plants with for example of gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refreshed has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then to drain in the ... seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have lung cancer and others can argue that gospel replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy we've had over a hundred and fifty exploration in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on acceptable and find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good to\nUh would look at the time frame because clearly but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I eat a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big\nBig job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich and say let's start with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nGay or at the same time we have to address these yes and it's easy you because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut now we don't have which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another new regions they construct them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are kind of you wants to\nConnect with and she's yet this definitely important and we are in that situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... it's just like say yes what we need cash or sorry and it's essentially\nThe idea that you can somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or\nUnder the ... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting governments have spent quite a lot with a lot of money to try to make that happen there is\nGetting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on in Norway for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians say with a greater than it gets I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less than what you think the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC dull capital U.

with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think this kind of way so creating viable energy future is is really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and if you think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with\nThat we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way it can be a model for anybody else\nI think that we should sign certain ... certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy secure it is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issues we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in the room so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can for other than oil\nYou can for other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan come into fault none of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the er and the American I'm a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the American sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made it out there I Know but it's ... it it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listened to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and it's happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speed\nOf of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that renewable energy will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exploiting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new reached gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an older guys on board ducked terminal comes from the barn she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes ended\nAnd the security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies playing some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that the way the counterweight to lead powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nIn the air and sea have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard and the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily good that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou're ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe I guess we'll exclude cold\nLifted quarter lay on what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe um the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables\nThat he's still a ... to ... to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve impressing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd since renewable energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time in a way already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty states and Europe is committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nSo that's the picture that we're looking at I won't touch a little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with\nNew way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats citizens fed the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of the state says his new way\nAfraid to have some some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a welfare state before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or to have this the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and\nThank God we didn't have an ability we we have again it's areas aside in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective that's had an incentive is supposed to keep in moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the tens yes afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nBut we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\nBut I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nJoined me for performance today from American public media\nPerformance today
