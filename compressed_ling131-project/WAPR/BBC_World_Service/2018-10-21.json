Union agreed to eliminate nuclear on conventional missiles with a range of five hundred\nTo five and a half thousand kilometers but in recent years Russia has been accused of reaching the agreement by developing a new cruise missile which would allow it to launch a nuclear strike a very short notice\nBut in recent years Russia has been accused of breaching the agreement by developing new cruise missile which would allow it to launch a nuclear strike a very short notice President Obama considered withdrawing from the treaty but was apparently persuaded not to buy European leaders now Donald

not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement [noise] I go out and weapons\nWere not allowed to wear the ones that have said in the agreement we bonded agreement for Russia it's not hard to miss so we're going to terminate bravery what kind of all out\nIn response to Russia's foreign ministry was quoted as saying the U.S decision was made debated by the dream of a single global superpower but President Trump also pointed to China which isn't bound by the treaty for more on what it means I spoke to ... in Washington\nThe ... treaty was a very big deal when it was signed back in Nineteen eighty seven it was signed by Ronald Reagan on ... on basically it led to the elimination of hundreds of missiles from both of us I'm from Russia and it was one of those moments during the Cold War when people felt\nThe relationships were really improving hardly ever it has to be said over the last few years there being real concerns in Washington but the Kremlin had been ignoring this particularly with one cruise missile that they have been testing and the deploying\nAnd they've been trying to put pressure on Russia to try to hear to destroy say\nAnd it seems like patience is real night\nPresident Trump saying very clearly that they are not going to withdraw from this tree the unilaterally and not probably will not be accepted with a great deal of heart by some within the international community they feel that this treaty still has some value and therefore there will be some concerns that Americans decided to get rid of but\nHe also mentioned China and he said the U.S is going to have to start developing the weapons that were previously banned by this treaty\nAnd that is probably the worry in a in a sentence because the truth is is a worry for other countries and I suspect many within Europe for example\nHe said this could potentially lead to a norms rational some description but the U.S has felt for some time not when Russia has been ignoring this there was no pressure coming in from other countries like Europe\nTo tell Russia you need to abide by it\nTime not when Russia has been ignoring this there is no be pressured coming in from other countries like

would understand this ... well I think that hasn't quite what hasn't been yet as some massive decisive a public shift against Brexit I mean it's true that the opinion polls\nConsistently suggests that most people think that the government is amazing thing making them most of my team is that they are in a shambles as a social with of chaos\nBut I think what you clearly have an added I'll be

that right it's not and I thought well that's the problem is your daddy\nLook I think the the my worry is that the sort of simplistic tools that we have to decide on on these massive questions you know a referendum that simply involves a yes or no or even an opinion poll that says do you regret the division isn't going to give us the sort of nuance and there was a fascinating piece of research commissioned by kings College London recently which\nTested various options and ask people to you know with all the nuances of the relationship with Europe on our people to rank them and make trade offs\nAnd what you get to is the single largest group of ... in Britain want her relationship with Europe that resemble something like the European economic association now unfortunately none of that

debate led learn policy making and so I went back to\nA very divisive simplistic yes no type model or when it comes to the public posturing and many of our political leaders and and\nI think most

now does that mean that she's safe I\nAbsolutely no I mean the the whole thing and and the newspapers the Sunday Times and others about ... and the conservative policy it's true it's it's not fake\n... and the people that you were witnessing marching yesterday in due to Rhode Island as well they ultimately want another vote or are they are they ... I mean shot me a coal swear by that could happen\nI think the calls for that is that the talks break down between the European Union and the u._k. a parliament than rejects the idea of Britain just crashing out without to deal with the parliament's con agree on what should happen next in which case over the years people have written\nA quick final salt cannot happen Danny ...\nAgree on what should happen next in which case over to you people have written\nA quick final sold cannot happen Denny ...\nOr it can happen and of course one of the most interesting between us is is that if you look at the demographics of how Britain is changing the to counter the pollsters estimated every day the remain vote in ... terms grows by a thousand\nBecause older people who have tended to vote for breakfast that have died off and younger people tend to remain um have voting so just the demography as time goes on suggested there'll be more of a remains in\nThe world yeah canister Campbell tells me on friday at one point five million people have died since he died in ... and ...

happens that\nUm and and you're covering it from that in science say they're yes it's it's much more of a sketch and I'm not quite fun to write but it doesn't mean oversee you're trying to follow him

withdraw from a key nuclear weapons treaty with Russia he said Moscow had repeatedly violated the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nWhile America had audited Russia has denied those US claims so who's right President Trump or the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that's a U.S based known parties on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nThe United states beginning in two dozen fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred

investment fund to boast about a hundred and Ninety billion dollars of assets and the management that they have an presumably that's the game in money talks and with so many people how many countries desperate for an investment the Saudis have surplus money\nAbsolutely one of these investments and you look at the trade between for example of Britain and Saudi this full point two billion or ... pounds of of of five billion dollars of of annual trade ... at the trade balance as much in favor of the u._k.\nSo that translates into about a hundred thousand jobs in the u._k. as a result of trade with Saudi are we prepared to give this up an roasted price rose means\nWell one of the things they love Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate night or other like set we have I laid out yeah I mean at somebody like in debt at Stanford a midlife crisis leaving leaving that reliable and ... now\nAnd getting in finding to the old days out there and more dangerous friends and I think um willingness to ... come on to that we say the ... of leaving the biggest market in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean it to the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a wrong or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is different set of values than we in the west operate\nOn what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things will\nMurder is always gruesome regardless of how he takes face um and I think the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping dripping information and then saying don't don't take this ... authorized leaks\nSo important to look at a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was a as a Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials\nAnd on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation by the Saudis and how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course they remember that when we knew it happening in Yemen they will still gathering at very happening what what what do you think about that\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it's it's not the subject is operating there it's Iran with who says if the straits of of um of my rape in the south is rich\nIt's not every subject that's operating the ritzy around with who says if the straits of of um of rape in the south of the red sea all closed up Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through those traits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through the it's it's ... you know you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news on the Iranians close the straits it's often the west who would be having to pay the price for it one\nOf the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is the sort of fragile and complex geopolitical settlement in the middle east what would happen if the west actually took the bold step of not propping up the Saudi regime\nWhat I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of false us and we're still dealing with that I think it'd be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not only Sunni extremists who wouldn't exploit this but to cheer extremist and and and you you have and then you've got the oil um we have to be a political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much

United states throughout the primaries and caucuses I'm In various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day means that I felt was worse\n... and caucuses 'em and various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and then do the song and we'd get laughs in some places in other places we'd get like an angry years but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable\nAnd different from any that you experienced before a\nLittle bit I mean the fact that the news\nInvades our lives in a way that it didn't few years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if some of this stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and\nSimultaneously Larry climbed who I've worked with many times over the years and had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing

with it but if they don't necessarily agree with the sentiments it gets more difficult\n[noise] yeah but I think even beyond that it's just not artistic to stand up and say you know here's what I think and you should agree with me and if I keep yelling at you because I've got the stage you know I've got the podium because he ... paid to come and see the show or whatever it is that that gave you\nThis audience it's so presumptuous to think that people want to be told what's right but it's\nFar more artistic to ask a question and it's more\nFair and it's just more right oh birds they\nAt

of\nFinancial ruin that might have just happened by accident you don't really know [noise] so yeah these are all stories that I think are relevant to the ... my experience of America is and their stories that I I think I intended\nTo at least for the most part said hey let's let's talk about this and um\nYou know the song and some wasn't the starting point but it ended up being the

on to that place I mean we're looking at the limits of human endurance and potentially long distance running we all know that we can't run long distances it off fast as possible sprint pace how come up ... let us do that\nWhat we have in the body is essentially two systems of energy delivery so we have aerobic metabolism which is using molecular oxygen from the atmosphere we didn't have any robot

hundred and twenty minutes\nAnd the reason the ... because you channel supply energy rapidly enough using a robotic system aerobic metabolism is quite slow where's Arabic metabolism is extremely fast you know your classic and aerobic events of the hundred meters two hundred me just four hundred meters\nAnything above that it's the aerobic system the predominant\nIs there a speed limit or to the

really common for a change or into late mainly the stuff at stomach hurt and when I re thing\nAnd this and that was specifically wondering if it was a good idea to cut down to one meal a day to reduce the pressure on her digestive system\nNut than it you know eating more meat a day ... gang the have you any when they meet the new nutritional clemency your body needs to the full at that level\nSo how do you get the right balance between each enough to a few yourself whilst avoiding putting unnecessary stress from your digestive system\nSay stressful it's about making sure that the each of the
