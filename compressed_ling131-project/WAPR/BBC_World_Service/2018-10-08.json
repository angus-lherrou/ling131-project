[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNo that's quite all\nLast week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his mobiles was suggesting we were heading for some of it\nRobert comma let me issue me a ... because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season and that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an oceanic heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical and sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before foreign ... made landfall ... raised with scale fool wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increase due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great to likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious\nSeries how in the ... tradition you could pinned down specific coaching changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast with our climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on western atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still fall out in the Atlantic\nLarge part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms and that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold little ...\nOn the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic book potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is

sort of intrigued with repelled but are you feeding\n'em I it's definitely there\nThere's no doubt that we all like a good murder mystery and if people are going to be scared by crime I draw the they were scared by true crimes done by obsolete an author fictional crime that makes things totally unbelievable\nSo in your view is important if you were talking about how a ball they can be dismembered you think it's important to get the details of how difficult it will is because there's so few people will\nEver become a member and for the chances that what I'm doing is educating them is extremely

saw your shrunken dead father did you feel that his soul\nAt my father owned by that point my father had been over leaving the soul that so I guess you know because if something happens in something change I was there I held his hands\nWhen he took his last breath in life and I felt there was nothing more than I could have done in front of the dolls and that it was the most privileged place that I could ever has been and it was such a gentle process for him that he decided he had enough he stopped drinking he stopped eating he turned his face of the wall and he decided he was going to die\nAnd when he took that that last breath and ... told that you hear when they talk about the death rental it's pretty much the fluid that goes into the lungs that comes out with a last breath\nThan I knew he'd gone and I had no trouble leaving my father's body but I Would never have left my father is still alive and in the last breath\nSomething changed but my father ceased to be on the boat he that was left with not my father it was just a vessel that he occupied for his entire life my father had gone he had\nHad gone he had died is there something beyond\nI don't know until they get their

Would say that in the past Twenty years is probably the most significant scientific report on the impacts of climate change that we ... that we've seen it's it's it's comprehensive it's I suppose the irony is that the closest that people get to see the problem the more clearly they can see and I think that\nThey would say that that'd be with one degree of warming in the world we're seeing more of the impacts and therefore it's easier to get the science to look at one point five and two degrees a that was say Twenty years ago so yeah the most significant one in the in the last Twenty years I was there\nA way to see the information in the report come from have they put this together\nYeah basically what they've done is they've looked at all the underlying science on the variety of impacts the potential for cutting back on a mission\nFor the whole range of scientific papers published in the last number of years some six thousand papers they looked at\nThe distilled down into a reporter
