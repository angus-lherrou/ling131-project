entire world economy\nAnd the image that most of the leaders had in mind was that we might be entering another Great Depression I think in a way they're panic was over done to actually because\nReacting to panic by more panic is not necessarily the right way to do with the Franklin Roosevelt had a different idea\nOn march fourth Nineteen thirty three when he said\nThat's the way\nThe fear was absolutely palpable and this was a crisis that started at the heart of world capitalism on Wall street itself so that made it even more frightening because Wall Street are not very frightened when terrible things happen to poor people but they're very frightened when bad things happen to rich people\nThe extraordinary thing about the financial crisis is that had happened in

specifically banks and others or such as if they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and the equity and the firms\nI still do not fully understand why it happened\nThat all the central bankers and national and international institutions allowed this to happen and didn't see the crisis coming troubles me deeply Martin Wolf is chief economics commentator at the Financial Times\nThere's no doubt of financial institutions and that regulates has made in retrospect enormous mistakes it's obscene no doubt about it and I don't think any of them would seriously denied\nAs ... what they were doing was perfectly legal and so the regulations and laws as much as the people are to blame\nI think there are two so says things that we have to think about\nI'm pretty sure that must've been things going on here which will a fraudulent too close to it but the truth is and this is I think really frightening thing\nThat most of it was legal in a way what was frightening about it is that we could get into such a terrible mess\nWhen people were doing things that can be very risky\nBut taking risk is not illegal taking risk ... ... the financial institutions of that full so you could say and I think I Would say that the real problem was that what was passed the legal turned out to be spectacularly dangerous\nThe financial crisis was the first crisis to highlight the

residents refused to go what will happen will they go ahead and bulldoze their spinach\nThey'll bulldozed the village and forcibly displaced a presumably the residents to different location or\nYou just remind us so why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's as simple planning issue which you know sounds innocent enough but there's two other issues that place here and one is that we're talking about occupied territory\nAnd according to human rights groups of the Palestinian authority's and uh most world leaders forcibly displaced saying they're protected population in occupied territory is anything from a war crime to a grave for each of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important\nUm it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements coming to replace them where there's already settlements their\nExisting there are many people say that it would it would cut the west bank into two different pieces I'm making a contiguous territory impossible should we ever see some sort of peace Dale ... and it would also cut off East Jerusalem which many people a ...\nOf the Palestinians and much of the world believe to be a will be the capital of the of

government said the structures we built on state owned land without Pam it's from the Israeli miniature he which undid the Nineteen Ninety three also call it's has extensive control over construction in sixty percent of the west bank known as Area C suggests this fall within ...\nIt does the residents claim that it's actually privately owned land owned by a a nearby Palestinian town\nUh but the other thing you have to understand about Area C and and there's really control there is that the Israeli military which is responsible for approving a building permits and in that area that you mentioned denies\nWell over Ninety percent of Palestinian requests for building permits and the residents of one of the smart one of their their last ditch attempts to stave off this this demolition was to submit a their own planning\nAnd their own master plan for for normalizing the the the the building permits of of their village and something that Israeli government allows settlers Jewish Israeli settlers to do when when they're caught building a what the Israeli government that describes says go ahead\nMichael surely the Israeli government then has offered them an alternative place to go to despite a international objection to this has been an alternative pacing where would that be then\nThere is it's a a location not too far away um\nIt's a girl so very close to a trash dumped a which is you can imagine is not as not ideal for this for this residents and the other the other problem they have with it is but it's it would presumably stop them from a continuing their\nUh their lifestyle which involves are hurting and another agrarian aspects\nOkay and it has become an international issue we said there's been a note of international objection to this including the un advised against it but Israel has not and\nNascent has gone to head with the ... what's likely to happen if this should go ahead\nYou know the Israeli government has been trying to to sort of take over this area and removes the Palestinian population for a few decades now and up until the Trump Administration the Americans and the rest of the world have essentially told the Israeli government do not do this ...\nAnd now there's there's very little resistance um the European Parliament\nParliament orange that it would be a grave Richard international law uh last year the many European countries want

far\nAnd that number's expected to continue going up because we were dealing with a bottleneck right now where unaccompanied minors continue to come into the country but they're not being released as

of the government is doing\nThe best way to understand it as this you know\nMigration flows into the United states they fluctuate constantly but in the last several years they've more or less stayed at the same level ... have changed since President Trump came into office\nBut what's different is that in the past unaccompanied minors were matched with sponsors that's usually family members or friends who've come forward once they come to the United states and agreed to sponsor them and take them and take them home\nBut the Trump Administration has changed you know both policies and rhetoric in a way that it really intimidated people out of coming forward to sponsor kid because they are afraid themselves of getting caught up in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement agenda because the vast majority of of adults who sponsor these kids and take them in our undocumented immigrants\nMostly been hearing stories about how the children to be moving into being away from

reach the last minute agreement on preserving a free trade deal that covers North America President Trump campaigned on a promise to revamp the existing deal saying it's a lead to job losses business presents a rope young is here uh so what's new in this\nAll over the past quarter century trade between the U.S Canada and Mexico has been governed by NAFTA the north American free trade agreement

agreement\nWill result in free markets beret trade and rip off the economic growth in the region but Canada has had to get into some American demands dumped him and he joins of trade experts at all to the university\nTold me that Canada has negotiated hard on prevented us from getting everything that it wanted\nThe Canadian team has done very well and it's like I said it pretty hard and read correctly\nCorrectly the constraint on Donald Trump that actually posed by his own Congress and the U.S business I'm so his threat was that it kind of didn't it you know it's kind of it wasn't going to play pool he would go ahead with a bilateral agreement with just the United states and Mexico\nBut the reality ones he would have struggled to get through that through the U.S Congress and they would've been a huge amount of pressure on him against such a bilateral deal that that's kind of out coming from his own business people that was sort of not really a pretty credible threat and the Canadians understood that\nCanada has had to allow us farmers more access to a ... kid and this was a big sticking point ... wouldn't do this Tuesday's potential you'll try element to this deal for Canada\nSo it's very early hours we're really in the very we haven't seen the details of the tax my understanding is that what they what the Canadians have agreed it's only a tiny bit more than they already agreed back in the days of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement\nI'm so back then they promised um the members of the TPP which included the United states of course access to that very markets by opening up a little bit over three percent of the dairy market\nAnd my understanding is I haven't seen the tax yet but my understanding is that they've been a tiny bit more than that but this isn't it's nowhere near the radical overhaul and opening up of the Canadian dairy fact that the u._s. was was aiming for it to stop the talks\nOn the other thing that's very important to recognize is that Canada has been very successful we understand again it's ... days but um we understand in preserving that what's called the dispute tackling mechanism chapter Nineteen of the original NAFTA which again us wanted to water down so it does seem that candidates sort of helps them on that\nStory comes always said that when it came to doing trade deals and he said he would renegotiate an awful lot of them after being at the top of the lists but it would be America First and other countries said they would do deals with the U.S it was when when with all this show that Trump's way of doing trade does she work because it is the world's biggest economies\nAnd of course if you're younger you haven't had the chance to know that\nAnd we also people who are older to look back and we all them when they with low near civil they said it was also when they were young adults so I don't think it's something about ... life I think this may ways of being the case it was just never measured before may be used as a time when you feel more lonely and that's interesting because there's going to ask\nAbout social media but you said older people have felt lonely and when they were younger but Britain is the lonely loneliness capital of your why is that what does it tell us about the culture here because I'll tell you what what what it locks in in in London and the surrounding areas then he'll be make eye contact and that in itself can be quite low in the right\nYeah so we did all these people will if it was about their neighborhoods and and whether they would talk to people and it was interesting looking because we have people from all over the world type part and in in nine countries in particular we were able to do more detailed comparisons and that we found that um the the UK and then\nThe the UK and then and I'm from some of us have kind of comfortable uh levels of letting us and India there was a bit lower in New Zealand which was interesting and we also looked in in terms of bigger regions we looked at a which countries\nAre places where people really value that independence and northern Europe is a place that would very much be the case and they had higher levels of lending us in the countries where people were very independent than in the places where people tend to depend on each other ... and be happy just depend on each other\nSo being independent does not necessarily a good thing now the prime minister any this year to set up punching levy aid loneliness and social isolation with a warning that millions of people were

La Nina setting much in the twenty eighth team was going to be a coma every year has some extremes willed is a big place after all but so many my ... be that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nUniversity it wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks shocks gr off puffing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least nine among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages or any parts of the climate story and know the ... that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase in\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless Oslo to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen every yeah\nAll right let me think what is not necessarily\nIt's not necessarily harming our what town which is I think the reason why do you think is often Maher\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that they used to be\nQuite rare and is now ready to call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here it's of heat heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time the warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael mind\nIs getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter in southern Cal\nSouthern California only this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo\nProvide for our

the problems facing the European Union because frankly of a democratic deficit west so why don't they don't recognize legitimacy I mean you institution but hey you let me I'm Out we being some sort of a global institution that says something some currency who who is this week\nWe let let me ask the question\nIn may to seizing Nineteen our movement is going to stand or the European Parliament

and you're going to walk the walk as well as talk talk and I respect that but if one looks at\nCurrent polling and you say well when you you'll wind the movement has been around for a couple of years but you on you so the fact you'll scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that pass and they don't know if you owned by the way and get a ... will let you know listen bankrupt lead for longer than I Do not want to figure out what all they want to get to is this\nThe only country in Europe right now where the land in its more radical form is actually doing well or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom and if so what makes an you know the u._k. very well want in your view makes\nJeremy cool Britain's Labour Party different from so many of the other\nLeft movements in Europe and across the world today\nWhat Brexit has had to do with it because ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about ... I mean I was gonna say labor party view and breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I well you sound fusing issue if you're confused when you're facing a confusing issue are you a fanatic\nBut given the opens position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the moments when I'm Down to\nYou said it was it created a station in this country\nThat British democracy and they throw in the world and not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the bright side this gives the people who have Britain and opportunity to reconsider their position in the world and I believe that the judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively die\nTied the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's causing any assessment of this even with that or it's\nInteresting so you would say because you talked about the last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of near liberal economic ... you would say that Tony Blair was in no way of left of center politician would you\nWhat does it mean\nOn the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money to the national health service money that they thought he said stop the national health service off about that very same time he did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye\nTo the private money man thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse in two thousand and eight so it was\nWhat I'm getting too is that the John Macdonald the the the current shadow chancellor of the exchange or here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example\nThe man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. of a need to have ten percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each work on the excess beyond that would go to the government so it actually is a huge new corporate tax it would fundamentally change the relationship between the state and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote for that\nI think so and I'm very glad to have hut or John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing angle so McDonnell about the program we eras things you've been saying for cyber opposing it precisely that\nWith one difference I've been proposing the creation of a social ... fund where that ten percent of the shadows after every ... or ... by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed to the former universal basic didn't\nWhereas they revise the is leaving them up amongst the workers within those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the liberal part of the confederacy may go into the mind if I saw I Hope it does it is a very interesting discussions are that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the divisions between competed and labor but it differently statement once upon a time when a ... volt a machine that machine belong to the ... and then the investors who claimed the profits of the machine produced for the company but these days of Google and fate\nBut these days of Google and Facebook when every time you search and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a sense for that except for Google we have to reconsider that property rights over that he'd sense of capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world\nThat he's doing these okay so for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually\nIn the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I just always\nIs they're looking at some point say to yourself you know what democratic politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP ... said she said recently and there's no such that we need to topple the government and we can't do it at the ballot box\nWe will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that you kind of policy what's actually if I could not be legal to last time I checked them illegal immigrants and he's right now that your view on when you kind of politics needs to go\nWhat freshly let's be clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes of extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the way that we support democracy so to answer that great I'm going to quote from Winston Churchill\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but it's the best of all of sudden they've and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that it's pretty straightforward answer to your question now whether strikes a part of the political democratic process I Do believe that they are\nOn the ... we have to end a lot of factors I thank you very much for being on ... thank you [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

had\nWith that he wrote the nervousness hopped into a car and vanished talk of full three locations arrive in this area villages evicted from their homes phones with little or no compensation perhaps the real question\nIs what all of this is full will China actually deliver on the dream of shown and the new green city professor ... again from the University of North Carolina\nThis is a really top down planning project in that politically that has high profile\nYou have studied over the last two or three decades all of the range of these infrastructure project caliphate yeah and there's another one isn't it a port in northern China championed by Hu Jintao or a former prime yet but it's come to nothing I mean there have been white elephants as well as success stories in China\nYeah it's how they did was to become an ecological zero sort of emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut a shoreline this case just keep in mind that within the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned business is\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really read top down\nProfessor young so I mean that report came out a year ago no much seemed to be happening just then since those days are the government has issued more plans for the development prove that does seem to remains slow the\n... city planner for showing and new district uh he he ... he's the city planning gee he said that they will range of environmental problems in the area including a high flooding risk and poor access to transportation this is what he said in his speech\nIf these two problems and not to be solved\nSolved it would be like building a ... tip it ... me as high standards the government brought up for this new town\nWell Gabriel will die out is uh the Shanghai bureau chief for the Financial Times he went to the site recently this is what he so\nIt's definitely still early days for this mega projects I said when they were just completing the centerpiece of the first days they're still on public service Centre and that kind of many within it any that include electric cars charging stations and\nSensors are based on that recognition hunting hasn't sensors around the whole city is a teacher a hotel that that include human being free chat in they planted thousands or train around this dancer but beyond a public servant center it's quite\nA quite barren where are you still feel good lead an elementary surrounding the central services center\nWell George maintenance is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nI'm Joe ... basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty as it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand eight actually as the financial crisis in the west started to send ripples through China um\nAnd uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happened in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nAbout the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so\nEvery time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit worldly I'm you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments are on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a ... leads to you know better growth\nThat you see huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nA because actually if it was that simple than every would you need for growth who's just build ...\n... ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever\nThings forever and it wasn't always give you the same time that it did it the ...\nYes indeed and I think again you know like so many things in everything is so nuanced so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure head of population of course it still some way behind Japan\nA soul in Asia or you know American cities and European cities but um you know as long as ... the kind of famous British economist once said in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks go cities and and actually the problem\nAnd it can also lead a goal to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well uh it\nIs about the end of two thousand and Seventeen was around three hundred and thirty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nI thought it was like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fair weather that there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis infuse bought certainly the the miss allocation of resources\nThe cumulative increase its difficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding bad loans you know what they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a novel a tile and uncertain short term sauces and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now\nYou've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China and from there and other risks\nWell I think I'm trying to that isn't the only problem joined the faces that it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging and you know technology um the currency stability and so on the difference that I think uh the last few years of made is that ... governance system has
