distribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio content eight PM American public media with support from see three I O T\nAnd you have a headstone decode when you're treating patients on the ground what difference does it make if you're a woman\nIt's a huge difference you know the way they listen to you the way they\nYou can share a lot of deep connection and they're very open to you in discussing the sexual issues there Ninety eight percent of some other woman went to the empty and female genital mutilation so their challenges their difficulties stay facing you know\nAlso their rights biggest challenge you face in as physicians in Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait or has been a brother or someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you this is your body you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent Activision work we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just asked what was your breakfast I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten you\nBecause she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids and she had been even eaten you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to like and everything\nI think for my last eleven years\nLast eleven years since I went back home my view it's completely change because I got my education from Russia and I spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extremely low in the condition until Monday we don't have blood bank so we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact today that\nThe blood and and draw divide so we struggled after you know six seven hours looking a blood transfusion card and she's good to go on a number of ... you cannot have children you have to wait you have to do this given all this\nPatient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet and I was so serious you know starting preaching hairy you know you want to die you ought to do this\nAnd by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just got my second husband if I don't give him a child he will just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children from\nThat day on I just my views become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being a physician who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill and Web page\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the first ones off coupon about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for a loan because most treatments were designed for men no women went inside well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only a clinical trials but the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't\nWe don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals there's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle\nAnd that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model and even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of a disease that affects the chief ... different she sure\nLet me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see in cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries and the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference so if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked\nThere are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow Dick who you are working in ... a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority what degree just Barry is chief picked his treatment for the women in UK\nEverything you can imagine it there I guess when you don't have in your situation where you don't have lost to follow you know the brutality happening to the woman his body and all the way ...\nThe way to admit to lead the way they don't allow him in ... surgeries\nBecause the man said so or because of their is declined to fish and so if you're a woman and you married from one client and you born from others so you become an object of the\nRivalry between the two clients and they will not allow you to go your own house procedures to the woman all effective by this plan rivalry\nDefinitely they affected in many levels but if things not improved with the new government [noise]\nNot yet the whole health\nSystem is run by a World Health organization the government is very poor didn't do enough money to invest in healthcare steal everything you focus in its among tuition and infection where we'll neglecting their diabetes and chronic diseases so it's still difficult it's still hard and one thing that\nThe health care with improved for the last\nCouple years it's a family planning program and it's called child spacing so that's the one area we got progress and we educate much mother is and we give the injection we have delivered all hospitals the\nInjection is and and birth control bills so we're pushing on that site and I'm very proud to have those [noise]\nAppoint teasing translate you research and teach into biology how do you translate that when you're working in the type of environment that ... describing you're\nReally thinking about what are not only the disorders that diseases that affect women\nBut also what is the context of that disease\nSo for example if we were to start to think about lung disease\nIn certain areas for example in Africa and other places at one of the main causes of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves you see what the end result is but how do you begin to understand and unravel\nNot only what is the cause of it but how do you change practice some practices so connected to culture and to use those structures within a culture to change behaviors and that's something that doesn't happen overnight\nDeclare anything to add to that you're right it's just cultural change and also development change you know government to test to change it not only hospitals and medications you just took the but still housing sanitation plumbing\nPlumbing old that includes the hell is having a better environment it prevents a lot of diseases\nOn the sports that making woman tells the priorities are we talking about on the conversation today would talk to pull that Johnson a cardiologist and women's health expert and up to ... who together with a mother and sister when hospital in camp for many women and children who were displaced by ... in Somalia [noise]\nPut your ideal he's and has ... it's not just\nPie in the sky because in most health care contexts aides not practical to implement such a nuanced approach we're not\nTalking about adding additional resources on the front line\nAlthough sometimes that is necessary what we're talking about is an approach of looking at health and health care delivery through a gender lands using the best science but also the best understanding of how women are leading their lives I Would actually call that really good medicine\nBut with the news by listening in the mornings to MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\n\nMORNING EDITION weekdays beginning at five AM right here on a

east of Amsterdam it's ... it's in the Netherlands I properly retro solution is only to as old as mankind\nSo did it if something is broken go just go ahead and\nFix it the problem is you often need the time the tools and the ingenuity and where I Am now has got older voters in abundance it's an event cools RIMPAC cafe Trump folders runs this RIMPAC by takes on a tour of this is going on inside this room head now where are we\nWe are at a ... percent which is the location of our monthly repair cafe is kind of a community center right it's a community center where people are playing chess and bridge and so All right but some of them we open our repair can pay and we open meetings where we fix stuff\nRight so there are also tables set around here and there are people started the tables and there's some people who brought stuff in the broken right\nYeah exactly um we have a hostess ah that's where people checking\nSo when people come in at the table and they say a goldfish is bussed yeah you fix\nAnd then we try to open my eyes itch register the person that is that is a coming in and I can and then we will bring them to one of all fixes who I Will try to repair it together with the one\nThat is his name so much the person can't reject that go for someone who uh volunteer they built on to their old on his here everybody in his room ... someone that is a candlestick\nYeah there's a silver a candlestick Ron it's and cheek I think\nRunning it too much uh right well I think that's\nSort of this study is that it does and then if we're going to have someone fixing a lemon\nKnow there's been ebbs and flows that right now it's fairly busy um we had a ten year old has come in with the best slump she wanted fixed I'm a doctor but his suitcase there's been a few people who brought electrical appliances and like I'm a blender and um\nAnd um something I Can't quite recognized as a boom box and somebody's getting their shoes fixed um so it's been interesting I think some people are bringing in bicycles as well\nYeah so we're we're both she broke Austin from a community center in in this town ... where are you actually in Bangalore\nI'm In the basement of hospitals that give them their space to do this river cafe so this is run from the basement of a hole in the basement of hospitals really that's interesting and it's and it's a bright open face I wasn't expecting it to be quite as a basis and welcoming and I've got to do with me she's one of the co founders\nAnd also for an hour I was actually I yes ah why did you feel there was a need for repair cafe in Bangalore because we in in in Holland we would think that's in India people would still have repair skills\nAre we mistake on\nThe need for the fact is that because the older generation of bad is getting lost we are living in um\nA nuclear families and a a via not seeing a A R people that are betting that owned us so that ... that is a need to bring this concept again here debate is dating a gene for the genes of sleeping and I know that we need to\nMake it if you need to open it up I'll make it\nAll got lots of repair business has an engine run anyway\nThere are many ... said that although this is also the pick of the bed there's a big market nearby it's around the corner\nHow can you get away from you know harming other businesses you say you're taking a long viewed away from us\nSo in this debate you have professional to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business over\nCareer and I like to point to go ahead what we find is obviously politics is a it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they called the full to take something along to a professional repair uh I'm guessing assessed tend to be told it can't be repaired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we scientists were taking it to repair us so we take ... some of the expense or on the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC I don't have those discussions about it\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future do get repaired back in to our daily lives is that the professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is sex tidy\nSo we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that's a professional repair to become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional ... around their business and um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different on labor costs in different policies of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening I\nOne thing I Want to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work and just the costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff man has been the first place and for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit to a landfill sought the other day I was listening to this why\nWon't become to protect today and I'm Talking some topics on me to have [noise]\nThrow a this is the gold and children's broke yeah yeah he found that and take a break at the yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair rule I don't know if he's a so frightened ... holes in the ... so nice out I mean I Wonder when someone could replace a missile POWs [noise] they might be able to taste and\nBy people even though there are just I just think it's just easier to get rid of it they might they might have been up to is it is it the time as well during the time yeah fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just started raining here sometimes it's just not practical exactly\nWhat's in it that was\nKind of stuff to go to loosen cameras stuff you know\nWhen you put a whole new lens and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um Georgia a point where they can't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so ... to the bottom could you ...\nYou could drive but there's not really much point that it wasn't going to take you to pieces and clean around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the ultimate quitting and it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that was in ... to about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that and sort of ... was a real hair it ten times\nTen times that much so you've got your your\nYour lenses and we're going to put them in the world is is this little applause has been no I've already been up here and how to look and here we go\nWe should really be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is designing says superseded\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if the new companies could be generally cheaper than able to quit when I think that's a better job\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way that too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously of people are pretty busy that day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around who are very conscious about their environment that that same bag you know we get in some parts we get ... response because\nPeople want to do their bitch in uh in their surroundings and so that the things they are actually doing a lot of that sort so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of address ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe you you would kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because you know that already on board with the environmental movement without repetitive and how'd you get the other people how do you correct\nMe other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip you are quite happy just to throw stuff away\nWell that's the challenge of course\nBut we hope to get them into the repack I say when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that went into fresh is broken object that cannot be easily replaced by the chief you type and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... they don't really expect things to be read that but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nWhere they were running short time now his RIMPAC cafe in Holland is still still carrying that some people that are fixing a for a machine that pulled their Paul there's a chapter with a large Sean and get him into the workings of the device some final thoughts on from every ... months you know where to start to it can be in ten Fifteen Years time\nI think that will be more repack cafes because they'll they'll\nThey'll be needed but we also hope that manufacturers realized that product\nRealize that that should be re bearable and that they should be a produce in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way maybe you might have a\nThree D. prints are in in ... so you could principles bad policy to to fix the things that you don't have the baseball strikes a way that will be challenging but um maybe in the future you you'd love that Christmas you Oh yes I mean I think the future of RIMPAC face\nIs much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe and it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships I'm kind of slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product

stranding scheme\nThis is a little different to what we would normally see in in ... usual mortality events because I'm the conferences that are coming in I shall incredibly decomposed so\nUm we we are she had an investigating this last month pathology point of view in more from a sort of oceanographic aspect to try and work out why these animals have come from\nSo it's not that they're being washed off and then they die that that when they reach the surface\nYes exactly um so when we we we have an investigation program that looks at uh the causes mortality of of mammals are stations sales are such a [noise]\nAnd I'm In the past we've had what are called must running events why are we to end up on the beach and that law I'm a significant number of animals I'm all in one group um some of them still in the wars that some of them on the beach some of them lives in them that\nI'm On we investigate to try and work out why they spending happened in this case it's it's a very different picture of what we've seen is over the course of the last six weeks we've had a an an increasing incidents of\nI'm a very unusual species that's being washing up I'm light from the sort of the the goal why pay an island all the rights to the top of Scotland um so it stays taken us a while to put the pieces together these animals are not alive um they've been dead for for several weeks at sea\nUm but it's very unusual to to get any of these animals coming on TALK shows\nHow many in a normal year would you see and how many of you've seen this year [noise]\nIn a usual yeah um we would get probably between three and four animals in Scotland of this particular species a it's a ... it's a it's quite a cryptic species we now she very little about these these class substitutions 'em and\nAnd this year so far um we've had sixty eight of these animals that have been washed up I'm On the shores of islands Northern Ireland in Scotland I'm forty five alone in ... which\nIs [noise] they live very deep and the water don't they so what do you think what what is it what is it possible speculate might be happening [noise] well\nThis is what makes this quite tricky because they um they as you say that there are species that live well off the shelf hedge so they they inhabit deep ocean trenches they can they held the record for both the deepest and the longest dive of any any animal\nUm they've been ... to just a under three kilometers down and they can spend up to two hours down there\nThe reason they go into the the the such extreme environments just because that's where they can find that food which is a squid\nAnd um these these ... to a large number of them off the off the shelf hedge so this is the normal habitat for the species\nI'm now ... there's the problem is is that when these animals wash your shoulders by limited amounts of pathology that we can divide from from them because it in such a extensive station decomposition\nHowever we are I'm aware that this particular species\nIs particularly sensitive to I'm underwater noise um human ... underwater noise in an in specifically effect to ... on that something that we would want to try and establish whether or not with any particular activities going on off the shelf age\nI'm In the last a couple of months that put a lot of this this this noise in the million and bottom\nAny ideas because you know humans haven't been quiet and the seat for quite a long time but something like this should be happening now seems remarkable\nAnd indeed doesn't mean we we've we've made the oceans of I noisy place and a ... of the general problem in this specific case\nFrom them we have is is that this out of the people that all the lights the mid writing sign all off in the military\nAnd loving information from than can be quite challenging um the reason that the military operates a an a sudden this frequencies is that it's used for um communication source to use for locating underwater objects such submarines\nSo I'm obviously this is this is sensitive at a national security level so they're trying to get the information as to whether they'd be an operation can be challenging however what we hope to be able to do is to establish whether or not this a noise is a plausible\nA noise is a plausible reason that these animals timed it so we want to let all the other things that could potentially have caused them to ... which has talks in this old infectious disease I'm I'm trying to establish walked what is the most likely reason for this this large mortality\nSo many

around\nThey go to a very complex ballot to deal with for the first round there Thirteen candidates for president um they've got a book for state deputies federal\nDeputies senators I think when it comes to the presidential election it's shaping up into a two horse race between for them to a dodgy ... both NATO and those are that's a difficult choice for many Brazilian voters because of the nature of both the candidates and the parties that they come from\nHow much do Brazilians want to vote for this pack of politicians bearing in mind that Lula who you know once upon a time had the reputation of a U.S ally saint and is now in jail for corruption and all the other corruption scandals around the\nFederal company and the buying of votes how excited are Brazilians about voting for any politician\nNot sure that that excited that there's a lot of trepidation about this one and many people will be choosing the lesser evil or the the least bad candidate that they can find Brazil was sort of on auto pilot from the period Nineteen Ninety four to two thousand and ten you had a series of elections where\nWhen there was a second round of the presidential election it was a choice between us\nShould it was a choice between a center right candidate in the center left candidate\nAnd they agreed on a lot of major policy issues and now you've got\nQuite a hard right candidate enjoyable some out someone who's economic advisor Paolo get isn't saying you know privatize every state on the price that you can have a flat tax let's end affirmative action in universities lets the ideal or jazz or\nSchools teaching and so on and then you've got Fernando ... from the workers' party which rules from two thousand three to two thousand and sixteen and many people don't want to see back so you've got a hard core that would be very disappointed at either a dodgy or abortion out presidency\nSo does that mean that a ... who has a reputation for being very outspoken and very unpleasant ways talking about we had five children unfortunately one of them was go\nThat kind of thing because at least he something different and the corruption ... so many who are on the progressive side is he likely to win\nI think if you look at the polling there was a new poll today that had the second round scenario had\nBoth ... and a dodging a technical tie it forty two percent each so he definitely has a chance to win the election we also said about the dictatorship of sixty four to eighty five the mistake of the dictatorship was to torture and not to kill\nIts opponents so he's got a very hard line stance on that and his vice presidential candidate general Modelo has talked about well maybe if there's too much disorder the military is going to have to close down Congress I Would say yes he has a chance to win\nIt may be that the antipathy and the electric to the Workers Party is going to outweigh the reservations that people have about some of these things that both so NATO is set in their offensive to women it's afro Brazilians gays and so on whatever the outcome is likely to be quite close between the two of them\n[noise] that is professor Anthony ...
