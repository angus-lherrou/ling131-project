don't feel comfortable joking about it and things like the impact\nOf gender based violence of things like homophobia are so\nHuge that we can't even ... try to minimize those issues because you give a green light to people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in disciplines where maybe we're making light to the

if these new voters do turn out and there are some signs that they're going to be more likely to turn out really does give a boost to the Democrats in a district like this is reaching out to voters from\nThe mile campaign and the final days of his campaign will come down to which candidate get their message out that and which party can turn out there I don't know until I was just wild campaign and we're just knocking on doors [laughter] which checking in with\nAnother topic reporting and as you heard in others report the economy healthcare to the key issues for Republicans and Democrats a head of the voting next week\nWell what are the polls say about the issues the uppermost in voters' minds I've been speaking to leave Maryland Gulf director of the Marist College poll on to the ... and independent polling and election consultant first cafe what issues does she think will help voters make up their minds but I find\nThe most fascinating thing is that the polls suggesting that we have two completely different electorate the Republican electorate which is motivated now say they are motivated now by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care that means that it's an election that is operating basically on two separate tracks\nAnd Lee what difference might the pipe bombs and the outrage in Pittsburgh ... what difference might they make you think\nI think there's a tone in the closing days of the campaign that can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issue that is to talk about in partisan terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week of the midterm campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with\nAnd this affects people's outlook towards the stage of the country\nAnd Lee has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican Party\nWell I think it's interesting because there there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished\nI think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say\nWell you know he's got some odd characters are things that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nOr who are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you're stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference in polling data between people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump\nIt's not as if one group is any different from the other\nOn in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues from President Trump and while they may not have an opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading\nThe party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I also can add something about we've had shootings in the United states\nWe've had a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in us surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before an election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncover your what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nSpent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the root\nBart women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects opinion\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged can be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of that critical group of voters\nAnd the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates that these these independent voters and especially independent women and independent women who may be in the living in the suburbs\nWho are the ones who are if there is a swing group that's probably the the group of voters that does euro in ...\nWhen we encounter unless finished by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party I'm much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I it's really losing the influence how do you see that really\n[noise] well I you know [laughter]\nI think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have anything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point\nOther than there's a lot of globalization among the Democratic party I don't think the Democrats have necessarily pick sides so which part of them is going to dominate the process I think they're a unified in their opposition to president jumped at this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker if the Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short answer from each of you or how likely use it for the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate ...\nWell I think you do that\nThe short answer from each of you how likely is it that the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate ...\nWell I think the ... and I suspect cat will agree with that I mean the conventional wisdom maybe right on the house is likely to go democratic in the Senate like Tuesday Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of a Democrat but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result in a Democratic majority in the house of representatives\nThe Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the front it just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats for on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse those old it's just that all these Democrats are states Trump carried\nLabor and golf director of the Marist College poll and Kathy Frank of it and then and then holding an election consultant you'll have your own views you might have your own votes let us know on Twitter at BBC than they really would like to know of course he'll have full coverage of\nThe run up to the vote and the result here on the BBC well so [noise]\n\n[noise] and you're listening to weld updates
