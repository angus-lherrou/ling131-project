Steve how are you in ... because sometimes they really are ... I don't always have a\nFull or the lyrics meanings I can walk away and come up something completely different but you know if that has something to say that they want to show in the video and I have to take that into consideration\nOkay Kenny unless it's to me see now you go from page to final products like what are you techniques\nSo you know they gave me this song I go back I could listen to a song and meeting yesterday snatch is of pictures in my head like I just see like steel frames and then I just have to do things together and sometimes it takes me\nA long time I got to play the song when I'm brushing my team I got to play when I'm cooking when I'm drinking some why\nBecause the thing I'm trying to the way from is thinking about the idea is never watch for me I don't think about the idea and then she would\nCome to me in ways and you know when I'm seeking and that's why we have looked at when I'm speaking with a pen I did get up and I write it all down because I Know I'm going to forget as soon as I get up and I try to make it as a visual as possible in words and then I sent it to them and hundreds if another hundred the article I Love that idea\n[laughter] really a hundred percent I I don't know I didn't I didn't believe I I I Do have to say that's that's what it is I shouldn't have been hearing about it and you know\nAnd then of course I think at some point the level of trust that has come in and in my career boosts all\nTypes of ... of course it gets to a point I was like OK me say this is what we need to do I trust that this is what we need to do I because I'm ... I'm a business person\nSecond to last me quintuplets than but we're not pitching while cutting that idea very passionate about it I can see I can teach and I can feel it I Do everything from the when you look at the dress you're going to win the ... the entire\nVision is what you just have to show up and you'll boxes\n[laughter] you know let me let me I can get 'em\nTimmy talks about repeat to listening to the ... over and over again she's brushing my teeth which is drinking wine what about you how do you come to to get that vision for that so\nYeah I really relate to that I've definitely listen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore\nAnd and I also find that\nListen to some ... many times where I can listen to them anymore [laughter]\nAnd and I also find that sometimes you do just need to exhaust the listening process until you just can't you almost it's subliminal you know you almost like yeah you don't even hear the lyrics anymore you just\nSometimes it's good to just sit with that you know if you count the problem is sometimes you get a track and I like can you get the treatment by the end of the week and it's like a Wednesday and friday you know so\nThat's kind of tricky and I think for me personally I don't know if it's because I might be in like a slightly bigger market well maybe I'm just not as popular with director Comey but you know occasionally I Do get out of that come to me directly\nBut more often than not I am actually pitching against other directors\nSo that's a little trickier because sometimes an artist cannot talk to study directors or twenty directors have many imaging hang ours I recently pitched on the cot is a ... and Jay Z and I knew that there was some big guns in the ... pitching on that project and\nI knew I was lucky to be invited you know but I knew that I definitely wouldn't be able to get on the phone with them because in that ... busy schedule I'm not sure they had time to talk to kids [laughter]\nSo I just had to come up with an idea and like what's the best you know I didn't quite know at that time but that's the part of being a director is that there is a little bit of a risk involved you have to say I haven't had a hundred percent success to show\nThat maybe it's being a director and pitching on American artist and you ... it can potentially be more competitive out that because I Know there's a lot of direct it out there\nIt's the biggest skill you if you're fishing for me on the energy project [laughter] that's a that's a larger scale up what you need to watch him of course with some amazing art is but then I think I'm lucky by the time to come to me that kind of meet up their mind but then again it's not genes look beyond that\nYou are listening to the conversation I guess we'll too would we need music video direct his ... and Kenny ... from Nigeria so you booze operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with all huge big names and know exactly what the ones\nCan sink Kenny of specific examples where you've had to navigate accommodating to sit and listen holding on to create a vision and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been\nTo navigate accommodating to sing holding on to create position and I knew him he said that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody when it's going to be a little bit differently say just Indonesia yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't that way because I mean I have to put myself in a specially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps going to let it is a male dominated field and that ... the editor cross all starting off\nOn television so I was a funny person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had was every time you get the opportunity\nYou have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did well official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony\nAt I was one of those and they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm a direct analogy but yeah I mean that's what we want you to start when you come out of state and things like that\nAnd I mean I'm not just from one they had one day I had a dream about the concept to try to be as visual as possible and I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like it was like actually love this treatment can I buy it off your like that's the I call it that is one\nAnd I need to make a decision that point you're not like that you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better deal because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that chalk eventually\nTo position myself and it was imperative that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten more boosted tuition but that is the only person I've ever had to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to you know a lot of people call me they don't even remember girl so [laughter] because they just need a music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's\nBeen like I can talk about how much you're charging [laughter]\nI'm very expensive\nVery kinds of things you never know how they ... you don't have to give me the exact\nFigure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project that things I charge denied that things are charging dollar um their ... their partners like I'll give you figured that projects do that I Do for\nThat things are charging a ...\n... they're probably like I'll give you figured it projects that I use for nothing at all that what I lead me the most money when they came to me my budget with a little bit too much for them I really loved the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in\nThat particular project might not have\nLightened my pocket at that point in time would have probably made me the most money down the line because people are seeing that and gone I needed to work in this project and I saw that somewhere\nIt's an effort is going to be given to me I mean you can get at your level now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much he's challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because there's a rule of thumb that older actors get temp set of budget\nWhat would be typical budget I mean can you give me an example of the budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand US dollars and we talked about ten thousand US dollars\nIt can be it can be either hum let's say a low budget project is around ten thousand\nAnd that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work ... you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter]\nBecause as a matter of hours you put it into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of caution you pocket\nIn order for us to

years but because of cuts to spending so on the one hand he want to not be cutting spending because we want vandals territory but on the other hand he needs the deficit to come down until eventually be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it fully going\n... so it's not going out for finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting a more money the public services particularly mental health services\nAs well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to base to Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it needs to be you yes I miss the Hammond is expected to tell and pays today that the really big decision on public

on the agenda this year last week the European Union announced that single use plastic such as plates and cutlery was to be banned\nThe member of European Parliament behind this Frederick Greece I spoke to weld updates on that day\nPlastic was a great invention\nA but since the fifties I Would say uh the production has been exponential I don't actually say that in English and now are the oceans are beaches are are dying from the past take 'em at the species are dying\nI'm at the fish are dying and at the end of the day we are eating plastic things plastic everywhere so we had to act Europe how to act\n[noise] all of that ... important as people meet in Bali to discuss the oceans the MacArthur Foundation is one of the organizations taking pot and we're joined by its pounded the former Soviet swimming Ellen because the un and thanks for being with us on well long days\nYou know the oceans very well plastic has become an issue only really in the recent yeah were you aware of this before\nAnd just the my interest in action packed it doesn't come for failing at directly from what I saw in the city but it comes from the facts\nInteresting the my interest in ocean plastic doesn't come from saving a direct see from what I saw in the city but it comes from the fact that when you're on a boat and you're sending around the world\nWhat you have on the boat these all you have you have really finite resources and I very quickly trying to translate that to a global economy when I finished my second round the world and realize that in effect was no different and my interest in plastics come from my interest in how the economy functions how we use materials within our economy and plastic\nPackaging is incredibly high volume thirty like value as a material and a huge amount of it leaks out in the ocean so it was a very different route\nHow then Israel foundation going to work with the stomach and in the future to try and reduce the\nWell the goal of the foundation is to accelerate the transition to a secular economy which is an economic model which differs from my current on our current is very linear type might disposed we take them into the ground who make something out of it and then the majority gets thrown away and plastic packaging is a great example\nWithin a secular economy you tend not straight line and you turn it into a circle so you design economy so that waste is effectively designed out you keep products materials and use for as long as possible and you also have the potential to be generate natural systems what\nWe're doing around plastic packaging members those three areas it's about being regenerative restarted it's about eliminating the packaging we don't need it but innovating around the packaging that we do so that is one hundred percent recyclable combustible over usable\nAnd then the third area is to circulate that material once it's been designed to fit within the system and we have over two hundred and fifty signatures that we've collected for global commitment which we don't here today in Bali around shifting towards that model by twenty twenty five\n[noise] intentions are great it's the enforcement that's going to be the thing isn't it that's not going to be using\nI intentions all great but I think intentions are important in the right direction and I think one thing that's been missing from the sector is everybody innovation ing innovating sorry and the right direction what we've done is we've we've put together a specific\nSet of targets together with the organizations the government the city's the regions and also some of the biggest companies in the world we have we reckon twenty percent of the\nPlastic packaging world by volume signed up to the commitment already so these time bomb target that everyone has agreed on we don't have all the answers to how to get that yet but we do have these Tom time ... and we will bury 'em every Eighteen months will be refreshing them so this is about becoming one hundred percent we saw a couple of combustible reusable by twenty twenty five\nI'm ... not the only issue which is living with the finite resources\nOne hundred percent
