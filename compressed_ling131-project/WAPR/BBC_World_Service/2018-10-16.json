a is twenty two minutes policy on this week Harvard University in the U.S\nIs fighting a lawsuit brought on behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission athletes houses the policy known as affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in\nThis means that they're not less in just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in but what kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have that chance is boosted by some direction racial balancing it's cooled\nThat we hear from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly ...\nI confront an Asian American background and a student at Harvard\nAnd I think I should have credit Wright's chicken is university and after ... many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case yeah the feminist action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but how affirmative action is in ... and the point of affirmative action has been\nSo has been any support communities that have historically the under represented are excluded it seems like it's South Asian Americans right now as it looks like hardly any nations policies are\nDiscriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace Lauer it's hard to say what Microsoft ... looks like a set of how it affected me that I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ACA rapidly but the amount of Asian acting admitted to Harvard\nHas been saying around the focus on that path hadn't yes\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of sense and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action in support of affirmative action is not actually said\nTo make a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's been talked about how much in this lawsuit is\nWhat it means to have a critical mass here at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly\nAsian students um don't have to walk on campus and feel like they're necessarily represent this other group um or that they have to speak for every person from their background on this is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students of Chinese background however for African Americans\nFor Latino Americans were indigenous Americans as has not said this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even ways affirmative action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you were ... you were at UCLA and one of the complications to this fight disease that in California\nSo much of action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume ... that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and it was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of twelve African Americans um this is in\nThe state of California which is as much more than just a farce\nMore than just a four percent or ... or ... three or four percent African American and this is an environment in which I was you know in class and the debate in highly intellectual and highly social issues that involve things like race um in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room this huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll have to study principles and argue about\nSort of intellectual facts are with without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it is very rarely happen that\nWay but for example in your class was than not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how do we should define them or have they all ... managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support in critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there aren't underrepresented sub groups\nWere going in Asian Americans are among the ... or ... or Southeast Asia and Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um in all facets of higher education\nBut if we're gonna talk about Asian Americans a as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice affirmative action in I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think it has a lot to do with the caliber\nStudents applying um the number of students applying um and we did they decide to aggregate their applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot of sense that a lot of Asian Americans apply to harbor um one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much\nAs that I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year um roughly\nAs Asian American but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every\nWeld they you up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is an argument that uh is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment\nJust say it's a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action but Harvard has a private institution\nOr because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do it and it's just it's a private institution\nIt's a private institution that they can make life goes on you know\nLess than ... do you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and uh many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases\nOver the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... not just in the academic\nSphere and um there's lots of

journalists politicians all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real issues are those that can be invented\nAnd controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth come to mind\nAnd one can only imagine what he thought through social media and the Internet today that cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only sought models of language and figures like Shakespeare gr attuned Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um the image as as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross solve language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing ... crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThat's for cross was all an indication that there was something deeply arise in the morality\nA ride and the morality of the author or more likely a one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross has more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings\nThat are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate sloppy language to either hidden duplicitous ... or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and he's on schools offer solutions to classic works of Jim and Jim and Shakespeare as you said and he was so continue the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few of these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book form several times\nBut he himself was also way of the limitations\nEnough of them never coincides with the tricks it is either a ... year old woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think most particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows it's only Katrina why was it so important to him\nWhen I think at us had to really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't go out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm\nThe director max Reinhardt who has maybe famous that cross this time in Germany especially um he developed a day on a mental navy showy and productions and contrary to college he kind of embrace that he actually to land a but what crossed imagined or was it\nWas it ... or just to stage for this book and good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama itself and that seems\nSo the picture on getting of crass than is before the first World War it was someone who is surrounded by lots of ... lost his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably had a choice in punt the out of circumstance I mean this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it simply because crosses born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own or relationship maybe better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in some sense never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong to me I think this is one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements cross was going to a private men and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that his great love was through the ... not hung up about ... and patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south of crossers but based in what is now the Czech Republic\nAnd the only country in the what was that relationship like\nBy the first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war\nAnd as he didn't even that Danny like CD as he called her she inspired class to write poetry and he also wrote 'em over a thousand letters to hurt you in the court system relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nTell us staff and maybe it's especially noteworthy that crossed yet his hands full with a his work you just mentioned the nine hundred and twenty two issues of to fucking that didn't he didn't mean that Danny's case I he really sat down and wrote like every other day and very novel data\nHer lettuce to him my last um we don't have them\nBut do we know from his letter that he shows have very different kind of personality and in them he's really in love ... I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to marry properly another race the crowd\nBut she's still kept having a relationship with crowds continued to meet him to travel to gather and you can really call her one of the most important um women ...\nQuite a few so that he had this lonely image isn't true yet actually quite a full of life I think\nAnd incidentally has oh she provided a quiet place to rest and worked for him and she may have inspired some grants his best a limit perjury here is the end of a poem cooled to a wrinkle in you\nTend to do well remembered line praying a suit to rest muscle so that this final trace of gold league race may remain\n\nAnd even the grill is was usually suspicious of new technology an interesting factors that he did by a calm fairly early on in Nineteen fourteen and soon when he was so taken by the pleasures of Dr ... she became one of the first female holders\nOf a driving license in Austria Hungary but the carefree days of muttering across Europe was soon ... by the outbreak of the first World War and how crowds react to the war is the subject for the second part of this for them from the BBC will say this will be back in a couple of them are [noise]\n[noise]\nOf the b._b._c.
