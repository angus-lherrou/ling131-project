from one of the authors and moving\nEssentially the report said we can't go on like that and if we do like adding to dangerously destabilize the F climate cities cars and buses and everything else around me it's going to need to be powered by renewable\nBut he's not possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have the kind of throws we've got used to say\nOh well we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic and what does that mean the politics cannot lead is the sweet ... to make big sacrifice that\nWell there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the theater now me\nNice to have had a panel is Laura ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University bubbled he's the policy director at the grandson instituted climate change at the London School of economics Julius Steinbeck I he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University\nI'm Molly Scott's case to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than and nuts you reverse gal he's one of the office of this week's IPC the reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep rising label temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to me or anything like that target festival\nTo clarify that the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have to ask the IPC\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference wants to be three in one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty thousand mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSo painted the picture Walsh are the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five in two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nThere is a prospect of short flights being possible using ... technology at some point same wave law a long distance trucking juveniles\nEasy not slightly I don't know about the technology but I think that we're going to buy specific technologies but I think we're going to have to face the issue of how we use energy if we have to reduce fossil fuels it's currently constituted about eighty percent of our primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is coming in all of us it's going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say that everybody enjoys flying\nNot everybody but people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things into you know five ... is one of the most environmentally damaging TV's one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people\nIf people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially at so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions 'cause they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible on assignment on American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city center is so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering emissions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand five to ten but some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cost nothing equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra ... prices seem to you again another country and in other countries have heard\nThe most a low income people said larger share of\nTheir income is going into entity so we cannot say that there are no losers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know\nWell so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also now that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nAre emerging of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short\nTerm ... cases if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in that sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television we're seeing massive increasing the amount of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we aren't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five\nPowers target for example I can argue that not in the parliament's no gain support for that were previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world that these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nKnow it was just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already ...\nOne point five degree are forming and recruit degree or form in ... in the far future does this um one point\nFive to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to eat carefully managing managed showed up they she the poor of the impacts of food that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Nineteen nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are that have other policies to stop the renewables and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he says making it easier\nThere isn't to global carbon price for instance agreed no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is\nThat it's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize and there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications and countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so\nIt's this investment ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough ah as they obviously the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this point at he's made also in the report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nSo when we talk about culture's important we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty such even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety truly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure buttons\nStructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is what we could double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities the dock ingested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now think heat panel throughout the as an adult ... genius Steinbeck at ... case had\nAn you eat the gal will take a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story a BBC don't eat cake will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the ... cost you can subscribe to just such for the real story and you'll ...\nYou'll distribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the United states is made possible by American public media with support from their providing global financial resources and market expertise to clients the world over are double ... dot com has more information at home advisor matching\nWill the world's nuclear energy report for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five donors ... when the twin daughters and make it ... I think\nThe point which is a hundred and twenty dollars maybe we'll tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a low coping as quickly as possible in the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through new bills\nSo we'll come evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on a no the more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually accept the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's IPC report I've investigated\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nation\nAs well but I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't is not lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the tactics used the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide gate and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens\nWhat happens at the federal level you go to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other ... chess shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is Easter appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record the storm surge associated with fiat\nIs pick up because of sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the goals were partly puma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the U.S has been gone with this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know kind of an energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the ah swelled the very developed well let's see if we may ... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to join the ... he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joined I won't talk about it\nJoy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then if\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda that's much more to talk about renewables but at the same time maybe just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas\nIn the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection and I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in health\nAnd so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back\nTo the politics because then the cost Indian governments of all give that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you liked caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat it Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save that going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways\nTo bypass the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question is what the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels\nIf I'm going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't even developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to buy boss that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that day is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science and I think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains\nAnd that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to mess in the mountains\nAnd so after consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the coastal sect in India\nThey will really suffer and there's a reason to take that into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\nIt's what's happening in

experimental treatments\nOr fifty four people have ... since the beginning of this outbreak but the real difficulty at the moment ah is not it's just you know the last time that there's an outbreak in a conflict area\nA and through the security situation is is very tense but that\nThat the other issue is not there is a lot of community mistrust a small but significant pockets of of communities of people who are resisting I'm a ... who are quite skeptical of the of the virus in their response and making a ... that that was very difficult is that the ...\nYes because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly removed borders being attacked\nAfter duty or you know there's there's it's quite common to have community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scat but I think you know the specifics of tea with this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area\nWhere there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community uh you know just last week Eighteen people last month sorry eight people were killed in an attack by an armed group on in Benny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city is\nThe city as well and so people are very very scared and angry and has been a lot of protest\nActually being

stop for a few hours either because it's shooting a around the city because of protest\nAnd this is ... their response\nOr the tracing of contacts of people who could be at risk\nI it's it's making

Jonathan you wouldn't know particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course is a loss of a local culture and on local\nUh practices that involve quite close contact with a dead body and so in pasta outbreaks we've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial took a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well is this a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that the very simple measures you you identify people who are infected you isolate them and then you monitor the context of those people and if any of them becoming site to geo isolate them and by just doing this\nIsolation ... a ... monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do the if it's in a in an area of great civil

I was the leader of the use insects and me and I was knowing the person who would got my position when I Would leave and he was very radical and I was really scared about him and\nIt was really hard for me to leave my place to to leave all these inferences allowing within\nYes and you've by studying you've collected well an extraordinary story which you've written a new book inside I F D and you have threats as a result of writing this book\nYeah absolutely um that was a problem before because I wasn't a position to the radicals in the FD but when I leave the party then I recognize that there is no\nSelf control to some members they uh they sent me a message so about ... cans of to me and my family or a wishing me to get raped or\nTo be killed or something like this but on ... and I uh I could get\nGive people hope close a lot of persons in Germany are scared because they have family members or friends who are in the ... are infected with this right wing um positions they are very scared about it\nAnd so I think maybe I can give them some hope that they are of friends can go back from this development\nTo you talk about them ... how scatter you I mean receiving death threats won't fool them did they tell you ... how seriously do you think they were meant\nI changed heck cut and I was hoping that will help but I don't know exactly how a serious there are when I'm reading

you think C I F ... should be stopped how's that going to happen\nSo dad or ... the German constitutional protection Institute I think they have to make the process starting to forbid the FD cars the leader of the party addicts them all and you open the last ...\nParty Congress and then he said that it should be a resolution\nAnd this revolution should stop at the streets\nHe might say that but he and his party is standing for an action yes and I let him across the country if you vote for him surely that's democracy election\nYes that we are in Germany we have to experience from ... to ... that there are some positions a party should never took an in Germany we have some that red lines\nWhat you call and say without being forbidden as a party and if you say you want to attack the democracy

better life in a rich country\n... economic migration has been going on forever or and you can absolutely understand why people looking to leave places that are politically or there's a lot of unrest\nAlso if the poorest people you can see why they they want to better their lives are under often they're willing to do the jobs that the others aren't willing to do is we've seen particularly

contamination which is not a news story\nThe data we've got has amplified what was that before this is the biggest does it's been done on it comes to me but I don't see why they put you on the boxes I Can't believe it's getting to really reduce sales the patient support groups that shot three or four years ago by some of the affected contact then uses they've designed to worship sticker\nBut the contact lens comes could printed on the books it's just the sort of red nose through red signed with the top on it\nAnd simple information like that would be a big help\nI can still around the pull of coming in and telling us all about the pain and not long night when I kept my camera professor Joan doubts that Jane sleeping following the outbreak in the ... that was the flat on a fast of August ... and the Democratic Republic of Congo won't flights as well the world Health Organization\nNow says the outbreak is at a critical juncture juicy the issues with security in the region that now spread of a launch a geographical area of cases of Ebola and also resistance from some members of the community to the health care workers that are going in the south American there are a hundred and eighty one\nTurning to you on cases and the hundred and Fifteen deaths from the disease and has been a little bit of an increasing the number of new cases being identified but he's been very difficult to get\nReally definitive figures on what's going on because all of the violence in the region is making it difficult to do the basics including testing people who are suspected cases to see if they actually do have a boat\nAnd IT security situation is making it difficult to treat people as a lot of that\nBut it it's hampering lots of things to San Francisco to getting to patients but it's also hampering the purchase of contact tracing so the way you stopping Ebola outbreak has you identify case and then you find every single person they've come into contact to and\nYou mentioned trying to do that anyway and a busy bustling city or a remote part of the countryside is difficult when this conflict happening at the same time it's almost impossible say it's a very difficult job\nThe teams from the world Health Organization other agencies half of them and\nThey're also facing resistance from\nThe local population you frequently see this in both cases people not wanting bodies to be taken away and very safe because they remained infection wrist they want to have a usual rich realistic burial processors\nAnd so they're now in some cases if the police happened to ... the teams that are doing the burials in order to protect those people in order to do the safe burial\nSay there's a lot going on that is making this particular outbreak quite difficult to handle and it's why the world Health Organization says it's now preparing for managing this outbreak into twenty Nineteen now\nAnd so patients have to have the disease all their any treatment setting\nAs you remember from the big outbreak in West Africa suddenly there were these handful of cases that were treated with experimental drugs things like the map and monoclonal antibodies that attack the ... well now they're actually being used on patients like on the day that being diagnosed with it but are they getting the drugs\nIn this latest outbreak was only been about fifty or so patients who've been given but these are those experimental drugs to with talked about but never really used in the last about outbreak really being used on the front lines for the first time\nSo in the end we should be able to find out whether these drugs when they do that\nWe'll have a lot more clinical information about whether or not they work it's worth pointing out as we always do that\nThe way that you're going to tackle and about an outbreak is by stopping it from spreading from person to person and this is an interesting aside and will hopefully be incredibly useful for anybody who's called the disease but stopping it spreading is the way you're going to attack on the butter outbreak actually I'm a shame\nRobert thanks very much James now next we'll choking headaches and we own a cold that like\nI get

to events crystallized his support before the election um one was the disqualification of the Workers Party former president we see now sooner rather silver who has been jailed for corruption and then there was another thing\nThere was another thing that happened that drove up votes for both so now to he was attacked during the campaign he was stopped and so therefore he got his big sympathy vote

P. C. C. the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change has come out with a special reports about one point five degrees of warming so one thing is all these protections are against a changing global climate was presumably if they didn't have it\nSo it is that if you were to implement all those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not to happen then for example if we could expect reduction in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them on healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nMarkers spring been from the opposite Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming we're looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere I don't think grilling sauce making a cool to have well generational ready and moving to a third by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case backs solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and some of the simplest way\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter biased being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power winter that makes and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent in the end\nThe atmosphere is one big heat at you and it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporate water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge because of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate constantly\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind some might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a win for him so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't get the cooling effect does a grant from the wind taking heat from the soil what what is it it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night when turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then\nThe biggest effect is at night yes\nHow much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king\nBut that would be with publishing\nWell I mean the effects in the region where large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nBut the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so winter binder immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we did carbon eyes\nI suppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale I'm supposed to have a big event you'll modeling is the last numbers if wouldn't phones yeah\nBut one way in front of us and have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs on his trip for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces climate change over the whole next century over the whole world\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs this just slightly Denton the benefits of wind farms are what you know it's all together I don't think it\nWipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of of seemed to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter brown a race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with winter buys and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number and it's more like half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nNot simple wouldn't because ... very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that yeah solar power\nThat yeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will have environmental and social impact\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at these timeline on active duty Keith climate there's a link

that they have these specialized tied links called how peers and how they're basically to fly equivalent of your inner ear of the stimulus them so they use them for balance\nAnd size can't fly if they don't have their health care so one thing you can do is actually removed the healthcare should not fly and they can still take off but once they're airborne they just lose complete control come through the air and crash\nSo that's not new information the first time someone did that experiment was Seventeen fourteen I think but what we didn't know how the whole chairs actually work though what information where the whole chairs providing to the fly through an artist figure that out what I did was to record from the healthcare neurons\nAnd I found that the timing of single bike with different when I recorded the health care not in a position that stimulated straight flight versus when I recorded while the health care was in a position that simulated a flight rotating basically\nA fly rotating so basically my data showed that five can tell the difference between stable flight and rotation simply by paying attention to the timing of this bike coming from their whole cheering her

or more reflective there on the canals sensation that sort of how you feel I'm as opposed to vision and the reason they use these are there more reflective behaviors is because it's much faster than fish until it's kind of like they can immediately detect rotation and correct it really quickly\nWhat's important about this finding\nImportant for us because this research has shown away that complex aspect of an adult environment can be broken down to the timing of a single spike\nSo this is how our brains initially represent information in the world the truth single spikes anything on there on every thought an experience you've ever had that can be broken down into the activity of these individual neurons Pfizer no different just seem to be here to study fly because they have a lot fewer neurons than a human one\nWhat will it mean for for humans information\nFiner than human neurons work exactly the same way so it certainly helps us to understand how different organisms sensory systems work in order to understand our own\nBut there's also more immediate applications for this type of research that one example would be flight technology wise it had millions of years to evolve fast and efficient mechanism strict line so if we can figure out how they do it we can use some of the same technique to build our own bio inspired technologies\n... yoga and now before we both here
