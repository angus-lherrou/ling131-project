Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports\nOne problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nAre the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy but the sizzling\nCountries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the pace of just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen the fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they're selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe terrorists I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't even here in ... partly counteracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find it cheaper to do so\nIs now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and bill applied Trump ...\nFor for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores used financial information\nBut China system also considers information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's list of on trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went on line to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nHe put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it on our on our news says and this person is on the uh undress whereas it lifts from the court\nLoud one was confused why couldn't he took the train ticket he started looking into this situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loud one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the black lists the on customers and live that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the black with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of his was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nOne ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that with his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist and soon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his account\nOh these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big billboard\nAnother more um be electric ... by the side of the ... plaza\nThere are like huge screens and they're very eye catching you can't really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures on that screen it's like a picture of her on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is an trustworthy loud one says these billboards are all over town she says whenever he went out whenever he to\nThe billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on ... oh my God this Orson we must be working in a semi industry as I did all know up their\nLoudly started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to he started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around about what don't\nYou know I was actually a friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think why are you you're being happy widely used to have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one says he has paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says he will keep paying off his dad has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nStacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer a wife a
