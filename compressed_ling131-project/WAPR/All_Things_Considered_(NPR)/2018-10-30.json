Democratic party or ... started Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidate\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do we do to go around and hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually do not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion the marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election\nI think that the trust by the women's march [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works in communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism posed twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\n... he's the family we show what is\n\nWhat is it\nHe's the family we show what is\n\nWhat\nWhy why\nWe can only\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election\nCycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing ...\nI asked Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I\nGet up relationships in the middle of it because I Lived in the ... the other police officers say something\nLive well he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad is the suit my brother's history there were all star game we use ...\nLike every man in the pros\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nThe country is there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a ... in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nThe CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack so when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the

for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning mega coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively

I spoke earlier today with Angela feral who attended one of the funerals today and she thinks may are built to do do should have met with the president\nI don't think it's a good thing that the mares in here supporting the president I think that the mass of the second\nBut there were other views hear many people feel that this was too soon for this particular president to come I also spoke with Jennifer Huffman her husband's uncle Richard Godfrey died in the shooting Saturday and she thinks President Trump should have stayed away from Pittsburgh\nI've never seen evidence of that I keep hoping to wake up in the morning and the evidence that he'll he'll something more positive about our current state of affairs in our nation but I don't feel that way\nShe's saying there that she doesn't think that this is a president who who can heal the city right now\n[noise] this was a day of mourning in Pittsburgh there were funerals for for men who were killed Saturday with seven more funerals to come in the days ahead you talk to people attending those services what did they tell you\nYeah people here really do think that this is a moment when they want this particular act of

latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump's associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either our first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter ... says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about\nA spokesman for the office Peter car says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special ... special counsel's office is you know it's usually very tight lipped in but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation\nThe bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of events uh earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this looming\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with Mueller in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking at the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting raining here\nTiming is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty sixteen or a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking\nMueller's a sexual assault victims it's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against Miller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nBut you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child enough I'm just lived on a boy of seven I guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... long for the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to sway\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn ... on to some Vermont to be your mind and be now you just hear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke the ground but you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens and everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group the local population is very distrustful of the government even though this part of the ...\nThe issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nLocal populations very distrustful of the government\nEven to this part of the ... he had a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor may believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves we haven't seen anything from the government perhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area\nAnd not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is how ... strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so that's put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even you know whether the ulterior motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person\nSo the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time he was harbinger teams don't go out they don't see the counter\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the outbreak zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence in the D. R. C.\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus on the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has to shift its pieces on the chessboard\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBook the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect we using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ... NPR News\nThis is NPR News\nFootball is a big part of Texas culture and players protesting police brutality during the national anthem has caused a big debate\nAnd the other thing that's different is the empowerment of the anti Semite to express their anti Semitism in ways that are terrified so what new strategies can we\nOr the Jewish community in particular employ\nTo combat the new forms of anti Semitism\nI think the thing that we need to remember\nIs that white nationalism is designed to marginalize all of us and so the the most important strategy we can develop\nIs to come together to develop friendships and trust and relationships\nSo that when we need each other as neighbors and friends and when the white supremacist come knocking on our doors or when they come marching down our

joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this most constitutional Scott\nThis weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because\nRight now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying well\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWell the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending

for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year [noise]\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nYou know we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commits reading about politics they actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion the marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election I think\nThe trust by the women's march I had this call\nFrom this is Michelle ... she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turning away from family we show what is\n\nWhat\nWhy why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to\nAffect their chances of being real known as black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish\nAssure Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nAnd that's what it's

going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\nWhat are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrat\nThat's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a ... in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day the\nOld way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nTomorrow a conversation with Ayanna Pressley

somebody has been monitoring ... for a while now before it was taken down how do people in gab react to the synagogue shooting\nThere was a range of reactions but the ones that were most uh concerning to researcher like me were the ones that we're\nTalking about ... hours as a hero\nAnd one of the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present to clean cut image and other white supremacy are saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nIn the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started Ricks\nAnd that there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour bus again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no platform of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms\nAnd that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nAnd want to play a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed got CEO Andrew tour but about ... hours post when he said specifically the words I'm going and\nWould you expect us to do with those like that you want us to just friends or anybody that's a phrase armed going in that what you're proposing hair and here's the thing he answered the bad or hate speech or we wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this referral yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled with\nTroll cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that gets served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment companies app store is they've all cut ties with gap and yet gab in a tweet estimates it'll be up and running by this weekend\nHow likely is that well I Can't tell you exactly how likely it is that there'll be able to replace\nTheir servers their domain their payments servicing and use the features that they are accustomed to serving to their audience but what we do know is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure are backing out of these partnerships\nWe do now is that these companies that do support them in terms of their base infrastructure\nAre backing out of these partnerships and I don't know if they're going to find companies that are willing to take the risk to their reputation to be known as supporters of gap\nJoined on it and is with data in society a research Institute in New York City thanks very much and thank you\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all

pre Nazi may be coming during the ... air of Russia\nBut just the past right the United states was the land of the free this was a backward looking world that American Jews had left Germany Russia this was not America\n[noise] it feels like you're surprised sort of mirrors our collective surprise over the past two years that\nAnti Semitism had felt like an an American problem and suddenly it was then once you saw in your own in boxing and your Twitter feed and your voicemail I Wonder where else did you begin to see it\nYou know you get your antenna up and suddenly as the twenty sixteen presidential campaign really kicked into gear mhm I started seeing it everywhere\nAre you familiar with this mean called Pepe the frog and one of the people who caught on to that sort of pet they raised with Donald Trump junior who had a thing for re tweeting a lot of neo Nazis interestingly enough on Twitter he posted this on September tenth and there's a right in the middle of this show solidarity with the ...\nRight right with white supremacy we've gone from dog whistle to fall on barking\nAnd because I knew it I could see things out there in the campaign that other people would just go right by I mean for instance there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the three shows\nI mean for instance there was a moment where\nDonald Trump is facing backlash over this tweet that included the star of David the tweet shows the Jewish symbol over images of Hillary Clinton and dollar bills the message over the star says

looks more like a star of David or a sheriff's badge\nThen they said oh no don't be silly that's the sheriff star ... but because I was trolling around looking\nAt the images on these alt right websites I knew exactly where they had gotten that it wasn't some innocent thing they didn't stumble into what they went looking for that image and somehow thought that that was a good thing to send out [noise]\n\nAnd then that's fine no campaign that candidate Trump ran his closing statement for the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nPolitical establishment with a new government controlled by the American people\nDark dark at that spoke of global special interests coming after America\nFor those who controls the levers of power in Washington and for the global nationally a partner with

great again [noise]\nI'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\n\nBut I guess they're still kind of a plausible deniability perhaps to something like that and the Trump campaign whenever they were

president does not like this\nAnd remember the plausible deniability always came from the palace men that is a bunker Trump kind of\nThing you think the president does not like using a prejudiced

he has his son in law who was an Orthodox Jew he has Jewish grandchildren how dare you accuse him of anti Semitism\nSo what is it for though if the president does have a Jewish daughter and Jewish grandchildren entered Jewish son in law how do we understand what you're describing a kind of unmistakable\nAppeals to anti Semitism in an ad like this being present in the campaign\nI think Donald Trump had a very hard time turning his back on his most ardent supporters\nHe and his campaign understood that they had really riled up the far right the alt right and that included racist that included an anti Semite\nI'm not going to accused him of racism or anti Semitism but I Will say that when confronted with the darker side of his supporters he was always very reluctant to denounce them to push them away\nAnd that in your mind is just purely about an electoral calculation by the president by those around them\nIn my mind I Do not think that Donald Trump feels like he can waste or lose a single vote\nSo for me Jonathan as someone who did not have the kind of awakening that you did because of what happened to you on Twitter there was talk of anti Semitism during the campaign but it often still a little ambiguous and I actually remember vividly when that change\n[noise]\nIt was ... it was a white nationalist rallies that seemed like it was about race\nBut suddenly you had

who are orchestrating the white genocide maybe not the field troops the shock troops have white genocide or brown skinned black skin but the orcas raiders of white genocide are Jews that's why Jews
