first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi Gina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district\nWhich has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican in New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae BP to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance\nCandidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think frankly I don't know if it's at at first but it it continues to apply right if\nRight if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's it's hard for me to separate being an allergy to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran and I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals' could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou know the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to el GB to people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nI was in college when HIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and demeaned but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the LDP T. Q. community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene I'm\nSo it's not just happening on the Republican side is definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nI mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it means just\nExactly what Amelia discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYeah one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene in Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running

says healthcare dominates congressional campaign finance out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nAnd the content and laser focused on health care this year\nIt's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when fellow says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless at how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became plant that those visions are in trouble I think that had sort of changed the landscape and how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even if Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans want the ability to finish the job they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nCoverage the president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation and healthcare research organization\nWhat you're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nBlue Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance

than men to get punished for lesser violations of prison rolls\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's a sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shut\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women\nBut once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different\nInside the razor wire please looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don and helped us depending on what level there and that's the warden show Tom showing us around and see what we do that in a community of right now our for our outside and our yard within ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the warned as the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get discipline that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules\nThey're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch what NPR ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data for women to men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt and tie down and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she added copies day I have one\nThe word and show dumb in two thousand sixteen our data found\nSixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive now Don tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so special about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance\nLast [noise] tell me

she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nAnd trying to contribute as much as I can sit institution so I mean I saw a shame you know and it's helped me with my own my own shame than my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with\nRoom with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then right\nIf he runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in the basement sold his property\nVictims of satanic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims have even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now\nWomen can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it the Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for

relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close adviser and son in law during pushing her time with the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nNPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about pushing our role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously in both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first a Cushman he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted aside\nMotive this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires\nAre influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials\nOppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nAh to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and\nPresident Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear and some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he likes the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars in apartments from him and there had been reports are that Kushner a Christian or a pact or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's

candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican or states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has

wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see

remember that and I've got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and\nTo think folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my and I can tell you uh [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day and the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately\nWe're immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV T. Q. candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what a million discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about

which party wins control of Congress NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough

out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nAnd the content and laser focused on health care this year\nIt's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless at how Americans feel about the Affordable CARE Act there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it ...\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand\nOn the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare vice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization what you're\nLikely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermine the AC a\nBlue Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of Blue Cross Blue Shield
