realize that the the church was a bit torn about what was going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nWell actually some people from the church had reached out to me to say we're really struggling with this\nSo it took me a little bit about what some of those issues were that it's bringing up what were some other conversations that people had been having about this before\nThe allegations on Dr Ford's allegations came up people were saying they had already we're already kind of struggling it how do they keep in this kind of spiritual commute\nCommunity or you know keeping a community when they were already had political issues with some of the things that were coming out about\nUm judge Kavanaugh whether it you know maybe things they hadn't paid attention to before you know some of his writings

women bringing forward allegations that it'll be interesting to see how they are going forward now that he's been confirmed\nHow do people see church there\nAnd I think it's less than sacrament is

Indonesia\nThe state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year\nA spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote insurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote\nBut critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could faced persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James Wally Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nInvestor Brewster thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had\nFirst hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognize how did you navigate that\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse\nWe were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is our main objective was to make sure that he had the fool\nImmunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely us other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized officially as a spouse would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president in the first flight of the Dominican Republic because\nRepublic because of that non recognition as a spouse or and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight to make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to social aspects as well as legal aspects\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nThe state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify for dependent these is now the Trump Administration says as as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that comprise two different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either they're an apt and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from this administration and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U. S.\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage\nBut you're you're not allowing that person who was a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship in so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get a visa the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow and figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two

NPR News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week\nIn connection with the killing of the teenager outlook on McDonald's\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nAnd violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria have felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off who says investors sent this something of says\nSo from my perspective it's fairly well Dr phil fan they're winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I've often there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know whether it's some turn that we as saying that it's dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most\nThe most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily it just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more of them will she is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whether the handling you know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and on traffic stops I'm no longer the\nMost frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it if it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to oppress the police are biased or racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years is on the police and United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus that triggering event then you have the the cut us off it got to come\nSo somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court\nYou think police officer is pushing back to demonstrate to us so somebody looking at police officers identify them as part of this ... this part of the government that are demonstrating against\nSo it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because they cannot take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government with the police so\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the activities is definitely a training issue offices frequently a sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feels\nFeel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that that\nAlways a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment get benefit and political development that might be putting their life in danger so this tactical issue is how we approach and the problem and how you go to the house\nA well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous the problem is that we have eight thousand police agencies and when you have eight in South ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us\nMitigate the negative and of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's up to talk on the acceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty of an outcome most premeditated activity that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate the incidents killed by members of the topic this is absolutely can accept\nThat as
