teams have not met in the world series since clean sixteen and guess who pitched game show a vaccine for the Boston Red\nSo these two teams have not met in the world series since Nineteen sixteen\nAnd guess who pitched game to a vet game for the Boston Red Sox who Babe Ruth may never know Babe Ruth you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees that's how far back these this go okay with them\nAnd they matched up so it was it's also even though it's it's this historic\nMatchup it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team somehow they miss each other when they both and in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them to two thousand Eighteen\nSo looking back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case it just got it torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games but it went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've met with the team in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said or either he's at shortstop they lost Corey secret during the season so now they have a child and then\nReally is there a case I Know it's not Clinton ... its Walker viewer so adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honestly one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had definitely Boston is that a lot of reason to celebrate but even the patriots and the red Sox but this team is arguably one of the best\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and

their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody yeah that's the question right\nFour months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously they should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and their reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where are these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor facilities all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents had criminal background what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with\nWith their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the farm we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us thanks for having me [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychics who take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

minority communities\nShe's the head of then why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right\nVoting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations close polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set for through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn his role in some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having\nThe voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processes we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rules\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturn now or it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law that is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota\nSo some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much uh but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place [noise]\nYou know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project

I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child and\nAgain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because we've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child not because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over ... killed 'em killed and this is a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under standard child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\n[noise] the ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us\nThe one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining thanks for having me [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYour listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychic to take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

between the two countries\nUs we'll get a fighter jet tanks combat ships and more to the Persian Gulf Country all of it getting made in America\nThe government will have to hire more people can make all this new vehicle\nRemember NBS runs the defense minister\nSo he is able to deliver this very big promise to the president that Saudi Arabia will buy this many weapons so that's the point of the visit their locking in Mohammed bin Salman as their primary and to lock it or to the Saudis\nSo what happens after President Trump leave Saudi Arabia having strongly signaled that Mohammed bin Salman is his guy well the first\nThing that happens is that NBS is officially designated as the crown prince\n... and do we think those two things are related that has since President Trump has hand picked the leader of Saudi Arabia\nI think President Trump's endorsement of NBS certainly helped him this after all is Saudi Arabia is most important ally it's major economic partner and the source of foreign investment so getting the United states president\nTo give his stamp of approval to a future leader is a big deal for the Saudis\n[noise]\nThere were big changes in Saudi Arabia\nWomen are joining the what for seeing record numbers and then finally be allowed to drive up to more than two decades of protests\nAnd then ask crown prince NBS begins to deliver on his progressive\nVision fight Saudi standards the country's news crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is ... and it's not just women who feel more liberated you take a look at Saudi Arabia to stand up comedy see\nThat one

Riyadh and has a very splashy opulent conference devoted to ways in which Saudi Arabia is going to modernize\n[noise]\nSo from everything you're saying work\nThis looks like a very early trial for the Trump Administration in the world of foreign policy the president seems to have deeply influenced the choice of who will lead Saudi Arabia and that leader Mohammed bin Salman\nIs doing the kind of western style looking reforms that make the entire relationship look and feel the way we want it to\nYes for a new administration it was actually kind of a master stroke on the global stage and then things started going wrong\n... ... ... ... ...\nMohammed bin Salman picked a nasty squabble with his Persian Gulf neighbor cutter\nSaudi Arabia has closed Its Food and imposing its effect to feed the cage when is Neva [noise] the reason behind her cage conscious that gets ... pushing ... likes to collect Islamic state in Egypt form I ... the Muslim Brotherhood which ... nice\nHe in prison dozens of wealthy Saudis\nPalestine tree to the nth degree were say are truly historic upheaval unfold right now around France and the U.S rolled out a huge and frankly bizarre crackdown where he rounded up hundreds of members of the royal family and other rich Saudis\nAnd basically in jail them including torturing some of them in Riyadh the Ritz Carlton hotel\nAnd lots of them were forced to hand over tons of money to him\nHe called it an anti corruption campaign other people nearly called it a PR\nSaudi Arabia considers Canada's comments on human rights in the kingdom to be an interference in its affairs that requires what it calls a sharp response he picked an absolutely need literally diplomatic fight with the Canadians it all began with a tweet from Canada's foreign affairs ministry stating concerns\nHe picked an absolutely need later diplomatic fight with the Canadians\nIt all began with a tweet from Canada's foreign affairs ministry stating concerns over Saudi Arabia's arrest him rights activists and demanding their immediate release\nAnd then he kidnapped and detained the prime minister of Lebanon\nLebanon remains in a state of crisis more than a week after its prime minister sat out how to get a unexpectedly resigned while on a trip to Saudi Arabia Lebanon and president Michel ... and others have accused Saudi Arabia of kidnapping how to Eddie and forcing him to resign against his will\nHe engaged in a reckless war across the southern border in Yemen where Saudi led airstrikes have killed an untold number of civilians including many children\nThe Saudis enforce the blockade shutting down ports and border crossings preventing critical aid from getting to Yemen\nAnd lastly he hasn't bought the hundred and ten billion dollars worth of weapons from the United states that were promised back during President Trump's visit to Riyadh in fact up till now the Saudis have bought only about\nFourteen and a half billion of that hundred ten billion so this huge upside that the Trump Administration was promising has yet to materialize\n\nSo how is President Trump who has a bet on him as the western friendly reformer responding to these disappointing turns in this relationship\nPresident Trump for the most part has accepted if not endorsed some of these moods\nHe treated I have great confidence from king Solomon and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they are doing some of those very harshly treating have been milking their country for years lets\nThe White House put out a lengthy statement after the incident with the wealthy Saudis being locked up in the Ritz Carlton in which he effectively endorsed the prince and said he believed in what he was trying to do to clean up his kingdom he has not publicly chided him for the war in Yemen\nHe did ask him to try to resolve the dispute with cutter but when the Saudis basically defied him and continued with the blockade of cutter President Trump went quiet the Trump Administration seems willing to let the prince have plenty of leeway\nWhy would that be though you said earlier that the reason President Trump\nThe Trump Administration seems willing to let the prince have plenty of leeway\nWhy would that be though you said earlier that\nThe reason President Trump has that on and the U.S is that he provides the justification for the relationship he\nIs the best possible face for all the flaws in messiness of the Saudi Arabian United States alliance\nBut in these actions he seems to be emerging as a figure that would embarrass the United states so why would President Trump not attempt to exercise greater influence over his hand picked leader of Saudi Arabia after this series of events\nI think President Trump would argue that\nMohammed bin Salman needs the opportunity to establish himself to consolidate power\nHe's operating in a tough part of the world but above all I think the case he would make is that on the ultimate strategic issue of combating Iran which is the centerpiece of President Trump's Middle East strategy\nMohammed bin Salman is a critical player member in Yemen Saudi Arabia is fighting the who the rebels who these are backed\nBy Iran so it's important in the fight against Iranian proxies in the region to have Saudi Arabia support and so to the extent that Iran is really the big prize for President Trump Mohammed bin Salman is his wing man in that effort\n[noise] so what's the message that this inaction by President Trump sends to Muhammad than solving if he knows that so long as Iran is being taken care of everything else will more or less be forgiven\nWill the messages that he has a free hand to do whatever he wants and that is above all the message that NBS has taken for the last twelve months\n\nAnd that brings us to October
