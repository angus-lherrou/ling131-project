matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegate said that it stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right\nOccasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years that something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements don't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished\nBoats and actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first uh solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey aren't calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big

devise these two countries are above me is a sign that says the end of any of those from Mexico the entrance to Mexico but you can tell Mexican security forces are preparing because there are dozens of police in riot gear waiting here\nFor the eminent arrival of this caravan about five minutes down the bridge from where I'm walking is the central square where three to four hundred members of this migrant caravan are waiting for the rest of the arrive\nWho are these migrants where they coming from why are they coming\nSo most of the migrants that I spoke to her from Honduras or but also summer from El Salvador in Guatemala let's listen to Judy uh thirty four year old I spoke to in that central square as she was cradling her exhausted five year old son on her lap\n... and as a family thing to get us to say what he does what she said is that there's no safety no job no medicine and hospitals she also went on to say that hunters it feels like freedom of assembly an expression or being repressed\nBy the government of President Juan Orlando Hernandez she said it's just unlivable and Honduras for her right now some site violence is the main factor some sites poverty but\nThe people that I met are just absolutely desperate\nHas she or anybody else actually tried to cross onto the Mexican side of the border you\nKnow they are pretty dead set on crossing as a group and being a big visible force that tries to cross so they see strength and visibility in numbers\nNow I mentioned the Mexican position they're saying that only migrants with valid paperwork or going to be allowed to

while some malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers\nOver the last five years more malls have opened and closed ... as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere or triple lays or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are receiving the news of Sears demise\nTriple lays or super regionals as they referred to who are booming who are receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with glee because if Sears is still doing\nBusiness in in their facility they're happy to take the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tenant did and there are only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor star but they've got others can what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort of ... and then there are\nB and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older in many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... why can't they re imagine the space and add a food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what those

in the marketplace in virtually every major population center throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA centers that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined in what ways where it would be willing anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nAll the anchors store was typically a department store in the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending\nPart on its way out but now several things have happened first of all the apparel an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on tech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store right which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center\n[noise] do you go shopping malls regularly no fly\nWhen I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United

considerable potential for higher and better use than as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump

in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people [noise] it's almost finished as more\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the

as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is does the DNA test tell him what his identity as her tell any of us what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times note and said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves or an how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right um they are also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take serious way on the
