fell eight hundred thirty\nOne points which is a three percent declined here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie hey John I also so what parts of the market scientists plummet today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of a this um market but ah all of the uh all sectors really were down uh\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of these talk gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and ... and as I said I just wanted the foundations of the market in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the S. and P. five hundred which also has a lot of tech\nLost three and a third percent so it was a tough day day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm now I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate and the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rated between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fear it's going on\nWell well there are but interest rates are fears contributed to do this a rage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable\nA and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually\nAnd as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go out there are a some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more inflation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market what happened\nThe economy is strong in the U.S and most accommodated are saying today shell of his not the end of a double marketing stocks so a while the U.S economy\nWhile the U.S economy remains strong um Europe is cool to bed and so ever merging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago and of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting\nA the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nSo what we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend well most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling\nToward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are a are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months or two a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie thanks time You're welcome [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into his gentle last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day\nThat same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that fate is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill and individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture a show not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this is U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of love what Saudi officials discussing this Yogi\nCorrect this is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on the show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said\n... and effectively said we know which are up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think\nThere's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership and Saudi Arabia when\nYou talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme Court\nCan't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision\nBut abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm has passed\nAt the market north apartment complex in Wilmington you haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate\nMoving on to it without a where to go to\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give it to displace

opened back up that Tuesday for the public after the hurricane 'em by\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked at a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few\nDays to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get 'em by\nSo it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or\nOr your business FEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hope to disapprove that prediction but it's too soon to tell

ashore but there are some serious implications 'em down along the coast where where the storm came in it picked up even more steam and intensified before it came ashore\nThe wins cause significant

meet the seams safety standards as other cars on the rally and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal face\nFederal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nRegulars who started the gym and between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines\nA few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified and if you add the exits and be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is sometimes I'm the value of some of those Lindsey\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be nationwide term jumper regulations that make sure that these vehicles are up to be in the streets are wanting\nSome stretch Leno's are safer than others he says companies can do hold tests where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something the force of the impact you can see for if if they're not taught when we installed with certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say limos often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and ... says\nSome of the public not care about ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nThink it's this really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I just\nThe I think most people assume that if they're in the business that that there are minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issue to call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLevine of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of movement out of D.C having states will lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened

gradually and it has suggested it was stopped rising benchmark rate between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get\nThere so the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation right right or their ears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair a drone Paul has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation\nPressures so you're saying the economy remains strong ... good for the stock market\nEconomy is strong in the U.S and most commentators are are are saying today sell off is not the end of the bull market in stocks here

particular area is that the market that had been hurt by a sell off\nFor virtually all sectors of the markets sold off today of wiping out all the stock gain since mid summer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market\nBall market in fact uh the tech heavy NASDAQ index lost four percent of its value today and that's and the five hundred which also has a lot of tech lost three and a ... percent so it's been a very\nTough day for tech a very tough day but is it just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market while most analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to eight hundred and thirty points down\nWas due to a machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling\nA given the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down\nBut we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession we're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough\nThat the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks\nWill see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the U.S market will have another\nCrack at it and we'll see what happens will say that NPR's John Ydstie Thanks John You're welcome\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIn Wyoming state officials are proposing new rules to limit methane emissions the big oil and gas state is doing this as the Trump Administration has relaxed its own set of rules and as a un climate report urges countries to dramatically cut greenhouse gases\nFrom Wyoming Public radio and NPR's energy and environment team Cooperman Kim reports\nA decade ago Pinedale, Wyoming had a big problem with methane it's an area with a lot of oil and gas in weeks we're creating smog\nNearby schools kept certain kids inside during recess some days residents complained of headaches deep hole remembers going cross country skiing and senior brown tinge in the air we spoke last year\nSo I remember I was in bed for a week or so which something like the flu it felt like but it didn't seem like the flu\nMethane produced ozone was above legal limits so\nWyoming agency eventually required stricter guidelines and it did at lower emissions but only in that small area but with federal rules uncertain Wyoming has decided it needs to do more than you\nNeeds to do more named you offer them at a recent public hearing residence debated a proposal to expand the state's regulations on missions including messing since oil and gas is in nearly every county Don Duncan says she feels the effects\nAre half\nTime not in\nThe conversation around a stricter statewide methane rule suddenly seems more urgent with the Trump administration's rollback John ... is with the Environmental Defense fund\nIt's going to leave eastern Wyoming where eighty percent of the drilling in Wyoming is currently happening without the benefit of these measures\nWhich he says it's worrisome with thousands of new wealth plan to come online seem in Wyoming proposed changes would mimic a central part of Obama era messy and rules\nSemi annual inspections for oil and gas in search of invisible leaks that emit methane Wyoming would join only two other states with comprehensive methane emissions rules California and Colorado at Wyoming's department of environmental quality Nancy beer says the proposed rules are needed regardless the federal role backs\nWere doing this because it's the right thing to do for Wyoming under our technical analysis of all the information yeah\nSurprisingly the oil and gas industry which opposed the Obama administration's federal regulations supports the state's\nMoves on a windy day at a productive five acre well pad superintendent tray Web of world energy partners says regular inspections catching natural gas leaks be no problem [noise]\nWalking up a metal stairway to massive oil storage tank he says they've already caught leaks using a special infrared camera it'll\nIdentify any problems that you can't see you know just with the naked eye or or being able to hear it or something\nSomebody president Peter ... says he had invested in more expensive equipment when federal regulation went into place but he says it's worth it to keep soluble gas leak\nOne basic research\nWe want to sell all this gas when artists have vetted\nIn fact she's twenty Thirteen the U.S has missed out on over two billion dollars worth of leaks natural gas\nBut the Trump Administration argues that captured natural gas would not pay off that compliance and implementation is too expensive in any case ... prefers answering Wyoming\nWe're always believed that the closer regulation the individual whether it's from the county or from the state it's better\nIt's better than having it regulated by the government\nBetter rushing to the central mania and Virginia are also working on their own methane regulations meanwhile it's not clear if the federal backs actually happened they face legal challenges for NPR News I'm Cooper McCann this is all things considered from NPR News\nPeople that are watching in might think oh if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if

like literally really having you and I'm like oh my God\nLike [laughter] like an ice freezes myself like some boy was like come here and I would like I don't\nLike you really got to get away from me like this is not okay and I was like oh my God like people really go through this and people sometime\nAre like they're like stuck like my son was like yo one time I had this experience with some girl was like they came up to her and she was like in a all like she couldn't move she was like scared to move like that's just\nMe and I think that's the crazy because it's like you're saying that this is so common this sort of thing happens all the time and it's so normalized just like let's say ... calling\nThat's normal like it's so normal to I\nLiterally been ... I think the youngest I've been ... probably when I was like ten yeah through not twelve Thirteen and it's just so\nCommon and not one of us who his cat called makes quote unquote a big deal about it because we know that it will continue to happen no matter how much we speak up about it\nHow many of you have\nOr their spirit and something along the lines of what Christine Blasey Ford testify to or have a friend who told you something\nHappened that made them very uncomfortable\nOne two three four five six seven\nEight I\nWho who\nBeen sexually assaulted for half an race and they still like even if they don't remember the horse\nEven if they don't remember the whole scenario was always like once Mexican things that they remember that even to roost day like it makes their skin color can affect some mentally so much like what she said that was the one thing that always affected her ... laugh\nKnow I have friends that have had something like this happens to them or worse and they've only gone to me and a select group of people about it because of the fear that nobody's going to believe them that their parents are going to be angry at them for whatever reason\nTo have you find that you wanted to talk about any of these encounters and you found the people around you weren't believing them or the questions that made you wonder if they believe Jew or you're just fell on a nerd\nHowever\nUm I've always wanted to talk about it and I have like I've gone to my mother and talked about what has happened to me but when I told her she said should have been like ... that late where you should have came straight home and so I kinda stopped telling people who I wanted to tell like my other family like close friends of mine because I felt as if\nMy feelings and what has happened to me was invalidate it in that\nAre you comfortable saying anything more about what happened to you don't have to\nI was walking home from an evening out with my friends it was around like maybe nine thirty ten and I was walking and a man who I didn't know he was a silly old man and he approached me\nAnd I first I thought it was like super funny all of a sudden against because he'd been pushed me said\nOh you look like a sexy Britain and I'm like I don't know what that means like ha ha but then he like pulled me into like it wasn't like his house for like the driveway mixes house\nAnd he pulled me there and I started to get scared I tried to fight back but I was not as strong as him and he was a very\nLike um he was very boat and\nThen like started to like try to kiss on my neck and tried to like touch my books and I got so uncomfortable but I was capable of getting out of that situation because of a stranger that was walking past and I started screaming for help but feel that to this day I kind of I'm Still impacted by it\nBecause when people even go near me I'm Still like\nI don't want you to get them very uncomfortable and you just\nYou chose to tell your parents and people around you about it and and\nI took my mother as soon as I got home 'cause after the incident I kind of like ran home today I guess there was adrenalin I usually don't run\nBut there was a gentleman that was running and as soon as I got home my mom started like why are you home silly and I'm like this is what happened to me she said you shouldn't have been out too late and I said I kinda just stopped talking about it\n\nSo I Want to shift focus here to to pre sensitive question especially given what we just heard\nOne of the conversations surrounding these accusations against\nBrett Kavanaugh is that\nThis was high school so how much weight should it carry given that context and I'm curious what you think it's high schoolers\nShould what you do now should what anyone in high school does now follow you around for the rest of your life\nYeah yeah because I feel like like obviously I was like a rite of passage and you've got to make mistakes and learn your way through it but there are certain things that it's just like\nLike saying hateful things to certain minority groups and things like sexual conduct that kinda stuff followed the victim forever to follow the victims for every well then you got to do with it too that it's your fault you know what I mean\nWhen you're sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year in high school you have a moral compass that will tell you what is right and what's wrong so\nIf you're already in the state of ... what are you know what's right and what's wrong I mean you were consciously making a decision to do something wrong or you were conscious and making a decision do something right what does the same thing going to be doing the rest of your life mhm\nI Wonder what you think the message was when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed many of you have talked about the experiences they happen to you or to people you know that\nWe're a salt and given the fact that he was accused of that and he was put on to the nation's highest court what's the message to you\nFor all we know it could have never happened but the fact just so the fact that he was accused shows that anybody can get away with anything as long as they have enough power off of that\nOh I have people that um\nThat are watching him might think oh if he got away with that I tend to because if he did it\nMaybe I'm not going to get caught maybe like even if they bring me to like a trial like I'm I'm going to be good because look who is now our Supreme Court justice he got away with it so I don't mean to me\nIt's kind of just feels like a bagel out really care about your situation type of things from like the higher up than the government and stuff it felt like we don't care if you like it or not you have to take it and like it feels like they don't care about our opinion or safety is the fact that we're even here\nEven though we make up like a big\nPercentage of people and it feels like they're kind of just like well suck\n\nReally want to thank you
