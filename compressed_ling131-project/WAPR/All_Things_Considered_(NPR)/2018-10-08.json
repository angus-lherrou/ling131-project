considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting you to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there was some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is parental\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able\nBeing able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as real as\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people have color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo easily win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use of technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are Alice\nO'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nSupport for

News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media post on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who had famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is this the Taylor Swift make some political endorsement\nHonestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops Instagram posed with really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people that would really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she would secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that their them disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still dry\nWhich still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and she'd have a broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has those country than she did still want you to appeal to them but I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd this is what I've been trained as the mystery of the day and I always had that I had her mind summit laid back Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for joining us today eight thank

bitterness very real [noise]\n\nInside it was the Supreme Court we're used to it's quiet stayed ceremonial and in a Supreme Court conference whom attended by very few people aside from justice Kevin or his family and half a dozen justices you sworn into and joins the Supreme Court\nMm\n\nAdam with Kevin not now Supreme Court justice I Want to ask you about the damage that may have been done to the court as a result of the past few weeks the idea that this process has undermined the court impartiality what about this process may have damaged the court in that way\nSo this was a great victory for Republicans and conservatives that was bad for Democrats and liberals who was terrible for the Supreme Court the Supreme Court's power rests on perception\nAnd that people think it deserves to be respected that people think they will get a fair shake their and this\nProcess in which the Supreme Court seat was treated really by ... it out on me as a political prize\nThis whole two week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political ...\nAnd where the nominee used harshly partisan language\nRevenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nReally cast the court in a political light where for it to be respected it needs to be thought to be illegal institution devoted discerning in applying neutral principles of law and not and working on politically partisan lines and this entire experience the devastating damage to that immigration\nThis is a shark is\nThe consequences will stand long past my nomination the consequences will be with us for decades\nIt may be that he was a conservative to begin with and he's going to vote and the conservative direction but it may also be that this experience\nWhich was dealt with very hard for him not something any of us would like to endure true or false accusations of this kind of misconduct are deeply deeply upsetting saved and understand that it might\nAnd bitter him and people fear that maybe it makes them even more conservative than you otherwise would have been\nDrawing comparisons to Justice Clarence Thomas who faced allegations of sexual harassment in Nineteen Ninety One where he was conservatives to start out with but it's at least possible that the bitterness that lingered for his confirmation hearings caused him to be what he's become which is the most conservative justice in modern memory\nAnd do we have any evidence to suggest that that's what happened\nOr Clarence Thomas was devastated by his second Senate confirmation hearings where he was answering allegations of sexual harassment and in his memoir my grandfather's son he tells the story of hearing the final Senate vote he was taking a long hot bath to try to decompress\nAnd someone comes in and says Clarence congratulations you're on the Supreme Court and he says whoop de damn do where do I go to get my reputation back it's not\nWorth it he didn't think he would ever really recover from those hearings and they couldn't help influencing the kind of judge he would come on the court\nHe would come on the court\nIt certainly is consistent with the fact that with few exceptions he never asked questions he doesn't give us in the press the satisfaction of getting that public sense of him and there's a sense in which he's saying I'll do the job but I'm not planning well\nSo you said that the Supreme Court's power rests on perception what's the difference between justice cabinet or Justice Thomas carrying some kind of partisan animosity with\nThem versus a perception that say\nIt's one thing for it to be true and it's another thing for people to think to be true right or the public pays very little attention to the Supreme Court and when it occasionally wakes up and typically during confirmation hearings and here's wait a second this is not only about law there's a political element to it\nThe Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop when the court issues a big decision like the twenty twelve decision upholding Obamacare\nEven people who were prove to the decision but thought the court was being political and how it acted the Supreme Court's public approval ratings drop so to the extent the court is viewed as political even if it really is even if people who follow it closely no it to be\nThat perception is very harmful to the court\nWell what are the risks of a court\nThat doesn't have the credibility I mean\nWhat are some of the practical ways in which a court that somehow doesn't seem as legitimate loses its place in our system\nWhere the risk is simple the risk is they will order someone to do something perhaps President Trump perhaps someone else\nAnd that person will say why should I and that's happened on occasion in the nation's history Andrew Jackson famously refused to follow a court directive there were questions about how southern politicians were following brown v board of education school desegregation is\nJustice Breyer likes to tell the story that he wakes up the day after Bush ... which the two thousand case that ended the presidency to George W. Bush\nAnd he thought the decision was badly wrong but he was ...\nThat the country did with the court said he should do lots of other countries all over the world there are Supreme courts they issued decrees and people from their noses at it so the danger is that this vital institution to American democracy loses its footing loses its place\nTo the power of the United States Supreme court rats almost entirely\nIn trust in it it is not gas\nIt is not guaranteed to anybody including Congress or the president or a state has to abide by its ruling\nHere it's it's like the wizard of Oz you don't want to be behind the curtain because the whole thing is built on faith and if you lose their faith and if it's thought to be just a third political branch of government we may be in deep trouble\nI feel the nine justices of the Supreme Court may not appreciate that particular metaphor of ...
