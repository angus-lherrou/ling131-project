network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand then there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those billions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of ...\nAnd full of dirt you'd see was built
