California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repeal neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now but California has gone through what has the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom

of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThe Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then a little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of ...\nPeople who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nA ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades gotten extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather\nSo it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem when the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits rocky whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme and his administration and the way is running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experience profession\nExperienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out of ... people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half\nOf the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended this book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this act of destruction would come and kind of ease or pain she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd which he doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her born is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\nIt imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis whose new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow

moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a sun dabbled press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president assure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital

that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court

include things like zero rating which is a deal wherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix store data just restrictions and these are all\nRules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what does the reaction but\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or video streaming video\nSaying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies on the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your column cats that\nHave been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California's don't go to the rest of the nation\nHow the world at Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing California legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect in January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level uh the tech companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorneys general including in California attorney general are suing the fed\nGeneral are suing the Federal Communications commission trying to on\nRules the repeal of the Obama era rules so all of this is kind of in the hands of the courts are and we're waiting to see how that plays out and say thank you [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n... junior

video which was quickly released and went viral and you can see on his face that Senator Flake is grim faced staring down at the floor of the elevator trying not to sort of catch their gaze at one point one of the women says\n\nLook at me don't look away when I'm Talking to you and he glances are crushed fall and then you can see the weight of this decision that he had already struggled with for the last week or more absolutely come crashing down on him\nIt was clear I think to everybody that watched that video that however difficult the decision had been for Senator Flake up until that moment it was immensely more difficult for him after that episode\nAnd respond [noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] in terms of having maximum impact it couldn't have been times better [noise] and it is certainly true that members of Congress get feedback all the time they get feedback from constituents they get phone calls that come into their offices so it's not true that they are complete\nTrue that they're completely isolated from what real people think but there's also usually a distance rate especially when you're at the Capitol when you're in Washington\nLawmakers sit up on the diet is in the hearing room they are both above the audience and distance from the audience and the discussions about public policy\nAnd these big momentous decisions they have to make are often done among themselves and out of the direct contact from the people that they're going to affect and this was a reminder for obviously Senator Flake but also for the rest of us watching it that\nThere really isn't as much distance as we think between the decisions that the politicians we elect to make and the people who they affect\nSo after when I'm sure felt like attorney to Senator Flake he sort of escape this element or the doors close and he has you know this year in\nWhat's going on in that [noise]\nSo the hearing has just been gaveled to order by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa Republicans

went to a democratic senator it goes back and forth each appointment to our nation's highest court as with all others simply too important to rush to vote\nBut even as the back and forth is happening the Democrats are waiting for some kind of a delay\nYou investigate it's the least thing a sexual assault victim is entitled to when she comes forward\nThey don't understand why an FBI investigation
