go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for\nThe twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they want him to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the code or is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered that same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter the most are the
