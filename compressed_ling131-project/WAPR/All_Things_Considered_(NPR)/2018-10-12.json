Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent\nHere's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg I'm Mary Louise said tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood at\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the there's also in that area there's a causeway the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane\nBut that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help ya\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them right\nMean ... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf but also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi whole they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escaped major dam\nThe daily weekdays is thirty pm on a PR [noise]\nNo rain in the forecast

considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nToday in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's passed around a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies in Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judges basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron\nReal tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development of breaks or and us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just symbols taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWhere it can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into what they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd a trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nFreaked does and I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do as well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know one of them um because the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us ...\nHere's and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset just more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking going category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the\nIndicator from Planet Money [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer live a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News I'm\nRecovering after Michael will have the latest on the storm that devastated parts of the south east blush of Nineteen Ninety six fire destroyed the LA public libraries Susan Orlean on the on the shoulder mystery that didn't just destroy books\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to see if this deters the Russians in any way\nNPR's Greg Myre thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no alternative conclusion other than the Russians face was ... years I'm ... back in September of British author\nThirties held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nThat is likely so they were traveling underwriters says ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called battling cat his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it\nSomething like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works\nPolar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations unfold on social media in Venezuela pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through in kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they liked photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up all of the photo shows are boy ... 'em up on the wall\nColonel ana totally ... the spitting image of demand and the photo released by the British right there on the wall with his name's spelled out for all to see in Bellingham turned

listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player as she is right the athletic Rand Paul Knight is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat with this you that was made famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and\nTo hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball shoe at him\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they earn just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broken every two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years though when I think when you look at basketball basketball though with the elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so a coma\nAnd with a big part of the appeal with tapping in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being the global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and the prime gene it's ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year Nike had about ... percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough to bind okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old darned about end to mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball ... business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that in mid may kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west and the more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting she banned in what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on his ... and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at Pomona signed\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really lenient on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages\nFacing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be used for sure\nNick DiPaolo covers the athletic she industry for ESPN

com\n[noise] and from the sustaining members of this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News\nConsidered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWill colonel worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is and the knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal release today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurors\nIn another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat would that's completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turn fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally these institutions were\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigates the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment in that probe\nMoron last one we succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had a real difficulty and doing its workers ... hadn't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map in our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referrals to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the water ... a year to that was very interesting I when I asked you to load that was set up to the house I they ...\nSaid no Bates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringement ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but\nThere's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nTwenty first century variation of the Silk Road that is something that the lower team destroy likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was\nSquirrels who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's

the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years\nI think the fed has gone crazy I think the fed is out of control of what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush to president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private\nPrivate lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials happened defending said from the president attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question he's right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always in the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and held sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nAre no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them from\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think\nIs very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe comes right it could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nUnderstanding that's Donald

today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they are the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo we drove into day my producer Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region\nIn this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was

no outside help you\nWhile and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely to moral as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly had been convicted up\nHis pastor around a small church and is near and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames for that to attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless\nThe charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen a\nPresident ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment the ...\nCase that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nCan take max you manage to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ...\nTen rules reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he has Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co hosts of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note lifted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that's in a bag of free to Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do is well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more we just the cheap\nMore with just the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies are one of them um because the parents have gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nBacking category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie task the\nIndicator from Planet Money [noise] support for planet\nMoney comes from transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ...\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News I'm\nAfter Michael will have the latest on the storm that devastated parts of the south east Bush of Nineteen Ninety six fire destroyed the LA public libraries Susan Orlean on the lungs old mystery that didn't just destroy books libraries feel like these\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians\nSee if this detour as the Russians in any way and parents garden Ira thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA problem is is that there is no tentative conclusion other than the Russians fake was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIt is likely so they were traveling underwriters says I'm visa ...\nTo a guy like Eric told her that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling cat\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy and you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of rushing just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up all of the photo shows are boy ...

me [noise] if you have your listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season tips off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player that's yeah that's right the athletic Rand Paul Knight is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nThat was a shoe that was made famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry [noise]\nAthletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been like Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Nineteen Ninety eight and it was very short lived they had signed just one clear and been quarter and yoga broken after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball's always had these these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has and so a coma that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players of today that are young and trend setting and exciting and and also\nI think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being the global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and it didn't they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and the prime gene is ... even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdles for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike had about sixty percent of the leak wearing their shoes last oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance from corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an old aren't into mark his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the ... is a big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media is she's gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have said could see that in ... made a kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of them are\nKind of immersing more and what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram or things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun they have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's why this huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really leaning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes so much Nick ... thanks [laughter]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\nA lot of companies about
