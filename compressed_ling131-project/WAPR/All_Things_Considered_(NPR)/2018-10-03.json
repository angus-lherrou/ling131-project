Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor also are now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government wise so I'm prepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children nor did he even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nIt means ration has abandoned\nSee of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents to talk more about the d._a. jets inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose hey Joel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important in it that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children and border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nA central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd then what happened to those families\nGovernment was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower and the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration is\nPort made no effort to identify those young children in any way no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose

her inbox\nOf them in her inbox and her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica has to be about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry ... someone and did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\n... is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well [noise] I did get responses\nFrom people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that [noise] you know it just just\nThinking about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can ever make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on a spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on the spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women\n[noise] can you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to\nThat you have to call him since it was published this week [noise] [noise]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response drop please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her had this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi well\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for daughters to tell her father is about the sort of have a better understanding of what women go through I\nThink so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing and the the Kavanaugh Ford hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how victims should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who is\nYour life that you're close to who have said I grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there is evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nFor having me Ari in New York Times story you gets hurt it now says Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it and then the as Jim Zarroli reports regulators where either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources\nWe lacked the resources to do so real estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax bonding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating it toward gift tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions involving the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBecause Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it NYU's Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe assess\n... says it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York [noise]\nAnd you're listening to all things

shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just the motor users can do as a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some\nHow the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her votes now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him\nHim but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he

... they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children and border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could was with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nHa chess by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAt Central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents\nHis parents couldn't communicate with their kids\nAt all then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no risk bans and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still hadn't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Jill you're walking [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMontana has become a popular campaign stop for President Trump and vice president Pence so popular that each of them has been there twice in recent months that's because Republicans are trying to unseat two term democratic Senator Jon tester\nDuring ... second visit there yesterday he fired up a rally talking about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports\nIn a state that President Trump won by more than twenty points Chester emphasizes that you can work with Trump he's run an ad listing Nineteen bills he supported the Trump is sign so when vice president Pence spoke in Bozeman yesterday he painted tester as a reliable and reflexes member of the Democratic resistance\nOf the Democratic resistance\nEvil or the latest allegations that fully investigated\nSaturday does already now voting no on your L just like even though we're\nTester didn't take a position on Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh citing first his record on privacy issues and support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge go I don't think he\nHas the merits nor the background to\nUh meet the needs of the Supreme Court\nRepublican challenger Matt Rosendale says he'd be a more reliable ally for President Trump and sided the Supreme Court vote as an example\nMyself and a lot of people across this nation or very disturbed with the way this entire process was handled there is a man who has a commendable record and\nHe should be serving on the bench and absolutely I Would vote for him\nOn paper standing firmly with President Trump would appear to be a winning strategy in Montana the population here skews older and wider than us in general Montana also has the second highest population of veterans per capita of any state guys\nLike Jim hunting film [noise]\nRetired after Twenty years in the navy ending felt now volunteers at the airport in Missoula helping arriving tourists he voted for President Trump\nGonna mess around with this country we're going to do something as no crosses the line a red line we're going to do\nWhile heading failed says he hell no didn't vote for President Obama like many Montana voters he isn't easy to pigeon hole\nHe says he's voted for Chester before and for Democratic governors Steve bullock in twenty sixteen and he says a candidate support for the president or testers vote on Kavanaugh's nomination won't sway his choice\nNo because I don't use as a platform to make my decision\nStill plenty of voters do see their vote as a sign of support for President Trump\nBozeman retirees Suzie burden was at a senior community center yesterday near where vice president Pence was holding his campaign rally\nWell I think a pressing doing marvelously actually he keeps his promises\nAnd not many of them do\nPresident Trump is front and center in the Senate race here identity and look\nRaise your identity and local issues also matter for example tester who's put Rosendale on the defensive about whether a national forest in Montana could be privatized Rosendale initially opposed federal land ownership but says he's now convinced that that's not what people want\nAnd test her leans hard on his image as a third generation farmer Rosendale moved to the state in two thousand two after a career as a Maryland real estate developer voters will be watching closely Saturday as the to debate one last time before early voting starts later this month\nFor NPR News I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula, Montana [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News\n\nJ.

forty years plus or tradition by declining to release and he has his tax returns\nClearly his tax returns tell a story that the American people\nDeserve and need to know that is\nRemoved from the public record\nOne of the main tools that we have traditionally used to scrutinize the finances of our presidents\nAnd I'm at some point or they came over to me told me they had this thing they want to talk about and we went into a small room\nAnd what was it like to see those tax papers for the first time\nIt was totally\nFor the New York times published three pages from the candidates Nineteen Ninety five tax returns they showed Trump declared a nearly nine hundred and sixteen million dollar loss\nThese three pages were just like goals because they were the only glimpse we had into what he told the IRS about his well a loss\nOf over a hundred million dollar almost a billion dollars in a single year for\nThat moment ... looking and starting to feel more and more layers of the story of Donald Trump money\nMay have heard we've got some significant breaking news tonight\nIs tonight so six months later and march to thousands Seventeen Donald Trump is president and Rachel Maddow late in the day sent out a tweet saying she's got a copy of Donald Trump's tax returns\nWe have his federal tax return for one here for two thousand five and so we were all like holy cow or if you add up the lines for any kind of he made more than a hundred and fifty million dollars and not lawful tough fit\nRaise interesting questions to us\nThe partial talks between that we had from Nineteen Ninety five showed that he was bleeding money by two thousand and five it showed that he was making significant amounts of money so we started trying to figure out\nHow does the guy go from having a loss of nine hundred million dollars plus in Nineteen Ninety five\nTo booking a hundred and fifty million dollars in income in two thousand and five what's going on was there something extraordinary that happened in his life that year and then we came across this little smattering of clips that mention that in two thousand for\nDonald Trump and his siblings that sold their fathers real estate empire Brooklyn for over six hundred million dollars and that that's interesting\nAnd it made us want to learn everything we possibly could about that particular empire\nAnd we started reaching out to people who have been involvement empire disputes with it worked for\nTrying to reconstruct a fifty year history of red Trump in New York City\nWe started going through these documents previously unseen documents and then we called people again and again and eventually we're left with a detailed view of Fred Trump's empire no one had ever seen before\nSo tell me about Fred Trump\nDonald Trump father Fred Trump was born in Nineteen oh five from the Bronx the son of immigrants and Fred it a very young age becomes enamored with the construction business just sort of an incredible thing by the time he was Fifteen or sixteen\nHe started building how is it not just like as a construction worker like overseeing the whole thing [noise]\nA day off days for America and our ally\nThen when World War two and we saw to rush out the name was wanting this world and touch off celebrations throughout the country\nThere's this huge demand for housing for returning veterans\nNone of them are for developers low cost loan to encourage them set of eyes I'm In the buildings\nBy some in the building blocks of middle class housing Fred Trump became one of the country's largest recipients those federally subsidized building\nAnd he immediately launched on making these huge projects with low interest government guaranteed loans and keeping the costs so low that he was guaranteed a life of extraordinary well [noise]\nSo as you're going through all of Fred Trump's documents at what point does Donald Trump up here\nDonald Trump starts to show up in his father's business affairs when he's three years old in Nineteen forty nine\nSo what the documents reveal to us was that when Donald Trump was three years old he was actually read Trump's landlord\nFred Trump gives his children the land under these massive apartment projects that he's built and then begins pain them\nRent and as we begin tracking those payments we see that those payments may Donald Trump the equivalent of a millionaire and today's dollars by age nine and things just keep\nComing Adam [noise]\nNineteen sixty eight to graduate from college and he lands frightened to cause she job at his father's company for the salary Fred Trump found a way to make Donald Trump one of his bankers he got consulting fees for doing things for his father he released a car for you felt this first offices in Manhattan for\nThe also found ways to give him the laundry revenue from his building and then in Nineteen Seventy six you see this article\nAnd the New York times he took the New York times reporter on a tour of what he was describing as his empire showing this reporter\nAll the things he's done all the things he's built all of his jobs this building in this building and you must build a what we now know from looking at these records is if it was all his father's empire his father's success and he was just appropriating all of that has his own to build his own sort\nOf like the first instance where you just see the lie begins\nThank you Mr Trump for joining us this morning I then I have heard that you are worth something like three billion\nIt seemed like in the Nineteen eighties Everytime you turn on the TV I I've always said you know money isn't it totally essential ingredient but it does make it easier she was there he's young\nHe has certain good Los Angeles which is that point in time when Donald Trump begins to realize\nI can say almost anything burgers or you smarter than most people who call themselves entrepreneurs and it will come due to your benefit to my image and my reputation and I can make\nMoney off of that reputation as well that's an interesting question I don't know if anyone ever asked a question in my smarter than other people he's able to convince the bankers to given these tremendously outsized\nLoans face just on the image to miss that he's built for himself already\nAnd one thing that we found that I don't think anybody ever knew before is that his father goes along with the ride on some of that [noise]\nSo one of the revelations that we came across in the documents was how Fred and Donald Trump\nCoordinated stock purchases together for example in the late Nineteen eighties Donald made a public comment that he was going to take over time Inc magazine publishing company his father did buy stock right before Donald made those comments a week later sold it and he wound up making forty thousand dollars just on his son's hot air\nBase when it was very clear manifestation of these two guys executing\nFinancial strategies together it was more than just a father son relationship they were trying to achieve something together in terms of elevating the idea of Donald Trump as self made\nBillionaire this goes on for years but by Nineteen Ninety all of his ... he was just buried in debt casinos are failing businesses are failing what we found and what people haven't known before\nIs the degree to which is father\nHelped him out of that whole loan after loan after loan he ... his father down point in time somewhere between Fifteen and twenty five million dollars that he never talked about and that he wasn't paying back when he gets down at one point to just having a couple of million dollars in the bank and he's burning through more than that every month\n\nSo in the course of our reporting we've learned that in Nineteen Ninety and it's just really dark period in Donald Trump's life he makes an aggressive play to get more control of his father's well\nIt's one of the most remarkable discoveries remain on the way\nThe daily it's supported
