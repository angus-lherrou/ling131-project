Ehrlich at the company my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA from more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in that debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of victims reality so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once we moved into that debate as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS than you did multiples because I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological record you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on the national institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get your premium although you can catch criminals with these techniques but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either do commit\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration that lift their DNA behind a wheel K really he's foreign government of going through exploited the technique\nTo identify us I think that for their own purposes so there are many scenarios that you can think about me even\nNow many people defending use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... labs which helps police solve crimes is way we're working on these cases\nWe're working on these cases that you haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific murders of children things like that it just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousin for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused\nRob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero with fascinated in El Salvador in Nineteen eighty Romero was a dedicated champion of the poor and marginalized tomorrow the Catholic Church will make him things you can hear that story tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWell much of the country was focused on me Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight last week first lady Melania Trump was in Africa she's just back her first big solo trip overseas\nShe went on a story in Kenya she stopped by the pyramids in Egypt she also visited babies in a hospital in Guyana and schoolchildren in Malawi CNN reporter Kate Bennett was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now Hi Kate how\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for\nThe exactly this was her first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak\nAnd what was the agenda [noise] well I mean she says she was\nThere to spread the message about the best which is her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with usa ID\nOn some of the programs there are putting your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly as as you partnered with them on this trip it was also cultural tour she wanted to learn more about tourism in Egypt for example it was again\nAgain sort of a broad based initiative but she and I was her undertaking\nThis awkward because her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid was that\n... ... it's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa\nNation that earlier this year he was accused of um perhaps saying some derogatory comments about what she wanted to do with say here is what this organization is doing and in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher\nHer wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does an Mrs Trump weighed in on that she said she wishes people would quit talking about her clothes\nI Wish people would fall on what I Do\nNot laugh but\nKeeping it it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's where I'm In the ...\nThe ... film at I think was uh something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a describe what she wasn't she wore a very sort of out of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on safari in Kenya\nAnd included for the safari portion a white pit helmet which for Africans\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily um something that they liked to recall a Nineteen century Clooney colonial exactly ruled by outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we try to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she ... she wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what does the news value in reporting on the first lady\nYou know people say well what do you do if you cover the first lady she doesn't do anything\nAnd that's sort of an interesting argument um she does she does it with a smaller staff with a smaller footprint I'm with and not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had for me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who\nIronically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian stinks they're everywhere in front of the things look at the things\nI'm Still in that way it is very interesting and I think that we\nVery interesting and I think that we we can't I Can't report what is she thinking but at the same time we need to get Fox at that we need to understand her and this trip I think very much hope that [noise]\nThinking keeping it she covers

Chang\nChang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today one topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do\nIt different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's\nHad a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jump to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there had fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nI Am director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out the opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief with a federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk from says the widespread stop\nAnd frisk getting a potential criminals reduces crime that conclusion contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forums justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in only really\nHadn't had any keep from them account now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting hot and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word of justice William loses stop and frisk he's a professor at the\nStop and frisk he's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt calls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing in Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed\nOut at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like a movie and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but\nOn Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real\nHighlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew is alive and those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir Putin's after a Russian lawyer you rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during it and today\nAt liftoff had proceeded and it was late for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd they have like five or my family didn't believe that [noise]\nThe crew American the Hague and Russian Alexei option are safe after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're return home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station and twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome thank you so we're talking with you also\nDo this we're going to the American ...\nCan you take the first time into these ... seconds for like ... ... what kind of training would they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience nip prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launch\nThey meant working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely factor\nWhen would be the next you know you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kinda mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know a kind of like gosh all that preparation that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and\nI don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows that\nAnd once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plants bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to come home than they are basically uh\nAnd they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for joining us today nice to talk of the I'll show you [noise]\nThat is NPR News\n\n[noise] one voter in a poor Kentucky ... says she is doing well under President Trump and she says those still in poverty should work their way out\nThere's some people that are just lazy just kills me just 'cause I Do work for everything I have her\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nTo strike you as puzzling though I mean the reports are being source to Turkish officials Turkish investigators saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting ... that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials said\nYes I think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference it's almost as if\nYou know there are taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this direction it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thanks

the Saudi military campaign in Yemen\nThat bombing campaign in our participation in a it was predicated on our belief that the Saudis are telling the truth but they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians [noise] given the fact that it is likely they are not telling the truth about what happened to Jamal ... why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside Yemen\nJordan the former ambassador to the private sector should also speak out and boycott an upcoming investment conference in Saudi Arabia\nAnd really there is a universal reaction at orange

NPR News the state department\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nScientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors\nIn the process that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight but as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that optical by growing human retinas unit\nGrowing a human retina requires a lot of patients it takes between seven months than a year you're Eldridge should know she's a graduate student in a lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive\nSo for the first week of their life I take care of them every day and then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on them every other day so there's a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light and color Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an elder written a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use these human reading all org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things so in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't sense read they don't have these red detecting cells and so we really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first and come sell to respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly right hormone was involved in the development of these colors ... so called comb so you had Eldridge do an experiment\nAdded thyroid harm onto the dish during their development and\nDuring their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition it's been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnston hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organized\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye\nThese studies show that the similarity is quite high\nEnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature control the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and\nDisease and how to develop better treatments the new

Ehrlich at the company my heritage wondered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful the technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA from more than one point two million people in this company's database and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person in that debate as a because that illuminate hundreds of feet than fifty so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these databases to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS you than you did a multiple cause I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like where a person probably lives and how old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify are supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you criminals all you can catch criminals with these technique but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either due to MIT\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find it really like you know ... and ... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the police\nThe I don't know in the political demonstration that leftover DNA behind a wheel cave with a foreign government are going to exploited the snake to defy us to do this for their own purposes so that there are many scenarios that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... which helps police solve crimes is way\nWe're working on these cases that haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're horrific murders of children things like that it just\n[noise] things that need to be ... and ... says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your tips and cut in for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero was fascinated in El Salvador in Nineteen eighty Romero was a dedicated champion of the poor and marginalized tomorrow the Catholic Church will make him things you can hear that story tomorrow by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWell much of the country was focused on me Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight last week first lady Melania Trump was in Africa she's just back her first big solo trip overseas\nShe went on a safari in Kenya she stopped by the pyramids in Egypt she also visited babies in hospital in Guyana and schoolchildren in Malawi CNN reporter Kate Bennett was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now Kate how\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady\nFirst lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for\nThe exactly this was her first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda [noise]\nWell I mean she said she was there to spread the message about the best which is her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with the u._s._a. ID\nOn some of the programs there are putting your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly as as you partnered with them on this trip it was also cultural tour she wanted to uh learn more about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa a\nNation that earlier this year he was accused of um perhaps ... derogatory comments about what she wanted to do is say here is what this organization is doing in in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher\nHer wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does a and Mrs Trump weighed in on that as she said she wishes people would quit talking about her close\nEye on what I Do\nNot blood I laugh but\nKeeping it it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's wearing them in the ...\nThe film and I think was uh something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a describe what she wasn't she wore a very sort of out of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on the safari in Kenya\nAnd included for the safari portion a white pets helmet which for Africans\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily um something that they like to recall a nine to country Clooney colonial exam ruled by outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we try to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she's tweeting as she wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou or if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what is the news value in ...\nAnd what is the news value in reporting on the first lady you know people say well what do you do if you're covered the first lady she doesn't do anything\nAnd that's sort of an interesting argument um she does she does it with a smaller staff with a smaller footprint I'm with not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had for me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who\nIronically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian stinks they're everywhere in front of the things that kept the things\nI'm Still in that way it is very interesting and I think that we we can't I Can't report what is she thinking but at the same time we need to get Fox at that we need to understand her and this trip I think very much help that\nThank you thank you I keep in it she covers the first lady for CNN [noise]\n\nThat does all things considered from NPR News\n...\nHe didn't turn up he didn't come back to his feelings say so we're all piecing it together but the fundamental question remains as we're as Jamal ... the Saudis don't have an aunt that to that [noise]\nI'm Michael Barbaro that's today on the daily from the New York times\nThe daily weekdays at six thirty pm on a PR [noise]\n\nWere twelve minutes away from marketplace on listener supported Alabama public radio service of the University of Alabama Hi I'm Pat Duggins I'm sitting in tonight for stand and gold he's on assignment in Montgomery four games is coming up\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors the Alabama Shakespeare festival in Montgomery, Alabama announcing its new festivals season under the artistic leadership of Rick ...
