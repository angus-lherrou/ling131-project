I'm Mary Louise Kelly [noise]\n\n... protesters some victims of sexual assault outside the U.S Capitol today inside the Senate\nMoved closer to a vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSince first thing this morning senators from both parties have been taking our long turns in a secure underground room in the capital visitor center inside that room one copy of the FBI's report on Kavanaugh's expanded background check\nThe report is confidential and has not been made public so all we know is what we heard from senators and people at the White House who have seen it or been briefed on it in\nThe wee hours of this morning the White House released a statement saying it had received the report from the FBI and that quote with this additional information the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court\nBy late morning Democrats responded\nThe most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nSenator Dianne Feinstein the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee appeared alongside minority leader Chuck Schumer\nWe had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized\nThis afternoon Republicans from the Judiciary Committee defended both the investigation and the process for reviewing the report Orrin Hatch that he was grateful to the FBI for a quote thorough very important investigation and Senator Hatch said this about capital\nWe've found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him and we need to confirm him right away\nMeanwhile Chuck Grassley chair of the Senate Judiciary committee is calling for a final confirmation vote within the next forty eight hours\nOf course at this point there are only a handful of votes that matter and for more on that we are joined by NPR's Kelsey Snell California there as you've been talking with senators today does this report seemed to have changed anyone's mind\nIt seems to be can hadn't comforting for a lot of Republicans a Senator Bob Corker announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh after a briefing this morning he talked with some of us later in the day as he was heading into actually read the report for himself and he said there was nothing new there to corroborate any allegations against cabinet and he said he felt he was comfortable now\nAnd then you have people like Lindsey Graham who was a huge Kavanaugh supporter before he says if anything this report made him

that in the early Nineteen eighties Brownsville New York was often referred to as\nThe beginning of the civilization burned out homes empty lot people were leaving the city and grow\nIn the eighties New York city had been hard hit by a recession than the crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of Dumont\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar those blocks were ...\nA lot but he did run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at thirty thousand dollars each they were called Nehemiah houses after the man in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem\nThe

nomination will stay aligned with the president and vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee that's on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News this\nMost of the individuals who did not a plan to vote are the ones that are saying to lay it again look let's be honest this is a political maneuver on their on their part\nThe advice look the story behind this as as the Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case they're strong feeling up here the Republicans are the Democrats Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission from day one\nYou're renting pilot ... and then they put out just on that and the moments we have left because differently when William ... absolutely they agreed that says about politics that says Republicans trying to get your guy confirmed before the midterm election\nOh I think there's a lot of truth to that we've said number one we would do it in a normal ordered a we were up to I Believe in Ninety One days now right and the average about sixty were about three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justice\nSenator rounds thanks so much you\nBet Mike Rounds of South Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program I Want to bring in another voice now one of the people from Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination\nShare thoughts on his nomination cataloging and went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight\nAnd that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath cataloging and joins me now Hi there how are you man I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what\nYou did with this information\nYou ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you did you\nUh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand the characters basis that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nThey let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered to this\nAll of this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation from your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I speak to what I Know about new three maybe four to five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think there's been a very thorough job in that sense at all\nThat's Chad Chad letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work or in looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign what a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nThe even

accusing a group of Russian military intelligence officers of more cyber mischief the indictment from the U.S Justice Department describes hacks against sports stars and against anti doping agencies in the U.S and in Canada\nIt also says Russians targeted a Dutch group that was studying the poison used to try and kill a former Russian spy\nAnd beer national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson was asked the Justice Department today she is most days and she is back here in the studio now with details you carry I'm Mary Louise okay so tell me more about the Russian intelligence officers being charged unwind now its timing\nYeah the defendants are set in current Russian military officers today's charges include conspiracy and money laundering a few of the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's this is very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all\nOf these seven Russian officers are in Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWhy bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did in sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes were of eating drug\nTest embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself now\nMary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help at the press conference here in DC\nFriends here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandon the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year\nSays ... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against the credit ... servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question may but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning that the OJ actually in a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be falter misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in\nThis case [noise] NPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of just a handful of

matters to keep you in touch with information that you need to make sense of the world can what can seem like a sense less time\nCannons to simulate those massive impacts here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor what\nDoes rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on a heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that are men grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nYou have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this was when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I demonstrated here actually\nIs real scientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal\nDebates are amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act\nIt left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event in its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fallback to actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration\nAnd our imagination and through the laws of

HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city government sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start selling at

the terms yesterday we heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm jumped over the last month perhaps because of ...\nLast month perhaps because of Kavanaugh do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battleground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized then the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far only one Democrat in front of that group is something we haven't heard from that Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nAnd yesterday Heidi Heitkamp said she was a no and this is what she said\nThe process has been bad but at the end of the day you have to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the

may said if you have an I'll get confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks so much ... well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed at nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants all Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin what may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone from the did than tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending your request for\nA form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact the former run this had been pre filled by the presumed reviews and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases would be allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called book I read by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question you\nI think it's relevant because first of all at once you learn in front of the so usually committee or what is ...\nAh what is taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black man phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one new\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like nudey three maybe four to eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News I'm\nGoing [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more of new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nMy favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people\nPeople are confident letting go of their place of work or in looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but they're also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nA it makes them better at their jobs\nAnd it also means that companies will be more likely\nSo it means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy that's Cardiff Garcia co host of our economic podcast the
