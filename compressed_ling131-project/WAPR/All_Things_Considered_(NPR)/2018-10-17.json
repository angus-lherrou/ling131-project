announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word that kind of look like ... in bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA\nIs planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their Mark Twain and it's all good\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of ... main such a lock on not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis\nThey still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word\nNell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\nI felt Sean I still feel Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than honorable discharges have been denied VA benefits\nPotts factories were closed down on the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging appetite for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines there's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly\nThere are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you introduce border checks the place where there are no border checks for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape out the board has not without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well\nSo the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would it be in the case which is a pretty big hit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor taste and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k. the breakfast\nTrick shock waltz it's true that's the other European countries with suffering as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite to the Y. yes I think the ... will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented or by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think that she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always pleasure\nPeas Mm Mm [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know it's like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with over so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of late and that's the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between river and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nBut the wrong kind of apology could decrease Cooper's revenues I went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nIt it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... he didn't do better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest sticks and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your matters and flowers and\nOh I hate flowers and candy because otherwise I think on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] when people thought always wanted to ask you this question how they do I'm curious I think the main way to change that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always it's awfully skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere morsel because people are always was like oh you're just you're not be with your paper\n[noise] no apologies for telling you that

throughout Canada which raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border\nIn the midst of all and in the United states so yeah that's awful\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to link Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use ... welcome to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that\nWhole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used\nMarijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state\nBut they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada actually\nMeant and immigration laws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state

the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road\nHigh winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite a few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the ... or not a bunch of high rise out a lot of construction\nConstruction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is multi generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a really down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we thought it would damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nAnd if you had that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back and it's going to force a much higher when ... ... or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and as a

defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion and diversity and they'd love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think ... when it comes to ...\nTo see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one such as the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but often times the factory that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what students for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents burned missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use of personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although there is going higher on everything else similar to what is happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in the case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial there was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that\nIdea so I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at married in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and it sounds like\nIn the context as economic status or something that speaks more to someone who's opportunities are resources is very important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of that sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race it's a start discriminating on the basis of race\nWell ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks

million dollars but prefers the money is spent on projects like water and electricity Saudi Arabia is providing a hundred million dollars but it's uncertain whether it can be used for the

billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly ...\nGo Boyce reports when and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall ... [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that chronically ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nTwain and it's all good going from the perspective on main such a lock on not\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis\nThey still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR\nIt's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word now Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News\n\nI felt shot I still feel Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than honorable discharges have been denied VA benefits\nWhether ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type or the board is not without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than it otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit ... sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe in the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such the scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so they would be an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries with suffering as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all quiet at the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government\nDoes it deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy block in London and I think how she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political

what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know it's like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with over so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of late night so the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent but the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we tested apologies and evolves or the commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... so he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we

it really makes me nervous you know she's democratic [noise] but she also doesn't necessarily represent all the voices that party\nI think it's interesting that she kind of gets offended when people show up at her office asking her what is your stance on abortion and what do you think about that because she's like on for the people people know that have always known that but it's just quite obvious that we don't know that or would it be asking\n\n\nHave you ever been to one of my town halls before okay McCaskill has been near perfect voting record when it comes to the issue of abortion and her more than Thirty years in public office\nTown halls before okay McCaskill has a near perfect voting record when it comes to the issue of abortion in more than Thirty years in public office in the state she learns that the biggest thing she can do to keep her seat in save abortion\nIs to stay quiet about it to hit on this is from Jim von barren and that's why when asked her about abortion she quickly focuses on birth control\nIs there's something we all agree on we all agree we want to prevent abortion and guess what it's not rocket science you know what it is it's birth control [noise]\nWhen asked whether she would ban abortion to see this is the Down syndrome she says personally\nThat would never be an option I Would consider um I think Down syndrome children are joys I think they are God's Gift in many ways in terms of a bright ray of sunshine\nThat's why when she talks about abortion she reframe that as a matter of government intrusion\nBut I also believe that some decisions the government is not very good at in fact the government tries to do a lot more than it should right now\nAnd that's why when Senator McCaskill and now she would vote no on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court none of her reasons had anything to do with women or abortion I oppose Kavanaugh because of\nHis belief that there should be unlimited contributions to campaign and instead you talked about campaign finance and big corporate money I'm that's why I voted no and that's the move a Democrat and a red state just word around these moments like
