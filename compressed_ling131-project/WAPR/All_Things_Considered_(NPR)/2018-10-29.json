White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this

calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his

you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any boats\nOr the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the

of squirrel hill which is where the attack took place in Oakland\nAnd officials say the organized vigil to help the community mourn and one of the people that was killed in Saturday's attack was Joyce Feinberg she worked down the street at the University of Pittsburgh for a long time and your husband taught here at the end you for a long time\nPresident Trump is planning to visit tomorrow with the first lady hum what if people you've been talking to said about that what do they want to hear from him\nWell one person I spoke with his mirror Patel she's a senior at Carnegie Mellon she heard about the president's plans and she's in two minds about it\nI mean he is our leader so we do have to respect that but also sometimes you\nFeel that is the really coming here for the right for\nThat is similar to what my colleagues and I've been hearing from a number of people in the past few days that President Trump is our president and that he is the griever and chief but also that rhetoric has been so divisive that they're not quite sure what they would hear and what they would hope to hear [noise]\nTake a step back I Know you've been covering the story pretty much nonstop for the last two days how does the city feel to you right now where are people in Pittsburgh it in the grieving process\nI think that's just be gone and they said he feels like it's been more gentle to itself\nI Would say we're a small city in squirrel hill and the Jewish community form a central part of it\nSo people that we've talked to feel horrified and hearts sick and there's a shared sense of violation that

Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat follows an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants oceanography who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nTom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so they're already something like two thousand\nHard in the border NPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise said something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh this goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of firsts still uh they'll do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car there are barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers will also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well ... that's with officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or they're only in a support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy is and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past in again into support\nOf duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who are doing everything to get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or fears staff and uh again general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said of border security is national security [noise]\nAll right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up

to\nDo something about the problem that affects the state and his area I'm\nAnd I'm so small you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but ... also worries that the people of party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at fault\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close race for me my focus my campaign's focus is making sure they know who I Am I message but also getting them out to to

York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as a country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here\nVery first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he said something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have it is what she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views of Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens\nOf course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity

AM he went on to gab\nAnd posted a final message and he wrote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in books\nAnd then we know that about five minutes later a nine one one call came in was reporting an active shooting in the synagogue he carried for guns with him according to police and as he entered he shouted that he wanted all Jews to die and began shooting\nWhat do we know about this man\nWe know that Robert Bowers is forty six years old\nHe lives about half an hour south of the synagogue in a kind of rundown apartment\nAnd according to our colleagues at the times who have talked to his neighbors and gone to his apartment his neighbors said they don't really know much about him they don't remember him talking to anyone they don't remember him having much of a social life at all he doesn't have a lot of footprints\nOther than on line and most of what we know about him at this point\nWe know because he had this account on gap\nTime now for our defending the first series where we expose the enemies of the first amendment free expression and free thought\nIf you remember a few years ago there started to be this narrative about censorship by Silicon Valley tech companies\nThat made it Research Center released a devastating report today documenting the censorship of conservative speech by silicon valley's tolerant tech giants\nAnd especially sort of Twitter and Facebook being\nDocumenting the censorship of conservative speech by silicon valley's tolerant tech giants\nAnd especially sort of Twitter and Facebook being accused of bias against conservatives\nAnd gab sort of came out of that controversy was started by a conservative programmer in Silicon valley who was sort of set up with what he saw as excessive political correctness so he started this website\nAnd as a result of the fact that it had very few rules that were no rules against hate speech they weren't doing a ton of\nOf censorship is pretty much anything goes a lot of the more prominent people who joined where people who had been kicked off of other platforms lever being too extreme and\nAll of these people flocked there because gab would allow them to say pretty much whatever they wanted there are other people on gab to obviously they have something like seven hundred thousand members\nBut the most visible stuff on the site was always the kind of shocking racist anti Semitic far right content that was being shoved off of more popular platforms\nAnd what about ... hours what have you been able to learn from his postings on down well\nHe joined the site in January and we've been able to recover some of his post they've been taken down but we have an archive of some of them\nAnd going through them it's sort of gives you the impression that he was obsessed with anti Semitism I mean substantially all of the posts that he posted and re posted were about Jews were about conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world\nHe was critical of President Trump because he thought that President Trump was too accommodating of ...\nSo this was powers Kevin really making use of gab as it was designed to be used as a far more lenient platform than Twitter then Facebook well\nBefore this shooting we had another act of domestic terrorism which was this male bombing bomb sent through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations like CNN and the suspect in that case this guy from Florida Caesar say Iraq\nHe also use social media to post sort of extreme and divisive content\nBut he didn't in a different way he was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big ...\nAlso use social media to post sort of extreme and divisive content\nBut he didn't in a different way he was using Facebook and Twitter which are kind of the big mainstream platforms\nAnd he was using them to get into fights and attack people and engage people who he disagreed with and that was sort of the appeal of that service to him was that everyone was there and you can find his enemies and communicate directly with them\nWhereas Robert Bowers seems to have flocked to gab for the opposite reason because that was where the people who agreed with him or and that was where he could find a community of people who shared his views who he could communicate openly with without sort of the watchful eye of the platform getting in the way\nKevin you and I have talked about the fact that social media sites like Facebook and Twitter need to be stronger about policing this sort of speech that we're talking about\nBut I Wonder if your concern that what we're seeing here with gab\nMight be a consequence of that any crackdown at all has pushed people with more extreme views\nOn to a smaller and less public and more fringe e social media sites where inevitably there's less oversight and also more people who hold equally extreme or more extreme perspective and is that a problematic outcome\nWell I think one thing that we do know for sure is that when people get kicked off of Twitter and Facebook and other large social media platforms they don't just stop posting they don't go away they find some place else that will tolerate them more turn a blind eye and\nI think we have to get comfortable with the reality that one of the trade offs of having ... our biggest and most influential social platforms be healthier and less toxic is that a lot of the worst stuff\nIs going to get pushed into the smaller more private enclaves\nAnd there might not be any way to avoid that even if it shuts down even if something else takes its place\nKevin what have you been thinking as you've been reporting on all this over the weekend because it feels like for many months we've been talking about the divisions on social media\nMostly in terms of politics what they meant in twenty sixteen what they might mean for the midterms but it feels like the events of the past week had sort of exploded that idea that the state\nWhat they might mean for the midterms but it feels like the events of the past week had sort of exploded that idea that\nThe stakes are actually far higher we're talking not about how this divisiveness might affect people's votes but about how it's getting into people's psyche is and is doing unbelievable we'll we'll damage\nYeah I think for the last several months I've been covering social media with a focus on what affect all of this behavior happening on social media would have on one set of elections\nAnd what I'm realizing is that it's far far bigger than that because what we're really seeing is the kind of breakdown of the dividing line between\nOnline bad behavior and real world violence ...\nFor a while lots of people thought that because threats or abusive language were happening on the Internet that it was somehow less real name was less threatening to receive a death threats on Twitter than it would be to receive it over the phone or ... percent right\nAnd I think now we know that that's just not true that often this stuff is one in the same that the threats and the conflict and the polarization that erupt on line and in the media\nCan bleed over into real world violence and are doing it pretty frequently and in in ways that are horrifying the consequences of all of this of this stirring up of anger and hatred and polarization I think are going to be with us for a long time\n[noise]\n\n[noise] bearable terrible thing what's going on\nIn our country frankly it all over the world [noise]\nSomething has to be done something has to be done\nPresident Trump denounced the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh even as the death ruled by questions about what signals he has sent intentionally or not to extremist across the country\nHave you ever asked him to please not use that type of language when referring to other people for the case of civil discourse\nDream is across the country\nHave you ever asked him to please not news that type of language when referring to other people for the case of civil discourse in this\nCountry everyone has their own style and frankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences\nBut those around the president including vice president Mike Pence rejected any linkage between Trump's language and the act of isolated extreme in\nBut I just don't think you can connect with the threats are acts of violence on I don't think the American people can American people believe that those who are responsible or the people that actually conduct these threads\n\nWe'll be right back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Selma", "day": "29"}
