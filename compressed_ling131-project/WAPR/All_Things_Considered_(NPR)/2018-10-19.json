leaked by Turkish investigators and more information continues to emerge painting a fuller picture of what may have happened to him in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and yet and usually turkey\nIt means to emerge peaking a fuller picture of what may have happened to him in Saudi conflict in Istanbul and yet I'm usually turkey is carrying out its probe in full cooperation with the Saudis NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what the sensational alleged murder means for turkey the Saudis and the U.S\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attractive they left the consulate after ... entered on October second one traveled to a coastal district on the sea of Marmara while another headed into a forest in the northeastern part of the city Turkish media say parts of the forests have been searched\nAs have the consulate the consul general's residence and diplomatic vehicles citing audio and video recordings the leak suggest ... he was tortured killed and cut to pieces\nPossibly by a Fifteen minute Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ...\nPresident Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence adding quote if it exists but Turkey's foreign minister of Joe ... says neither secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is just in turkey nor any other American official has been given any recordings he's heard through an interpreter was as\nGood as the guy that we did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumble prosecutor's office\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team\nUs base turkey analyst Soner chopped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president aired on can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but ah someone pretty significant and important uh thrown under the bus\nPotential candidates for blame have emerged in the media suggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed bin ... from responsibility\nPersian Gulf analyst Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore that could show was engaged to a Turkish woman and that whatever happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi consulate\nIt doesn't have diplomatic speak to us in order to to ... and ... a visiting citizens\n... says the question of what turkey wants is likely to be\nThey do in order to torture and called up a visiting citizens\nBut Henderson says the question of what turkey once is likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between ... in Washington the U. S. is counted on the houses out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nAnderson says that move could now be coming at an awkward\nMoment November fool foods when sanctions on Iran or increased again and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market but at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance on perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before we've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate are you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course\nThe places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's\nI mean it's a great question of course\nWith you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to\nThe um the consul general the Saudi consul general's house\nGetting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis\nAre there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting\nOr the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but\nAs it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this\nThe human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the ...\n... when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of think forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression thanks very much thank you [noise]\nThis is NPR News\n\nNew as Saudi ties we take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of your mouth crucial Jeanie Buss credited Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\n'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district at the knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican I was born and raised in Jordan parents are from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go outside with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but they're\nThe reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump Administration\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis thing was going to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you go to vote you get ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nBuild it\nAnd they will

Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect shift a little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me the only people hugged them when we actually put the minutes we constantly did emails that I've met more people are having Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them in prison in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nHospital in Ireland near schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the

community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from book\nHe was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing than being a champion from books or

the caravan with his two young kids\nIs I don't see them up for what it all but one of those [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then this chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside

Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and across this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what their requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we're not going to lead the spreads we're going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to disclose to everyone a show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around and we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams I

I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm Out here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still I asked you see if the republic\nWashington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... election Doug new see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treated us in\nOur film IQ if you've got to vote you go to vote you go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look here's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... Buss credited Trump pitch the campaign trail and us merchant narration\nAnd we'll just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis this was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet yes some eyebrows had been raised to when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from ... thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David ... he is the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion an expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world\nK. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe for un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authority\nThese competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal details\nOf uh of ... killing and those same really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a\nOf a fistfight ... seems really um counter to what to what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nUh is to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation looked like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve analyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two\nOr it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion ...\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide or they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it in many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject\nTo ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our ...\nUm what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international law as it would be something that\nFrom you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about you know but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used the word from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin now there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you what gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Tut's mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse\nTo honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOf the things that always amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that see I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite\nActually put them in we suddenly get emails that I've met more people haven't Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people in the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news or people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little libraries\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up this sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then all you know when I'm Out jogging ... seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of his idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the
