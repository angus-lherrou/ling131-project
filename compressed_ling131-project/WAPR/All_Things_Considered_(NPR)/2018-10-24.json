to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nAnd the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being and band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get\nAt first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for men does\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nAnd she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and\nAlso that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to all\nThe all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nOr how a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her on the crowded wall\nSupporting and keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down in like help them be positive and just the point that they what they're going through so they don't feel like giving\nLilley has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope helped strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be tests\nMy uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this was going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like schools husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super\nPowerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalyst to change Morris says you start

radio news Alabama has a long and complicated history with the ten commandments when the Old Testament to the Bible this election day voters will decide if that relationship continues as it is I take a look at a ballot item known as amendment one on the upcoming election\nWhen you're ready to go\nOut on the leash\nWhen after Charlton Heston delivered the ten commandments in the Nineteen fifties success will be the mill movie classic his Moses didn't seem interested in politics\nYou know freedom without the law was you know\nTwo thousand years later here in Alabama things are different I've been working on this off and on for about fourteen years\nThat state senator Gerald dial he's the author of Senate bill one eighty one that eventually became amendment one on the upcoming ballad this will allow the display the ten commandments in constitutional manner on public property is just the latest legislative attempt to do so dial says the political climate it's better this time around\nWhat about a dynamic shifting the makeup of the legislature both the house and Senate majority of the Republicans in the house in the Senate so we just felt like a we're very fortunate\nI

was cleaning out his office in the state house after thirty five years in the Alabama Senate dial says some good will from his colleagues many of help overcome some concerns about legislating religion\nI kind of leaned on and say hey I won't be back let's do this I I may have gotten a few steps devote to make this a priority not that the bill is not a priority but ... that hey we need to pass centered out since last time and he'd like to do this and he's been two sisters on this\nThis constitutional amendment could cause some problems that's the view of Randall Marshall he's the executive director of the American civil liberties union of Alabama marshals ... some people may not fully understand the amendment\nI think the effect of this amendment is actually going to be to invite litigation against school districts that post the ten commandments Standing Alone thinking that somehow they're allowed to do so now\nMarshall ads this amendment doesn't do anything new\nThere is a provision in there though that says a provided there posted in a constitutional manner Therrien lies the rub because the amendment doesn't provide anything that's not already lawful if he had paid school can\nPost the ten commandments in a constitutional matter there's nothing to prevent it from doing so now\nHowever senator dial disagrees\n'cause it's in our constitution they're following the laws of the state of Alabama and if you've got problems with that\nAmount of being in a gay all and you've got to sue the state of Alabama to change our constitution felt relieved that legal responsibility from those people who might want to do but the ten commandments name\nAnd Marshall says that is not the case\nThat's clearly wrong or as a from a legal standpoint and I am a lawyer um he's just flat wrong on that ah there would be no obligation to sue the state and in fact you don't have a cause of action against the state you have a cause of action against the school district that's operating in an unconstitutional matter\nAnd these fights can get expensive costing hundreds of thousands of into the millions of dollars in legal fees senator dial says there's a provision that prohibits the use of public funds to defend the constitutionality of this amendment\nWe've had outside sources not on from in state after state who stepped out and volunteer to say if we were we will have their attorneys and we will pay their cost it will take it through the process\nMarshall has doubts about that too\nWhat the senator is missing here is that no outside organization is going to come in and say NATO\nDoubts about that too what what the senator is missing he has that no outside organization is going to come in and say not only will we defend you but we will pay the other side's attorney fees if we lose there was no organization out there that will do that and and and so that's why\nA school district would still be on the hook\nFor potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars\nSomeone who spent a lot of time on the losing into fights over the ten commandments in Alabama is former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore\nWell on display them in the Supreme Court in two thousand one I Believe it was and uh by two thousand three there'd been a a complaint filed with the federal district court which are ordered the ten commandments removed\nIn Alabama ethics panel kicked really more out as chief justice in two thousand three for refusing to remove the ten commandments monument from the lobby of the state judicial building\nIt was a legal fight and most people think it was just a religious fight a it was about the knowledge of God it wasn't about to display the ten commandments that was made clear by the federal district court\nThat said the question was Kansas State acknowledge God and he said no\nAnd I submit to you state does acknowledge God in many ways in law\nMoore says the state's relationship with the ten commandments is still complicated\nOr

Brennan was sent to CNN's New York office right on not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however a package of didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her\nThey say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late in the clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that uh it's possible that there

the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our\nThis is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there is only life inside in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think\nOf mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable too\nFellow students could be in trouble but these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt orchard Mesa middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to a wall\nOr all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nHow a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her on the crowded wall\nDeporting keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just the point that the what they're going through so they don't feel like it\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nIdeas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work
