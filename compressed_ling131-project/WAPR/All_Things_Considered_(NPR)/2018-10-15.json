Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote strong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back\nSix to ten generations this is an attempt to quite a controversy it'd be a controversy that has dogged at war in four years and it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShould she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos ... day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis one also released a campaign style video that had clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her at claims of Native American ancestry and since then yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she called ... their DNA researcher and puts him on the line\nYou did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nNow president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts of what we have a Native American ancestry or in your bedroom\nSo ... you know you can hear that she's also like\nYou know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least who one of members have been told an audience of every or is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nMillion dollars\nFor trouble if you take the test so that shows your\nYou know [noise]\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up ... million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by

had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the shoes are in a run for president herself and twenty twenty\nI think that's a really realistic odds at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November\nIs really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they have been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty races going to kick off pretty much it's in his mid term\nVery briefly has recorded all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All

ride around Philadelphia\nThese are places where Republicans are playing defense in areas that\nYou sort of think of as you're Romney Republican district and where the president is not popular but neither are the Democrats are and they're not liberal areas so what Republicans are trying to do in these areas is that you're out there half a dozen seats around Los Angeles that they're defending can they saved three or four\nMhm and what's significant Alex about these geographical clusters what's happening there that puts them so at risk for Republicans the seats\nThat are really the knife edge seeds that we're talking about the ones that will determine whether Democrats gained twenty two seats are twenty four seats in the majority you're mostly talking about districts full of affluent college educated white professionals\nAnd why are these the voters who may be decisive in these midterms rather than Latino voters or African American voters\nI don't want to say that any group of voters did not have the potential to be decisive but if you look at twenty sixteen and you look at today the group that has moved the most\nIs white women and especially white women with college degrees and if you're looking at the suburbs of Chicago or the suburbs of Philadelphia those are the people who voted Republican in the past maybe voted for Trump in twenty sixteen and have voted for Democrats pretty strongly since then\nFor Democrats pretty strongly send them\nOut how are Republicans trying to protect these thirty seats\nThey're trying to do a couple of things at once and sometimes it's sort of an internally contradictory strategy the main thing they're trying to do is just disqualify Democrats that they're trying to go into these suburban communities\nTalk to white women talk to white men as well and say if you don't like the president you know fine but here's some things to be scared about about the Democrats\nResist he's demanding open for the ones who are living from law enforcement agencies that enforces immigration laws America's doors to more wind and\nThese are voters in these districts who might like a Democrat like a Joe Biden or even a Brock Obama ... but they're not going to care for Bernie Sanders right they're not going to care for abolishing ice or certain kinds of rhetoric around national security or policing the use our\nRitzy white suburbs right and a lot of the stereotypes that people think of tend to apply in these places\nYou've heard and O'Neill Delgado is extreme and offensive wraps now got old Mitch he'd bring the same

personal negative campaigns I've ever seen in a midterm election\nMexican millennials Democrat named mark ... doesn't get support from the San Diego\nThe other side of it is that you see Republicans trying to put issues out there that get their own base excited so even in suburban district there are many voters who are enthusiastic about President Trump in twenty sixteen\nAnd many of them are less energize right now than the Democrats\nSo what Republicans are trying to do at the same time as they talk to moderates and say you can't trust the Democrats are the party of polo see they're the party of antifa at a party of abolish ice they're also trying to talk to their own voters and remind them of the things that the president has done that they like\nConservative read me getting the job done [noise] I'm toy aisle and thanks very city to stop illegal from taking our jobs fight alongside Trump implement his agenda and use conservative threats to fill the dawn wall\nThere's not really a great precedent for getting voters to show up just to say you know good job I appreciate it so what you see Republicans doing in this case and Democrats did a little bit of this eight years ago is try\nIs trying to hammer home to the president's core supporters what threat the opposition party is to him personally it's not just about policy is if you allow the opposition party they tried to impeach me the best the gate me they will end me as a really functioning government leader\nSo the strategy has not please thank me it's knows that if the house there's lots of Democrats it will destroy it saved me [noise] so this sounds to me Alex harder for the Republicans than for the Democrats\nIs there a realistic version of this way the Democrats don't take back the house despite meeting just a third of the seats that you identify as somehow play sure it's\nDefinitely harder for Republicans right now than it is for Democrats but you can see a scenario where Republicans hold the house and that probably involves conservative voters getting much more mobilized over the next month and Republicans can reach some of these suburban voters and sort of played with them to remember the in their hearts they're Republicans all along\nDo you expect Brett Kavanaugh to factor into the house races in a meaningful way and what would that look like in these suburban districts\nI'm going to give you a little bit of a we usually answer and that I think he will matter and I think it's hard to say how you probably will have conservative voters who are more tuned in now than they were a month ago because they got engaged and angry about the Supreme Court fight you probably also are going to have\nThose martyr white women who have been talking about it's not going to do them any favors with the Republican Party to have watched that fight unfold so I think the outcome in the house is ambiguous is much much clearer in the Senate and the story there is almost exactly the opposite of what we're seeing in the house [noise]\nWe'll be right back [noise]\nThe daily it's supported by sleeping ... featuring that new sleep number three sixty smart bad they're
