began deliberating yesterday remind us what options they were considering\nWhat do you think that that could actually charged with first degree murder by injuring structure the what's called it could also considered second degree murder and that's what they say here's a different basically they have to find that he was guilty of first degree murder but there was a factor that charge and that that\nHe believed the shooting was necessary but that will leave with justify\nThe jurors also have the option of finding who killed the fix ... counts of aggravated\nBattery that one how for each shot Jason Van Dyke fired [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] a little difficult to make out there but that's some tape from the court room with the ...\nWith the jurors reading out the verdict fair I Know that during the trial many were surprised at the defense put Jason Van Dyke on the stand how did his testimony compared to what was shown repeatedly on on a video of the shooting\nWell keep testified that he saw the climate Donald raised a knife up to his shoulder and that video ... see that happening\nHe also testified that at some point look phonic Donald after he was on the ground tried to push himself up you also cannot feet back on the video when push on this point chicken and I said that he had a different perspective than with a video camera was\nSo that you represent what he saw that prosecutors had him on a pretty heart basically saying your testimony isn't matching reality\nAs we said there were significant protests after the dashcam video was initially released how is the city been preparing for this verdict and how do you expect the community to react to it\nWell today there were a lot of preparation police were told they'd have to work long hours they had police and parking lots nearby ready to avoid if you eat at um there was a lot of people down town were allowed to go home from work early expecting that that may be protests

their balance\nAlso are Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria and the story of a veteran trying to find a speech when I decided I was going to show that sewing machine and I was like I'm gonna do it right now and I literally just shake my head into dishes Saturday from NPR News\nThe numbers are there hey I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial testament temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens is assigned\nThe into the room and he should have been here for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she ... she said questions there that are being right these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell [laughter] that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what Thomas on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think that response to what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice rally foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up at once\nCommittee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had her Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after our break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate I think it's a huge deal and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern are hearing from and players they can't find more hurry that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... get implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers economist Dean Baker says low\nLow wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent of last year so some of the minimum wage law but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they will start to slam on the brakes as the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News

she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit ... on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we sent that out into the world we\nDidn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we're we're reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's going to happen to an investigation what's when it's published and you know one of our ...\nYou know one of our editors I'm Matt pretty like to say as we were working on it he said ... it's not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all that simmered down

you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway ah these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of\nAnita Hill the other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say

position and the links for speech has already just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speech as a kind of closing argument did was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else um she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is and she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed in that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tight\nPretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she

verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell acted this I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think are those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course\nI'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described with chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes blank um he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this incident so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well\nI think that's hard to say that 'cause I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there is another trial of laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a preventive at night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA a problem with the community feels but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who encountered the chronic Donald

Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria and the story of a veteran trying to find a speech when I decided I was going to show\n\nTo that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation and his family that he would have acted like a ton of time I had\nBy the way he acted like an atomic ...\nI think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice for all I forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice that welders are reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about\nHad some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people question her integrity and I certainly won't\nEither but Tibet specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate is up but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what Thanksgiving should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\n... and very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\n[laughter] you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn

S. unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate I think it's a huge and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century\nCentury has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players if they can't find work earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... get implications for wage\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor twenty three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating so who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates that said you know look I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began\nIt began raising rates gradually and has continued that patient to the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nYou so many people on the fed and many other economists they would have started to swim on the bridge the other one would go to ... percent and they never would have allowed to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe United states and Canada have finally made a little piece in the trade war but some farmers in comeback while they still feel like they're under attack\nIt because of that we have been buying more local dairy from small producers to just send a show our support for the local area and a straight hair\nOn trial results very wars next marketplace [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSupport from Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nFocus women's conference featuring over twenty five speakers workshops in panel discussions to encourage educate and empower women October nineteenth to Dallas Eighteen in Mobile Alabama\nSchedule and tickets at focus women's conference dot com mobile botanical garden presentation and signing of Andrea wolves the invention of nature Alexander von Humboldt new world on October ...\nDiscover how humble created the way we understand nature today more at mobiles botanical gardens dot org\nThe forty seven annual ... festival of the arts October twenty eight and twenty first from nine AM to five PM featuring visual artists from across the U.S live artist demonstrations music and spoken word performances food trucks and children's activities more at ... dot org", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "05"}
