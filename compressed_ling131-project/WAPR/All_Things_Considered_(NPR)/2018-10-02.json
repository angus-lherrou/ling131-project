F. A. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now I just hiring but first of all what are these chemicals or pee fast it's an entire ...\nPete fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them have been around for decades these chemicals are good at Republican oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\nPee fast is also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers in the million how harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say pee fast\nIs are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\nPizza chemicals have been linked to a wide range of how the facts including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease elevated cholesterol\nOn the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast and the U.S but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals\nIt's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like ...

of the year the Trump Administration\nAdministration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding differently today is\nAn issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage pretty fast chemicals\nAnd we don't know what the plan is going to look like until it's out sometime in the next few months\nSo what could people do to protect themselves today\nWell the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon

good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company

could be other than good news is the\nAuthor is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decided to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal\nFederal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for Congress but\nSenator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinces the rest of the

Morrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nThat's NPR's Julie McCarthy she's traveling in Indonesia central souk ... province thank you very much Julie thank you\nNow to the Supreme Court where today the justices grappled with a difficult death penalty question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection\nTwice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing them and so incompetent would be unconscious\nWe'd be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who become psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive\nThat he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet [noise]\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murdered after the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain a punishment with the trial judge believe was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina

all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I melted Chang when Brett Kavanaugh sat down before the Senate Judiciary committee to respond to charges that he had sexually assaulted

welcome thank you\nSo I Want to get a sense from U. of how rare it is to hear a Supreme Court nominee talk the way Kavanaugh did in that moment I mean have you ever heard\nSuch partisan language like that during a confirmation hearing\nNo I haven't and not even during the confirmation of Clarence Thomas was nothing like that\nSo let's say Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court do you think that he can be seen as an impartial arbiter in cases with political undertones\nIt depends upon who's doing the fear I think the losers will not see his decision as impartial\nHe is now branded as favoring variety over the left so in political cases the left will look stripped to lose and do attribute that laws not to a disinterested treatment for lower but to a political agenda\nI mean there was this I deal that a lot of people have about the Supreme Court that these justices that this court is above politics or should be above politics but let me ask you how far removed is that ideal from reality\nVery far removed first of all over the justice has been appointed by president of a particular party who\nIf he's doing his homework will be sure to a point to justice who will likely you agree with the political position of that party so while we have decisions that use the language of law\nI have a law we know that the court's decisions the justices decisions are influenced by their political allegiance\nSo I guess what I'm really asking is how productive is it having a conversation about impartiality when impartiality is a bit of a fantasy\nThe Tuscaloosa symphony

Nineteen eighty three with only a hundred guys and I think there's a sense of pride that comes with having one of their own be nominated to the Supreme Court I have heard this from people who say look I'm a Democrat but I still take pride in judge Kavanaugh being nominated surpasses politics\nAnd Robin where did you start your reporting after Dr Balt before makes her allegations knowing your connections to you\nSo soon after Dr Blass before it's allegations surfaced we started getting tips about the name Deborah Ramirez that she also had a story to tell and\nAs a result I started mining my Yale history and sources and to begin to ask questions around the incident as well as more atmospheric information about what those two were like in college freshman year and afterwards\nAnd as you're talking to a former your classmates\nYour classmates what are they saying about who Brett Kavanaugh was in college what kind of person he was what his behaviors were\nWho they're describing is a person who was very much of kind of a party guy known for partying heart in fact the people I talked to said I partied right along with him on they didn't necessarily say they were angels in comparison there was heavy drinking he was part of it so were they\n... and just how hard drinking and partying was ... according to people you talk to\nYou know a number of people said to me was the one at the keg he was a guy standing by the keg\nDoing what drinking a lot and actually what was interesting to me was that you know one source said to me that Brett want it to be the guy who got the

was this kind of an interesting picture of sort of all want to be\nMad about campus who actually really was known for holding up the walls that was a phrase that I heard a few times and what does that

I caught a nominee Brett Kavanaugh outbreaks in silence for the first time\nFor me I found that right after Brett Kavanaugh appeared on Fox with his wife and portrayed himself as something of a choir

where people were sort of proactively calling me and saying wait a minute that's not the bread I knew one of them went so far as to say you know you can't lie or way onto the Supreme Court\nUm and what did they think was the lie you know basically that Brett was whitewashing his past\nWhat ever a time that you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened the night\nFor no cause I

he crossed so then came to hear\nYour for the ... just before the movie will be the truth the whole truth and nothing bus or fruit so I Hope you got a Jew\nAnd for me and my personal reporting process the hearing was a really galvanizing moment as I'm dealing with these Georgetown Prep alumni who knew Kavanaugh at the time\nSo many of whom had been reluctant to speak before all of a sudden I'm getting inbound calls saying this is not an accurate portrayal we wanted to stay out of this but this is just over the top ... during the hearing he was asked about red knot and what was meant by those were not alumni references and he said\nShe was great friend of ours bunch of us went to dance with her she hung out with us as a group\nShe's a dear friend that we really respect I'm really
