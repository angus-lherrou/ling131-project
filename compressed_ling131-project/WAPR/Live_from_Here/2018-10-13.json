snow and stand like a road signs warning about the winter up ahead but down in Denver the weather was bright and Chris and the only worries people had was whether there was enough pumpkin spice to go around\nDenver's a happy town these days I always enjoy walking in Denver but now there's a palpable joy around every corner whether you partake or not it's hard not to smile at all the people buying legal marijuana and riding around on scooters\nThis city seems to have attracted like minded people from all around the country who agreed that life was better when they were ten\nI found a great coffee shop that struck the right balance of serving great coffee and chocolate scones without any added hint of ... arrogance I sat near the window and flip through outside magazine looking beautiful

just want to have someone that have fun with someone who enjoys life the way it's meant to be enjoyed and who doesn't pass out at the site of a croissant\nThe good thing about being my age is that I Know who they are the minute I see them like that guy she pointed to a gentleman who looked like an angry months old Jack o lantern he's too much work that guy if you haven't learned how to handle what life gives you that the face you get\nAnother guy walked by the window where the tweed jacket and a little cap and mustache now he's got potential no guy wears tweet and pretends to be an

I saw a grandmother chasing her grandson around ... young skater kids dress like winter surfers\nAnd men and well worn cowboy hats and despite what they tell us on the news we weren't at each other's throats we were enjoying each other's company and smiling with candy corns in our T\nWe grab some cider and doughnuts Kelly took out or flask import a little something extra into her cubs she said this helps fight the cold and if anyone who gets fresh with us it will help us fight them too\nWe walked around the grounds and looked at the courthouse dolls scare crows with crooked smile and pies\nI Love pi if there's a pie around you can guarantee someone's trying to have a good time\nPie show up at parties Thanksgiving and warm diners on cold winter nights you never see a pie it a crime scene [noise] have you ever went looking for the bathroom at a fall festival got turned around and saw strangers running the other way and realize you were lost and corn may\nI don't understand why people like these corn mazes being lost isn't fun being lost a stressful being lost all you have to pay is even more stressful\nBeing lost when you have to pay what pumpkins or catapulted over your head it's a little stressed I've had all year\nHave you ever stood in the corn may squishy could do that in your hand next to a three year old boy named Kevin while you both cried for your mommy [noise]\nI have\nKevin's mom and dad eventually found us they were very nice even bought me another Jonah\nI never found Kelly again but I really liked meeting her but I'm hoping she found a friend
