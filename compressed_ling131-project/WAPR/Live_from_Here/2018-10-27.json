It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine home\nThe streets were colorful is always and Halloween has hit the city

long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and a permanent snarl\nDavid lived in the village with Rocco
