about a pilgrimage in India to cook for a goddess and we'll hear about an iconic writer who mused on both feasting and fast and let's get to desert first\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] do they do\nWhen I was in ... school Fifteen Years ago I knew a woman named Stella she was a pastry chef in the making and we really didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me\nDrew kindness\nGraduated not long after and we fell out of touch with\nEight years later we found each other on the Internet you become an extra chef but even more she'd be done writing\nQuirky terrific blog\nAnd eventually got more and more into writing about the science and history of desserts getting inspired by how classic cookies and take some pies and putting were made in the past\nAnd then re imagined those recipes for the president [noise]\nAnd just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cook\nWe'll see her first cookbook rave part debut on the New York times so [noise]\nA ... thanks so much for joining us\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's like comic American desserts so what makes a desert iconic American\nI really wanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized very quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and so that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that so I didn't want to be a collection of\nRegional desserts desserts that are important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that\nConnect us together coast to coast ... so how did you decide which ... qualified\nMaybe it's kind of like that um classic a quota about porn you'll you'll know when you see it but you kind of have this instinct right like I mean from the yellow cake Betty Crocker and Duncan Heinz have ensure that yellow cake is something that all Americans had a chance to try and love and\nPolitically great to have you here thinking or having a valley so I'm dying\nTo hear the story about this pilgrimage in India but first I Want you to tell me a little bit about Caroline and that that area of India\nYes a ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd tell me about this pilgrimage ... what are these women doing [noise]\nIt's a pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying and a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the homeless vets got us and her temple and it's called ... and the the trains are filled\nWith women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride and and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that is filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around or adding to the temple or adding to the city and everyone's setting up and what they're setting up our makeshift hearth of three ...\nThree bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're you know how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the way\nThat they refer to her is actually called my mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this at this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as Patrick Holly and um she worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and the as millions of women are setting up makeshift harvests with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nOn the morning that this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um\nThey dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around helping to light heart's still all at once at the same exact moment all around the city there speakers that women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so was actually really incredible about this is the smell you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut park\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same\nSky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise] [noise] yeah\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us so it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a clip hot over an open fire 'em they add water\nThey wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rights get soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nAnd they add all of the seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol\nUm many women as ginger there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and uh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf\nAnd they wait for priests to come around this can take hours and sort of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap\nAnd then when the priest comes they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots and then they're free to eat it\nAnd this moment is so beautiful because it's the thing that I've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take a spoonful they taste each other's pong dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana leave back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise]

counterintuitive about making the claim that an author most people have never heard of as one of the most important food writers at the last half century or there were many incarnations of patients gray\nShe was born in ... in the south of England grew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics at a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage owned by her mother\nOr through to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and took up a career as a translator editor and writer eventually publishing her first cookbook plot to Jordan Nineteen fifty seven and then in fact went on to be this the first woman's editor of the observer which was\nQuite possibly the most important newspaper in London at that time and you all of this preceded her or Mediterranean odyssey which is really what she is she's known for everyone who knows\nPatients gray nose or throw money from a weed so they think of a this woman who live this very intrepid\nA rugged life in Greece and Italy and then finally in ... the very south of of Italy and this is a unquestionably one of the most fascinating chapters of her life but it it's by no means the whole person\nBut patients and from a wheat occupy as sort of unusual place in the world food writing\nPlace in the world food writing the book is considered to be one of the best books on food ever written and yet\nPatience remains almost completely unknown or patients was a contemporary of Elizabeth David ... another British food writer and M. F. K. Fisher who have far greater notoriety or than patients does and patience wrote about\nA food and uh ideas in food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways it's surprising that she hasn't better known you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from a weed or changed their life and and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nAppearances first cookbook ... it was published in the Nineteen fifties it was extremely influential in England uh what was like and how to set the table for her future work ... was a remarkable book\nAnd as you say it was a a run away a best seller published in Nineteen fifty seven\nAnd one of the first mass market paperbacks of its kind penguin\nThey're much better any kind of desert that's really has a custard and it's much better if you give it at least one day in the fridge\nLove those recipes mhm Bridget thanks so much for explaining this one\nMy pleasure Sally thank you [noise]\nBridget Lancaster do decorative editor for new media television and radio at America's Test kitchen find their recipe for the Boston Tea by a slim [noise]\nTell me oh I get to take your calls and leader more for your sweet tooth the greatest sesame candy on earth\nOver I'm Frances lamb and this is the splendid table from a PM American public media\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nAlabama humidity's foundation and preserving democracy informed citizen who's the October twenty third ten twenty five AM or high school Roseville and five thirty PM coastal Alabama community college Thomasville more at Alabama humanities dot org\nDance and things and iron Dale serving Alabama since Nineteen Seventy nine with complete selection to dance where and point Jews including professional fitting walk in and dance out\nThe Alabama Center for childhood cancer in blood disorders located at children's of Alabama more on line at children's A.

[noise]\nAnd we have none of them ... cute like when\nI Fernando how're you very well may I call you Francis please do thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant one it permeates our entire house as we have speakers and all the rooms and we've we've listened to you so much and so so often that a year like my brother you've been you've been here at home\nWith us in Ecuador [laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come back with her one day 'cause it's a credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live in a very hot place or do we get a real like our nor Easterners or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it is very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much because salt leads preservation but just to keep it dry\nAnd a ... and so we really are are very careful with a you know how we store things\nAnd one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend had just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... it's just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk [noise]\nAnd so in the midst of the party at my wife says what shall we\nShould we do what we should knowledge split in the freezer for now ... put it in the freezer and it's been there and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we get frost it because we cannot possibly\nThree pounds of prosciutto before which oil and I am totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing it would be speaking to my ... pulled it out for sure is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen previewed on IFC um this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant frozen block it proceeded before that's a\nThat's made me in a can of ... in some ways a a blessing problem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if you have questions to\nYeah if you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that didn't work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're then they're\nIn a home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that in a week some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be acquaintance um for more you know sort of to some as it was before and maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally be frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself if you know a deli nearby Menon consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo you ... slicing thin\nYou know package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but so I'm thinking about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably wants it was to process it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your\nIn in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of secret so you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a song the cure ham if you're if you're not in position to be able to enjoy it and it sort of like silky thin sliced a state\n[noise] no I assumed that the thin slice of phase of its life is over it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder David we even thought maybe it was just putting the whole thing and the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole time and she would happen\nYou know I have never done that but I is that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey\nTry it and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture of all the flavor on a beautiful cure if labor is going to be there so if you do that and the slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be quite salty so of course you you want to think about that when eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing but you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed it than you took the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\nYou know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it you know as a flavor an answer for you know vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew\nAnd one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake it a big square into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pot looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it's kinda like that idea of like different things I sure\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah or if you cut it set up nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat and maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fat to the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scramble some eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I don't you know I Would like to use the ... to do with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whenever you do with it thanks so much
