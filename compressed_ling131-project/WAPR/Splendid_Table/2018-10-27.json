tasty on the tapes but that idea of hasty is informed by years of eating incredible food all over the world\nWhich makes for a perfect person for our series the key three what we talked a good cooks

know the ability to detect the three ... of human in a recipe or that the tomato sauce is a subtle ... of ginger skin and sure yeah sensitivity like that is all good but what I think having a good palate is really about\nIs just being able to talk about what your taste it\nAnd you can put into words what you're tasting and I remember our producers would always say to us look you're tasting the food for the viewers so you have to tell us what it's like\nAnd I think you'd do taste differently if you're thinking about how to describe it you look for a story to tell what's the first thing that grabs your attention the thing about how the flavor changes if it mellowed out or if I keep seeing intense and then you start to think about other ways to describe a flavor maybe you think about it like music you\nTalk about its rhythm more depth throughout high notes and the more you do it\nThe more you come up with different metaphors and comparisons and ways of describing flavors and textures and the more you start to appreciate\nWhat it is you're tasting\nBecause now you've really spent the time and effort to really take notice of it so you know I'm not a restaurant critic but I play one

splash about ... vinegar is what elevates a dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career around chefs versus a cook himself and then it's a photographer and a writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegar as\nHe's traveled the world for them he infuses them and yes he makes them in his apartment or contributor shot a fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home\nMichael thanks so much for talking with us I don't think travelling so you have to tell us how your obsession with it\nSecret weapon home\nHi Michael thanks so much for talking with us I don't think for having me see how to tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came to that\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kind of snowball into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the best malt vinegar I've ever had in my life\nSo definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar it could be so much more of our soil and the kitchen and we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier it's not just this overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make a big red either two two one two or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma in the vinegar by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process to use it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines or it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that it's actually about the balance harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example the vinegar that are unique to certain places and how they're used\nGoing to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar and have some kind of a city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving in Italy I just got back from a trip in Amelia remind your region where ... is king and ... another thing is probably the most ...\nAnd moving Italy I just got back from a trip and mail you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original boss amok vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people haven't even experienced it so seeing that vinegar and contacts and seeing that it's\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little aged parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegar from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd make these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... and an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced you know ... or ms counter American rice vinegars the things you buy an supermarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and race vinegar can be the same way\nThere isn't just acidity there there is flavor uh depending on what kind of race they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional Raisman or coma zoo is probably the standard the gold standard of rights ministers in Japan but then there's aka sue this red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black you know the wooden boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of a QC province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... or ... in vinegar but what some of the elements maybe it's more scientific elements that give vinegar distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid in solution and that solution is water so kind of like wind there are all these volatile s jerseys\nSix percent a CD acid in solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wind there are all these volatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is\nOften the sensation before it's a flavor so you think that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you elevate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it it is a carrier but\nAnd there are a lot of these circular there's now out on the market you guys have done a test of the best ones right\nThat's right our teeth thing and testing team has dove into all of us regulators that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook\nAnd they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circular leader and it's small and it's sleek and it is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful about how much is the jewel so the jewel is around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation of CB devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower now they're very light very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for two hundred way which he pronounces her time starts circulating doing like so much for that\nAnd thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at

friend got me one single little ... the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the phrase or a ... a ... they make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken legs look right there\nMake something with them but the problem is I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken like look right there I\nMade some bake a cake oh God that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know if I guess\nAre so you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal cast iron brains are about what size it\nUm I Would say probably working ... pretty large\nA big you know like a a big oh yeah oh cool\nAnd then you have some cats aren't cookouts which was like the basically the little mini brings it was right and how big are those as a semi shape so and again\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more in the end result later so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for like a breakfast or ... ... exactly what you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake they're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen ... razor another they were talking 'cause that is a really fun to be the requirement to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think it's a beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brazen when you say is\nA cast iron so it holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that\nIt can actually hold he really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brain short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see your the skin or you want it\nSay you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you are raised chicken and you want to see your the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it 'cause you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut you know just really get that searing nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that be ended up ... says he ate what kind of stealing or breathing are no longer not smart smart unlike something\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark fear them what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you say in this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a write in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave me this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us like\nSurfing will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to

their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say I'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini\nTo learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more than say um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do\nIs cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still zucchini and zucchini he cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface little hands cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle is quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest as divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe or medics what if you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that
