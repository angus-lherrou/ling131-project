talking to people who are inspired by her with her people who live with her [noise]\nWe're talking about the life of chef and writer and nobody is out and there's a terrific book called end the Lewis at the table with an American which\nIt's a collection of stories and essays by all kinds of people knew her were were inspired by her or studied her and truthfully it was kind of the inspiration for our approach for the show we using different voices in each showing a sliver of what she meant to the world\nSarah Franklin as a writer and educator was the person behind that but\nHe's our thanks so much for coming in today it's a pleasure Frances\nSo I Am really interested in how you got interested\nIn the work of a new Lewis I think we're both in the same boat and that we never knew her personally we never met her I was right but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine and it has an eat when the editors publish entire issue to voted to the American south and they felt that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written minus ... what's called the what a southern and in this essay and if\nSo that's positioned the culture of the American south in the culture the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside music\nMusic and literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was just incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who was interested in food and and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and fell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with a notice as editor Judith Jones who's the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on ... road and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously but I'm leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is their English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd then interviewing Judith Jones about work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with missile Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that sort of snap to attention and pay attention moments in in Judith Jones as career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights the Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans south and then through the perspective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat\nUm and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication what do you mean by receive it in the winter we food that came late\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a cook and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community in a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons\nSort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized that sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history and the American south and of of really giving dignity to that portray as its own entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture\nMhm so I I wrote a story about a loose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up in and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I didn't think before mhm\nIncluding where I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being a political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as or just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds of people who ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community should grow up to them where in slave mhm if they were freed slaves at once that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us mhm if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine you started as a wrong that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective eye to so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures\nWas one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life with a rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it and and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms in the forest I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was you know this was ...\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves yeah ... they're literally making souffle is in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear\n... to it too I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you started the hogs and the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nThere's just really incredible image of and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later like can you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally mhm and but also remember reading it and the way she describes\nThe hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit is it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man and a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you know this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all ... [noise]\nUm the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly um I don't know if you wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unfair lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible Frank messing what she presented deal with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time and and that she was gonna say it's sort of quietly and many people who knew her ... her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be set and she said nothing at all but if he was an open her mouth or put pen to paper\nIt was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise\nAnd she wasn't going to dart away from ... fruits and and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that you know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find both yeah paradox and that and I think they're in like turbulence\nYeah incredible incredible life\nThank you so much been my pleasure Francis\nSarah Franklin the editor of Edna Lewis at the table with an American average [noise]\nShe teaches writing at NYU and she's also working on a book and Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nMm [noise]\nUm\n[noise] one of the Lewis is deepest friendships was with another ... Scott pecan they bonded over a commitment to southern food they write a cookbook together after the last years of her life\nSo after talking to lots of people about miss loses beach in the world we also wanted to know what it was like to be standing next to her in the kitchen\nSo high scot free to talk with you a great to talk with you Frances services so fun to get to speak with you because we've been talking about ms Lewis all these different angles and all these different directions but\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors mobile botanical gardens presentation and signing of Andrea wolves the invention of nature Alexander von Humboldt new world on October nine\nDiscover how humbled created the way we understand nature today more admiral the botanical gardens dot org\nAlabama coasting marketing event management and digital solution and publisher of the Alabama coasting magazine a resource for what's happening on the Gulf Coast more information at Alabama ... dot com\nDon tell somebody orchestras sixty fourth season featuring the music of Harry Potter in Star Wars Tchaikovsky five the best of the eagles and Mozart's Jupiter more information about the two thousand Eighteen Nineteen season at H.
