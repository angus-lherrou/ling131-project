being the instrumental equivalent of the soprano would be intruding here like a delicate lady at a club smoker\nSo out came to flute and now let's hear how masculine it sounds without him\nYou see a lot of us assume when we hear the symphony today that it must have spilled out of Beethoven in one steady gush clear and right from the beginning\nBeethoven lifted pages and pages of discarded material in his own writing enough to fill a whole book\nThe men rejected rewrote scratched out tore up and sometimes alter the passage as many as twenty times Beethoven's manuscript looks like a bloody record of a tremendous inner battle\nBefore he began to write this wild looking score Beethoven had for three years been feeling notebooks with sketches some that he ultimately discarded is not right\nI have been trying to figure out what his first movement would've sounded like if he had left some of the men I have been experimenting with the music speculating on where these sketches might have been intended for use and putting them back into those places to see what the peace might have been how to use them\nAnd I've come up with some curious and interesting results\nWe already know almost too well the opening bars of the symphony\nNow once Beethoven had made the strong initial statement but then how does he go on to develop it\nIt does it like this\nBut here is a discarded sketch which is also a direct and immediate development of the theme\n\nNot very good and knocked very bad taken over by itself but it is a good logical development of the opening figure out what with the music sounds like it's Beethoven to use\nBeethoven to use the sketches the immediate development of his theme\nWe can find out by simply putting the sketch back into the symphony and it will sound like this\nIt does make a difference doesn't it not only because it sounds wrong to our ears which are used to the version we know\nBut also because of the nature of the music itself\nIt is so symmetrical that it seemed static\nIt doesn't seem to want to go anywhere\nAnd that is fake all at the outset of a symphonic journey\nIt doesn't seem to have the mystery about it the right person has that whispering promise of things to come\n[noise]\nThe sketch music on the other hand get stuck in its own repetition\nAdjust\nDoesn't build and Beethoven was first and foremost a builder\nLet us look at another rejected sketch here is one that sounds like this again Newt is based as all of them are on that same opening figure\n\nNow my guess is that he would have used it somewhere in this passage\nKnowledge of the same passage with the discarded sketch included\nThis gets Justin Trudeau itself into the living flow of the music and stands there repeating grounded until such time as the music can again take off in its flight\nNo wonder Beethoven rejected\nFor he of all people had a sense of drive through his music that his second to none\nThis sketch just doesn't drive\nAgain like the first one\nThe first one static and stuck\nNow vis sketches different it has real excitement and build\nI suspect it was intended for a spot a little later on in the movement here\nThis is certainly one of the most climactic and thrilling moments in the movement you just the beginning of the code of the last big push before the ... and\nLet's see how it would have sounded using the sketch I just played you\nNot at all that it has logic and the bills but what Beethoven finally did use has so much more logic and builds with so much more ferocity and shock\nThat there is no comparison\nThe other although Goode seems pale beside you\nKnow here's a sketch that I really like\nBecause it sounds like the essential Beethoven style\n\nWhich has pain unit and mystery and the sense of a rupture and\n\nIt would it fitted very neatly into the coda\nHarmonic ... rhythmically and every other way except emotionally here's the spot in the ... I mean [noise]\nKnow let us at the sketch to it\nWe had to come down from a high point to a low point in order to build up again dramatically to us\nUp again dramatically too was still higher point\nThis is in itself good and acceptable dramatic structure\nIt happens all the time in plays and novels as well as in music\nBut this is no moment forwarded Beethoven is already reached his high point he was already in the last lap and he wants to smash forward on that high level right to the end and he does with astonishing Britain's\nIt is this genius for going forward always forward that in every case guides his hand in the struggle with his material like even the very ending was written three different ways on this or Castro score\nHere is the first ending he wrote\nAn abrupt typically ... an ending\nWhy did he rejected it seems perfectly All right and satisfying but no he apparently felt that it was too abrupt\nAnd so we went right on and wrote a second ending that was more extended more like a ... more noble romantic majestic went like this\nBuddy on the manuscript this ending is also buried beneath the crossing out\nNow he felt it was too long to pretentious perhaps to majestic it didn't seem to fit into the scheme of the whole movement where the main quality is beer economical direct statement of the greatest possible for us\nAnd so he tried still a third ending and this one worked\nBut the other thing is that as it turned out the third inning is even more abrupt than the first so you see he had to struggle and agonized before he realized so apparently simple the thing that's the trouble with his first ending was not that it was too short but that was not short enough\nPlus he arrived at the third ending which is as right as rain this is how we here today\nSo Beethoven came to the end of his symphonic journey for one movement that is imagine a whole lifetime of the struggle movement after movement symphony\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSymphony number five in C minor by Beethoven to New York philharmonic is conducted by your functioning [noise]\n\nIn the time we have remaining we now turn to a selection from the philharmonic archivist\nMore information on all of the latest from her Monica releases is available and in my field dot org slash I to this is the overture to the magic flute Alan Gilbert conducts but New York philharmonic\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "New York Philharmonic", "city": "Selma", "day": "02"}
