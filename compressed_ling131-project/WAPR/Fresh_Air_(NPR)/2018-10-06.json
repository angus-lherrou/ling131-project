Washington that name Brett Kavanaugh is likely to be in our lives for decades he will change the balance of the Supreme Court replacing the courts swing vote Anthony Kennedy\nAnd he may have an impact on control of Congress and how much President Trump is able to accomplish for the remainder of his presidency this hour how did we get\nHow did we get here what does Kavanaugh's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court and what are the ramifications for the country a country that is in the midst of the me too movement and a month away from the mid term elections let's start with the defining moment on the Senate floor when America found out that Brett Kavanaugh was all but guaranteed to sit on the court\nMr President I Will follow chicken for jazz cap and\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that came after a contentious three months that began on July night\nHe's a brilliant jurist with a clear ineffective writing style universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time\nPresident Trump had promised to nominate judges who oppose abortion rights Kavanaugh's name came from a list given to the president by the federalist society an advocacy group with the conservative agenda the cabinet told senators that he viewed the landmark roe versus Wade decision settled law\nAs a judge it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey been reaffirmed many times Casey is precedent on precedent which itself is an important factor to remember\nAnd I understand the significance of the issue the jurors credential issue and I understand the significance as best I can I always try and I do hear of the real world effects of that decision as I tried to do of all the decisions of my core of the Supreme Court\nHe also promised to be fair and impartial judge being a good judge means paying attention to the words that are written the words of the constitution the words of the statutes that are passed by Congress not doing what I Want to do\nIn early September Democrats used there two days of questioning Kavanaugh to point out that they weren't given enough information about his record\nFirst round of hearings Kavanaugh's confirmation looked like a sure thing\nUntil a week later when the Washington Post published a story about allegations from Christine Blasey Ford who claimed cabinet had sexually assaulted her when both were in high school she agreed to testify about it before the Senate Judiciary committee in one of the most watched congressional hearings in decades\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're back now with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy hops in in Washington so what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court\nWe heard from retired Justice John Paul Stevens this week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Kavanaugh should not be on the court\nIs ... ... and he should have been in for when he was another one [noise] but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change but I Would\n... an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as they are\nNot just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and unlike liberal activists\nThat all those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said called his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's a very highly unlikely\nPossibility given Kavanaugh's demeanor and\nHow does that happen also that of justice refuses himself or herself\nIt usually happens when there's a set of rules you know let's say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interest if your family is involved in any remote way if you're some very close friend has some financial in something like that there's a whole set of candance of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied\nUm the justice has tried very hard not to have those conflicts\nTo have those conflicts you can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to battle out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said\nWell Tom Goldstein President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there a before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nCould he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well of Clinton's might\nBe a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of things involving liberals and conservatives and yes there's I think zero percent chance that he's going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the front issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage in the like\nI Can't see him doing that I think that what he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and ask for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he is some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave a this air of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all you know what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion well\nI think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade but we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are\nAre popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against well\nI don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court kind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just\nWith is just playing the joints where you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right well who knows what that means you can feel into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation\nBut there is a right to same sex marriage it's a binary light switch on light switch off thing I Can't see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to\nIs all kinds of things that go with it like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them develop photographs of your same sex wedding\nI mean ... most states have laws that require\nEqual treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass\nA federal statute requiring equal treatment of um same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would ... that would be true everywhere\nRight one thing when you're likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections to doing things for example involving abortion or same sex marriage in light\nThe county clerk who doesn't want to provide the marriage certificate that sort of thing the court right maybe there but the things that actually also helped same sex couples really feel like they're equal maybe more in question what\nAbout the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation the Robert Mueller investigation is going on ... will will cabinet being on the court make any difference there\nWell we we know that he has said things that are at least ... the police questioned the correctness of than famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required the ... President Nixon to turnover tape recordings that incriminate him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nIt's true he's also said that it's one of if he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary but he also said things that may be set has said maybe it was wrongly decided that we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of eggs\nIt of executive power in a wide array of areas and even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nDo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time and the executive branch you spend it in the White House and he was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries unlike me get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives in ... as he become the swing vote on the\nCourt on Robert in it in a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote\nBut mostly Obama and the other conservatives and in the court or at least pretty much in lock step on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented in gerrymandering he'd just send it in a whole bunch of other you know ... ... in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court\nHe could move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject I'm which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court and now there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hardcore\nConservatives with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but\nUh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think that that ... that phrase too fast is probably where it's going to be you're going to see the chiefs influenced the most not that he's going to switch sides that he's going to turn into a liberal all of a sudden\nUm\nNo\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat Thursday hearing uh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nA who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie a statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ten point advantage on that over the summer now does that remain this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is\nDemocrats democratic women democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategist on each side here this is John ... Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found at least in the last week is there certainly seems to be some Republicans coming home um the\nProblem we had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats [noise]\nBut at least on a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week a lot of them felt number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford\nThey just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting to it so it's sort of by the Republican Party a bit and um\nI I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's I'm going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that way Trump kind of doubled down and attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think his cabinet eyes ... I just think all hands are fairly leaving from his cabinet that are perhaps even more\nKelsey I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today a talking with protesters\nThe Republican leaning a in suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed to President Trump or all along and there was a huge list of a potential targets in those are in those swing suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's read repress reprise those um there are\nA twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are in overwhelmingly red states so out of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states it's a it's\nIt requires a huge uphill climb well it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators\nGuest Lindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter] so so ... for a Democrat um we're in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted ah because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say\nPresident Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women have been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "06"}
