special ... or something and you don't like who I Am now who are you knack they May Day here and this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of terrorists interviews with the chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how your stance personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nJust one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became this coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost his skin and bonds and he was jittery and and then it's\nComing in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost his skin and bombs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nYou look toward a higher power to give you strains and there's a saying that goes let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how you you you were are still are in an atheist and raised in it without religion um did\nEither I too I too felt guilty you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was like I Would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of the basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time is is that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think except about and once you accept that I think you're in the door [noise]\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in Tulsa programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nFor the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important too\nThey are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nBut the truth but the but the other thing that I think is really important to that we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get health again sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that that I mean you know that's what he says that that that those three months were essential\nTo did that program that you not rely on a higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to lead myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I live my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody mhm that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find that you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define it in in a way that works for me which is\nUm it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get\nThrough ... what does family mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nKnow it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of ...\nIt's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was a it was a ... it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again\nA and it was way be it way just to stay sane intersect focused on something that\nYou know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's I'm not part of what saved you from your math addiction was such a degree of self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think once they we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with the diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's yeah it's so subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know and they can help you I think that's awesome absolutely\nA Nick tells a story in his book but to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in this we hadn't seen that for a long time in in ... you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on the family vacations and that came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them and to Karen and to me and\nWe had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed by asking you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh I'm that's what's going on here upsetting my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here and be a child or going to be you know with my family and so I'm sort of ... and ... and then all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back in the rest of the triplets\nAnd so I'm sort of so and he's all of a sudden he said he felt he said that I I feel better now and then he went back in the rest of the trip is was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of decided whether ended up and you're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\nWell listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... can you know ... ... good luck with some you know with continuing unity and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much\nThank you Terry thanks Terry\n... about his struggle with addiction is titled tweak growing

ever done and he did call you know just a few days later and said he was ready to go into treatment but he absolutely could have died\nIn that story you\nBasically had two options and I can think of

you're lucky that he didn't die as a result and then he chose to go to rehab a few days later\nIn retrospect do you think you'd have ... you should have chosen the other option is which is would have been I'll take it home and maybe you wouldn't have gone to me\nI think that every situation is different in retrospect it was fine in retrospect you know it worked but if I was there again I Would have gone to get him and brought him home\nAnd [noise] done everything I could to get him into treatment because every day he was out there it was so dangerous I mean that night I didn't sleep of

Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy but some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage you know he was\nYou ever do that I never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he would be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but whatever it takes\nWhatever it takes to get someone to treatment about what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to get off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening\nUm and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know Dr either a treatment center check you in and so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that relapsed you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of like it and I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us and soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the hills and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt either the ...\nFor him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress ... one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work\nA Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program\nIs probably going to you know a a ton of step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as research for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nToo I think most people know what the positive\nA part time but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but\nNot most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I I was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people told me\nOver and over and over again go to Ellen on new things go Ellen on meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt\nYou know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me also going into these\nWhat I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as in I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the day's\nLesson on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as press makes gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's it's not I mean there is really you know I think he's great country what could I say he's he's an unbelievable person I've been on his dad and so I'm I'm I'm prejudice but he\nHit extraordinary who's just this lovely person he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know with kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know
