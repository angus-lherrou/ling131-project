by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen well many bands of the time were singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of

pleasure reader so let's start with that song\nFresh air and congratulations on your new biography of lead\nOn thank you so much it's a pleasure to be here so let's start with that song which sums up so much about\nWhat may may Lou Reed different from other means heck are being made it at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only leads career but into the larger music of that time\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nYou know they were mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time well yeah\nThat's true and that there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was on a like flu it in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise] yes I did want to go ahead I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know they're really\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that but when he left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you never want to spend money we were living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took a loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and you know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that\nHe couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand would ever lose needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending transgression of is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nDon't have any I always see what's he goes you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were there the ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they had that kind of relationship that was a\nYou know along with\nA you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them\n[noise] uh you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names it was never like mom and dad um and you know he certainly would characterize them in song\nYou know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of yeah the kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for an lead\nThat's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know just going to make some movies now and you know it says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know and you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger to you know to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports has a patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kick Nico the band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time were who was in the newspapers all the time they're not you know not art critic friday\nIt was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time were always in the newspapers all the time you're not\nYou know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like a crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and you went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspapers or whatever he did got attention and uh you know Lou took advantage of that\nBut that also hurt the velvet underground in a\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and the world seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bat and you know for for people who have entered them yet you don't hurt our amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go you know just needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nCalling from Miami in ... hitchhiked away and crawl on USA flubbed ... rounds on the way to shave their legs and then he was a ... says he they\nTake a walk in the wild and said hey honey ... ah\n[noise]\nCandy came from now on the island\nActually read walk on the Y. outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually\nThat's ... read walk on the wild signing his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head friendly lead but if I could tell from your book like he was a cat he wanted to hit so badly finally has one and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you don't look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band and have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know what a mortgage company that is that yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethic kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once he had destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album and a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that woods unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I wanted he wanted to have is music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of ...\nPopular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so\nI'm In his album St hassle you you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise]\nUm well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart called slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart from lots of\nLots of the arising about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is who became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there will be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh\nBut still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... saw the ... not the slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing um\nDifferent ... of St hassle but not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great raining [noise] um so there there's the middle part [laughter]\nA a street hospital joined us anything about this this part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was the idea died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nOf a blue turns that male character which were female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guts to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it this is Lou Reed [noise]\n\nYou know in Libya weaving in and it really was nice talking and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak\nBut you know it could be has will try and explain surgically talks about how was your old many guys since it is and it's not like we couldn't help but
