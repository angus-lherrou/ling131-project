Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition in New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place\nHe told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPlace for first dirty book I ever read I Love grace mentality of whereas it I've never read the book the Wii of Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter] I Know that dirty\nBut uh in Nineteen fifty six that was pretty dirty\nAnd oh it's a great you ought to repay plays a sequel to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for\nA [laughter] but grey metallic you know how does that famous author shot of her on the lumberjack Ivan the dirty ponytail fitness a typewriter and I was obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book\nBut Peyton place itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut whenever they got to a sexual scene they would cut short cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake or if somebody was getting turned on made show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shops and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but

healthy did you go the other direction to take a willing might as well plan up to the hilt and envy you know take on oppose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took on\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising and no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies that didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside of group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always\nBy doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked the Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy's how she pronounces it [noise] um so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines where there were many off at the time\nA fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean of pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on life\nAnd on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is score to classical music where there's one note that if the gun shot and then divine crawls over the trunk of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive lady that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later\nIt began to look like the ... film the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in our world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign\nSo to me it was too big for one wall and it has to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to like Jackie Kennedy devine was you know a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot hip or are they all want it to be best Meyerson and\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't hep ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see in the wake stock and they're all really funny and they have a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest\nIn Philadelphia I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous a drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that you work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so what he said that that was the ... thing I've ever said I didn't mean to be ... I Believe that\n... most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and every\nDay on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous America [laughter] I guess you really needed to be famous [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in show business to complain about\nAny of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\nYou know in your book there's a lot of skills of movies and I'm not to stills from movies that were\nTransplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter] you also have to rush failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... and how to duty not not no no this is the most but okay next\nArab bell yes he was psychotic look at it was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the

puppets\nAnd I did Cinderella and then later punch and Judy but at the end I Would come out from behind the stage which is like breaking a third world puppetry and say to the kids you know stick out your hand of dragging puppet will bite it for good luck\nThree fourths of the kids she earned and they loved him and go crazy the other ... the rest of them have nervous breakdowns and started sobbing

Howard Cooper thank you [laughter] and he's a he's a designer yeah she's a designer who who is not known to me um\nShe's pretty famous should come to ... ... one of the first Japanese fashioned liberal for deconstructed fashion um she's been around quite some time hugely successful in Japan\nOkay you you you described your luck as disaster at the dry cleaners [laughter]\nYeah I like her clothes she always has something the matter with it something out of it so I I Love the idea when you spend more money than your shirt on an outfit for fashion no one thinks she spent money they think you got it for a nickel somewhere in the thrift shop but actually sent it on purpose it's like getting dressed in reverse\nIts sneaky fashion it's wearing outfits that you liked that regular people just think it's something the matter with it and you got a bad code on\nI mean I'm I see people on the street that are homeless than actually looked like outfits that I've played a lot of money for it [laughter] and um I find that ... I I find it to life and my father used to that you bought that something that they saw you come and boy but they did see me come [laughter]\nI was eager to get it okay this is far too personal yum [laughter] so I'll Try it anyway [noise] um do you like costuming when it comes to actual that\nNo you mean to someone have to be in a certain outfit no I'm not that specific thank God but what somebody has on I always really think that if boys turn their belt halfway to the right one for the ... is in on the side Marlon Brando did that ... it's a lot of confidence I like\nI like somebody that pulls often effort less look but no I I don't have to have somebody dressed as an airline pilot for a guy and I know that I started laughing\nI was the only way I was there something that's inherently absurd it's ...\nSex life it's funny accept your own uh-huh [laughter] really it every person says and years and never in what way as\nWell because the lengths that people go to the extremes and the conditions and the mental exercises and guilt and shame and happiness that everybody goes from what they'll do for sex is is is never ending in mind boggling and very interesting to me\nAnd um and I don't think a lot of times people choose any of it I I\nI'm a friend of mine I ... I think I have it in this book we're um her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's community and I asked them to ...\nThe people forget if they're gay or straight to the workers had never once they don't know who their family is in a ... but no one suddenly doesn't remember for gay or straight doesn't that prove really but you're born that\nRight okay so I Want to quote something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you and what a sobering welcome smack in the face that statement was yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet accredited funeral\nIsn't everybody in show business on the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field that we're strange which have to tell them they're good for the rest of her life\nI figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great thing to shrink from it I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk about other things and making the most uncomfortable what's I'm paying for this let's get my money's worth so I just after that going to think of the things that made me the most up to like to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking to her you know Freud said the best thing ever a redline that's I think so brilliant is turning hysterical misery to comment on happiness what a great great long\nBut I find it such a paradox and what you spelled out sever that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and and a career and yet he tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life as a campaign for popularity isn't that a paradox [noise]\nNo I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic\nEverything that I'm running out of your own or not ... enough but only a neurotic\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and in show business certainly it is a it is or politics all the same thing you have to get people to like you\nI'm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that and a crowd of funeral is a nice thing I like that but the older you get the last chance that has happening not another reason to make younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like the Oscars when somebody goes to ... to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want family [laughter]\nYou know because as as you've said you've made a living selling shock uh will surprise surprise yeah and and some of your ... some of your early fails I paint them you have some very like vile we you know repulsive thinking people in the ... [laughter]\nI don't agree but okay okay\nAgree but OK okay there were there were\nCertainly using anarchy to get their point across and they were rebelling against I'm very particular worlds retirement lusting after things that are um maybe you shouldn't ... I think the morals and all my film for were quite obvious from a good guy one in every one of them are we've\nNever lost I think people are really surprised\nBy how it just kind of like nice and funny and easy to talk to you are like earlier in your career before ... before the ... there was as public of John Waters as there is no I think people thought that you would be this really peculiar person who might I'm\nReally traffic and sales and\nAnd the old days they ... they found the marijuana and my car for a quick way you know I don't want to have a\nYeah I think in the beginning but I think through reading books may be more and more my public speaking and stuff is it they realize that I'm not the characters I think no director is usually not that many Stephen King go out there in ...
