the publication of a book of his poems and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the plane so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from Archie thousands next interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk good for one more or less\nThan we both ran out of

to march with you or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's drink too when it's over unless strength to one way to meet\nYou know like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become nostalgia acts during the ... because\nThey're just don't jacks because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog and their regurgitate ing things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and

works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this bones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to\nUm to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] um\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes there was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion um\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and\nThere's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is this is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth and ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so\nI've always wanted to I Want to get on their record as saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah on many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men\nOr the ... of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to fight not being ... can tankers are in transit you know it's just\nIt's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his from the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called\nCalled titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes in their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly accorded me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I

name in whose name do you come to Idaho with me in these low 'cause she already is and twins laying realms of aimless privacy\nI think that home and um get so little about where you were talking about the connection of your father riding in solitude and demeanor re reading alone and as you are in his [laughter] yeah and during his solitude yeah as\nYou noted also kind of a a humor you know [laughter] and I remember I Love one of his lens where he says uh feel so good not to love you like it did it's like they tore away my blindfolded and said we're going to let this prison to live

someone Marion here that's nowhere to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear them all you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I I was a five year old daughter on the side of strangers watching them being performed\nWatching them being performed a farmer's land into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I don't remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I grabbed it and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner of Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and I was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he's scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground\n[noise] were you and your parents separated\nUm five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nSister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from\nGet away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims and uh my father would often even park a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nYou'd always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nOkay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things and put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat for\nWhat he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people I'm ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] [noise] yeah you know\nHe often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode\nThis episode the referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is not expected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time up since ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and [noise] um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected and\nFestive of periods in his life oh essay festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching his works I'm studying is works or even a whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden in the ... to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for that economic crisis\nGuinea and
