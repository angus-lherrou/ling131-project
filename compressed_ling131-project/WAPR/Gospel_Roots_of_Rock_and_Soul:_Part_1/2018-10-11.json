choice I say for sure [noise]\nGimme inches are welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you\nKnow my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and a moon law was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think I'd be the same sort of initial ah you know ... it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible book to the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the Maddox terrain at least two\nWhiplash inland and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to the story of extremes\nAnd we would we would mount though you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nAh and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see office at you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film\nFilm equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later you see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know their body cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know that was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledgeable the real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight still uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh disagree and patient and and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up\nHurting question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from ... we had to\nTake a we had to take a moment no we got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can ... you know I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking um\nUm and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least it wasn't then said can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space helping their land on the moon but if they don't that's in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nDuring Heinz who plays about Gilbert movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh the actual sort of ...\nThe actual sort of format in and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was writing has a ...\n[laughter] you know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country off involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nMy ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and

[noise] I Want to ask you back in ...\nAbout the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing and my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes into that category about of of genre that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices I Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and playing is like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know ruin or might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you [noise]\nWas a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and so the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from divorced shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something I was actually a the ... or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no one in much control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know times\nEarth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to ah you know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called minna Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh uh no\n[noise]\n\n\nNo no no [noise]\nIt's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the leader moon teams in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash\nOn and they found remarkable was that you were working on the land before first man but a lot of them was a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man er and er so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kinda languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a three large stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during and after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nI fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land but as soon as\nAs soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real size and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know la la land with a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know is it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they'd been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film but they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and dad are they gonna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right in pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nDidn't mean to tell thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our show congratulations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gospel Roots of
