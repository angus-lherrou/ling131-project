this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nBut I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy for an in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider that\nThere isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you\n[noise] um I think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing a dramatic place so\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starting in the new movie can you ever forgive me which is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dress and yet um you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do growth that comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it okay and then\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to term it for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and I said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny in kind\nDetermine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we're things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter]\nWhat's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality and by doing gross out scenes and so you're one of these really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it was really\nTalked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting to do [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal and the the the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have three\nParents and they're all called in to meet with the principal and the the the other couple the Leslie manpower a couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him\nWith his car did you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hit him said or you know you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he told me what language Catherine language I mean really what these do not balls said to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake couple was that there are a big commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk is productive I Would like to read and\nMy legs and kick you out in a jar with my ... bone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and it just goes on and on with more over the top insults is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I\nDidn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything so um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHad you improv insults before\nSo much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory how'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just that you literally say anything just to kind of kind of tear people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character you know you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun too I mean it would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and are there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air

I. A.\nDot or this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there\nGay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] ... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your\nJob off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling\nIs you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God I don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um it usually would dissolve into some kind of\nAbout are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road if like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nOut of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels bad like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\n[noise] and they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a fish is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's the light oh ...\nEver present or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men\nI wouldn't flashes climbs up\nYes and when that light flashes is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be\nI came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you're you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know at all of the day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read your kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think or decent too it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nCar all [laughter] I say I'm Phil I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always\nA bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\nI'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet\nFell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were out at for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered and Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward all take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important for me to its its branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air", "show_name": "Gospel Roots of Rock and Soul: Part 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "23"}
