it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration had gone about taking over the federal government what kind of lights a fire under me is when I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting today after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to to receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody debris in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprise it's managing all these risks ... eight imagines but we as a society don't spend much time thinking about\nUm it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and ... would you what happens is you you amplify the risk you you increase the probability of\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk\nThe risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the mother investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nMost of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a tree we had a prize the biggest ... ... ... doesn't function without the

paying much to nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been for us this very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and\nThe public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done were positions aren't being replaced where people\nAre being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and their\nWho have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so

Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions okay well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously\nSuccessful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives\nSave lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over is the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and\nYou know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon as a sexually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo that mean Myers had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearn more about precision cancer treatments that Cancer Center dot com\nSuffering a tire decision God to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions with a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nDirect dot com helping drivers find deliver install\n[noise]\nThe b._b._c. world serve as soon as the world's largest international broadcaster with correspondent school over the world\nThe b._b._c. brings you breaking news analysis kind of information you can hear index interviews documentaries and Cohen tree with a global perspective on the Alabama public radio [noise]\nThe b._b._c.
