pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years or near okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um\n[noise] that can be\nExhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to queens that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics took all the time about their body functions in their ... but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience [noise]\nYeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that when anyone starts doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really started posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I finally got into a place where I can a curse is that allowed now have to

Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm not a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers or you know there were were expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and um you know quite ... to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work around this plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by ... there's a lot of nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes wash his life forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man touch\n'em and pitch will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the end this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiments in that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this is the young men is just completely [noise] you just don't naturally a gifted it uh\nDid it a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch\nBought some you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nA ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy a adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy", "year": "2018", "show_name":
