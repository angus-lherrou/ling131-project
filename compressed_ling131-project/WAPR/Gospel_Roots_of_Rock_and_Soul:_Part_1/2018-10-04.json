feel like a list of all the pros and cons\nWe talked about this with war we would never do it\nNo use for that you would never do it I uh\n[laughter] I kept my mouth shut\nBecause I didn't want to pressure you into something that you were going to have to live with for the rest of your life\nWait so all the time that I'm assuming that we feel the same way about this have been having secret fantasies about egg donation it's not a secret fantasy and it sent me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at science fiction\nIt's not science fiction writer ... it's pretty primitive actually they do it with farm animals all the time\nThat example I'm Sorry\nSo long haul right now with freaking me out I Am not

parts and then my uterine skews\n\nInstead of having your husband insemination you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant and uh it's not your husband it's ...\nAnd it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too and you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and the fertility\nClinic from the point of view Catherine ... figure skating the doctor you're seeing her legs on the ... through her point of view yeah it was one of you so many women have had so many times [laughter] [noise]\nUm yeah and um that I have to um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your ...\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix well\nThat leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer and she has a new\nBook that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies\nAnd her her agent closer and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hunts has no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin has a feminist and the character and and in\nThe novel a undercover there's a woman and there's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green\nAnd it's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAre still solar trade for what\nIn college and then it's ideology ally that I'd have a career\nSpanned out she said and then the bills for Iowa is an idea\nShocking or if I'm going to some for our ambivalent about having a tip [noise]\nKnow you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog was\nBefore you took changing the deadline is lumber\nOh he'll start as soon as I finish the play\nRight after I get the story\nRight after I get the story published I finished the book\nKnowing awful oh I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation\nA lot of women has been a hit forty one\nI just don't think it's Gloria Steinem fault that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid but [noise]\nAll the doctors ever talked about it [noise]\nMy advance the turtle a my old eggs\nIn one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose not face\nSo that was Catherine hunt and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess Temer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and Catherine hon in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's butter and this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like ... ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a licensed to pursue your or to pursue the other\nPursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed\nIs now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of women\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nOf away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of\nOf becoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting out in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that Jews go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which opens in theaters and

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambling he was really like a character so you make three\nFilms two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on\nBased on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing um in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men\nNeed between you know between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well Parenthood during that time has majors so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean it must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there is actually for children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm\n... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me\nUm had been\nLiving abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and I was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Mary in high school for a second and then um\nUm he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him\nHe sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was just you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] that's cool [noise]\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put it in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ...\nYeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off massive mhm so what is it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students [noise]\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nJust an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that that even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary in in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you back on her show thank you so much thank you\n[noise] timer Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters", "show_name": "Gospel Roots of Rock and Soul: Part 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "04"}
