mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding and skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know just wait an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot of films feel\nSome skaters is that you're in like you were going to be a great skateboard her but\nKnow I yes actually okay and I loved it and it was there was such bombastic personality such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on it having written this film\nI loved it and it was there was such bombastic personalities such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens on it having written this film\nHe

physical pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nI'm scars on these guys are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just a general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community is has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff would\nYou have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] ever considered buying an escape or now I landed a\nCase for it in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of

more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation it's set among a group of

all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you be willing\nTo share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer and\nNo Homer see that would be but I Would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K\nWould make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton vice [laughter] when are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't\nKids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder of film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is diversity of and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk show [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a ... I Want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was ... shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this do for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize\nThey were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nNew by our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitments are sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station [noise]\nI'm from western hotels and resorts westerners committed to the wellbeing of travelers with offerings like heavenly beds a super foods are ex menu and gear lending for one workout years left behind at home [noise] west and let's rise learned more what's been dot com and from the NPR wine club where ... ...\nHere's left behind at home [noise] west and let's rise learn more western dot com and from the NPR wine club where members receive NPR inspired wines like weekend edition cabernet and wait wait don't tell me Marlowe available to adults Twenty one years or older\nLearn more at NPR wine club dot org\nThe b._b._c.
