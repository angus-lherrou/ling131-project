{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAPR", "content": "...\n... ... ... ... ... is\nIs [noise]\n\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end the debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurt all the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe mansion isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote\nThe Republican especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend could also say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there is for key votes this is going to be close very I guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUh okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact\nSo we're now going to hear in their entire already over the next few minutes from two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation\nIt is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side at but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated was a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their appointment\nBeen marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brecht and what's the scene like this morning\nThere are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing off to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults mushroom trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime\nDirected that been founded what what they're saying she had said one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well but don't talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well with poison from the outset when President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom a list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care\nAnd achieving a partisan majority\nOn the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee\nShielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public\nJust guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd warning norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conducted the hearing\nThat made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One\nLook fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford\nOn trial only at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly\nTo a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely ... by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of when nominees are brought to the floor\nLeader McConnell could move this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward\nBecause he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats\nWhen it comes to complaining about delaying\nTwo words you never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience there and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they using doctor for the smear campaign\nOf engaging in the politics of personal destruction\nBecause that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful combination\nOf the scorched earth politics\nPractice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to entrench in advance\nJanet vantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nBe recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many years and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo law are on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that this nominee would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far allowed protesters\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yet\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps\nYou're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against it\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nAnd I'll listen to death\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence\nWhen it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no\nOur colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play\nUntil of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's classmates items right earlier this week\nThey'll stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity the absurdity the indignity\nIs our approach to confirm it\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about\nDelay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation mere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction\nAnd so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat there were gross destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jefferson\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice and every time\n... women\nHospital the vulnerable people\nHospital workers same old tricks\nThey all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\n\nReceived and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we're still one vote short as they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat is right in this bill may drag out but this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator\nVote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing out in announcing their votes which very rarely have to leave the United states give a listen to some of that\nLet's bring that up and give a\nListen Maria and ms Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that they're ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central uh to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to the confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell yes and to some degree it\nWould make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare a this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow we're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal OK so Lisa Murkowski is I Know um and so does that mean it's all up to the Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh\nA a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is ... is is fluid entail its final senators can change their minds and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm since the final vote goes until they band together\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware I went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the ruined is it art it but in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the convention a conservative direction for President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nDemocrats already were and you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ... the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is a correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe Manchin is in a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally the not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex Conan has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\n... could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms that the terms are barely a month\nTerms are barely a month away this is a big way in a big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get them to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh on to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\nAre ... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up and the people that are\nKind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans\nAs a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to to succeed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yeah\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there were probably almost certainly be after the election\nI I'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you ... for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWell I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nThe Tuscaloosa symphony orchestra present him Alison majesty side by side with the hugs for symphony Monday
