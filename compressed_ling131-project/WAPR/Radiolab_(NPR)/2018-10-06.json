H. P. R. Selma them you can't pay our muscles shells that your age you know the W A L F them just a little devil you teach history the the Tuscaloosa there'll be sick\nFor a I mean the we are Alabama public radio [noise]\n\nBefore we start today's episode we wanted to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be for one way you\nCan\nYou are listening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something\nHigh [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and the press how many people do we see killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near right Jason Harris than double John or animals become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nThere a is a trending one way or the other or police\nOur police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself and the police\nDepartment it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil burst study had Florida is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing then put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of would show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on this to probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got an broken\nDown by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county\nBooker aton void and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nAnd you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was their chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most\nBasic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well\nQuite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nI mean what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern cells much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for their same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this nasty ask but still just moved by the single case to the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this uh the plumbing investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department to five five but every one of these every report is at least one human life\nSomeone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table that the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right and if I'm\nUs in the region where it was something that I've been in you know here in Florida\nLook at the clubs and\nSo after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the Mondale got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or for no just wanted to know it has been telling everyone about\nThis dinner justice her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but it it must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying\nA way it's a crystal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the large stage at certain point because it was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep\nThan I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to crystal how [noise]\nMidsize one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken\n[noise]\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [noise]\nDifferent summer's wildfire [noise]\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel room again this is talk of Clinton\nDale room again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWe sleep in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over in the first of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of bicyclists shows results like therapy for\nVictims let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add a sex Marlon Branstad [noise]\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nWe usually the video that's now\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police car that came behind them was probably right here and then the officer they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause the guard and with the investigators\nGoing and all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back here it's all you can now what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ...\nTo just brings you right back here mhm yep\n\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\n'cause sometimes for ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan my find the best a lot of what about let me\nCouple of women handed me the phone like this don't do it\n\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all sort of walking back to put the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us because I Know [noise]\nI Know yeah we haven't been I had\nIt was a great fight we saw that last week\nAnd I walk in the morning\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's way with about Fifteen minutes talk about this\nAt home I have to go there all the time of course yeah that would force how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm\nAnd his credit you can go about yeah like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share everything like that are like he literally I think he does he like going to have lunch with every day\nI mean I don't know if you're in a way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that's always sit down\nHe take his chair I'd be able to hold my I Would never [noise]\n\n\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal who was the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nWatched as my daughter was loaded into the ...\nAnd his around this time of the few these women started call themselves the mothers movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nComing up and down the cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between the\nEnd it there\nSo stay with us\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhance the public understanding of science

protein\nAnd you get within like ten feet of the cops\nAnd then [noise] the guy was\nFunny camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has was over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she changed central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nOfficer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep going\nDo you keep coming at me you were lucky\nYou didn't just shot showing your best shot you want to die I Want you want a guy [laughter] you can't die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\n[laughter] [noise] and they're kind of counseling want\nMe to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the un huh\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the point to eat at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into cornstarch that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nHey hey hey this is important as the guy's partner was holding a gun how do you heard that hot you might have to leave reacted thinking I was a gunshot fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they weren't officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a\nBlack man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there was no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood I miss it on the front step waves and ... what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you don't have close to being that wouldn't be back with his medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNow again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nLast say primary election among the Fenway interstate tournaments just ... years now\nHe is now ... county sheriff like shit would was elected the sheriff of Linn county [noise]\n\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing you mentioned is that a job with long says organization called her which is decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being the top is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know maybe I'm just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively\nIt does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had registered realized\nHope has to go\nThat's coming up right after this break so
