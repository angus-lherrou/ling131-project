I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this

I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been

for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up of makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got the\nOther campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski\nAnd because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled the voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol in ... he ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away\nTo to kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help\nSaying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest\nAnd thus began\nWhat was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape served seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday how do you feel at night when the people got panicked\nWhen you're all well one of the doors are shorter ...\nPeople loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving round here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so as a manhunt dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men or\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted gal\nSays Freese or got big on something of that fact and scare started running\nBlocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the foot heroin\nAnd Carol started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back the arm and the\nFoot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nThat you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk and it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor Lisa ... is the conflict\nBetween what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation and we are recording\nSo the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm and he ran to the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York this our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights ... flights like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but\nThen he met Robert De Niro\nLife you're strong back to ... you need a forty five\nAnd but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong man to take him out you need a forty five and uh I just had the feeling that this guy is dangerous a love of the things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nThat Susan pets was in an era event of a\nClosed up mine shaft the mind is up in mind though about an hour south of the hospital ... in that moment where you scared were you excited like oh you you up high it's high but you're scared you're concerned yeah fear your food for you to do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door took of\nDriving that lady friends car to try to lose any too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren McKenna street and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava so that some a road that goes to the miners are what is clear to them on it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this here is used to be an old road [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly seats are no leaves and all the trees were\nBlack and I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that Armenian\nThere were no leaves and all the trees were\nBlack and I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight from the same area that Armenian this is the only way they came in here\nSo here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild trudging choose for is looking for the [noise]\n\nYou spent hours looking [noise]\nUm [noise]\nWe found this was her van slow\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this is getting any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe and blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this ... does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of your\n... back up the\nEventually they'll gee found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when delta G founder so what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers\nTried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's see how that played that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took you know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time this happened um anything that\nOver ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is\nUnder the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there is no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired\nDetectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even as everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you have yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fight as hard as they can for their client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of land or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes and I knew Mr hawk from bowling [noise] who's who's the other daughter my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church and\nOne if you have to be men I'm On a few big ... the parents of the family and your do you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two\nAnd yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n[noise]\nSo now what does she [noise] coming up that hard

I'm A Rod's I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they had found the body\nStory from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move\nWild so they decided to breed bird plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some case yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give them ... ... well that's kinda gross you know\nYeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information as a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nI Do to make a living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think the parade oh look to stress and pressure to choose to do\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and then the state bar is that what Belgian our money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast does what does\nMost of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job\nOr I mean I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nYou will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp [noise] I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you\nAnd in sitting in on these classes and and talk into law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on a phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nWas the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and\nSusan's mother who's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing well she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I\nExplained before my interest really\nIn the story um how to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first thing you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we will with received a phone call at the unease my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas a when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nFather as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic\nIn the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor of law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering ... we've been talking a lot of 'em that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you'd want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree passed you mostly ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just the year before and so to live this\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future's ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nGreat future and that's about it it\n\n\nIt's it's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence that tear if that's OK\n\n",
