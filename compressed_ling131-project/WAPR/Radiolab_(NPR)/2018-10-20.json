H. P. R.\nSound that he'll be are nice those shows\nW. H. I. L. movie W A L F in Tuscaloosa\nW ... being the Tuscaloosa\nEighteen thankful I mean now we are we are we are we I we are Alabama public radio [noise]\nAre you what you know and\nYou're listening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to make someone on it yeah anyway\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please ... [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo ah December twenty seventh sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter] yes [laughter]\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that right there are you there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling the\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want and Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise]\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered or is now in what would become a loud Facebook do Facebook rockets\nIn global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nAny violence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say it again\nBut I'm just like ... to ... we can see and what we can see that Mueller right kids in front of me\nOn the Internet [noise]\n\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr sack of arc I got to\nDo you subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that\nThink about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow [laughter] which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning in two thousand eight the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\nBecause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to read\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees [noise] All right ready\nSo at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to thousands\nSeismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face is now than a website in the U.S\nFacebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their ... to Facebook and a leg meaning like I use their saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nPiece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEvery time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your ... leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry that that the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[noise] rise up fight for the rights that rather than the\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nThe title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on social networking website is under fire for a new policy on photos of women threatened meeting their children taught him twelve thousand\nAnd it caught on the social networking website is under fire for it and how long the on some of them women threatened leading their children taught him twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face of a\nBasement and he is now I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post so\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand people\nThere's a floor in the building where states but as far as his content moderators itself\nAround twenty tend they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and draw as well as\nI mean I Would guess that there are things people building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stuck scene where they get there still is Facebook treats cooked everybody's fever English and we\nSent them there to try to talk to some of these people who for living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we were just curious like what's what's that like [noise] well\nI'm getting some questions are generally we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of running late for me happening\nA lot about it but now I I started by these you know sorry\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing are willing to talk\nDo you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather lie that's totally fine you know I just go straight up your\nKicks plain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to find these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct\nStating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract flew about ...\nMind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worth that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it create a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I knew I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I didn't really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have all yeah until you go through so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nLike like like ignore ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five ... every day it was just image and efficient and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nI don't know if that's just like ... or it's too I think the ... extra added a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nThat we had to explode able to you know get the latest squashed by attached to you know people cages it was ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely ... percent um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat were there were specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like OK says Clinton's ... ... S C I was like okay and what I was like I had to wear exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just I had to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that I it's it's classic adjusted\nI I was too real [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's classic adjusted\nUh different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more of this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or terrorist propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that but yeah the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of uh terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming up but it will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be jokes and readers hey All right okay I'll go with it so we take a break and come right back I think we should\nHi this is Janine calling from Lima through radio lab is supported by transfer wise an online service that lets people send and receive money internationally and their border list the countless customers Holden convert multiple currencies anytime more transfer wise dot com and the\nShade African Dina radio a lot he supported by target presenting future at heart podcast and change makers and the project their tempting in communities nationwide future at high level on apple\nBought tasks or whatever broadcaster found\n\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nDance and things and iron Dale serving Alabama since Nineteen Seventy nine with complete selections of dance where and points you including professional fitting\nWalk in and dance out the vote held part of the UAB health system offering beat my Medicare education events in various locations across the state details such as dates in locations can be found at one eight hundred\nSix three three one five for two or one seven one one for AT T T Y users [noise]\nThat one eight hundred six three three one five for two or one seven one one ...

story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are there's those you're just tuning in this episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because the kids in the room might want to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe and ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty ...\nHey Rhonda Marilyn thanks very sorry for them to get up that you can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before it's\nThank you I mean how can break we had some breaking news uh otherwise it wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYou as sort of the dust begins to federal\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured picks them up rose him in a wheelchair\nAnd as they are pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud that there's a photographer there any snaps is\nAnd the photo shows the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nCBS fee and we used to be on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published\nOn line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but\n[noise] pretty quickly [noise] voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however\n... in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the room says no the other people are saying this is newsworthy\n\nEssentially this photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on with not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this do which the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nIn other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down\nBut before they can pull the lever words start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive under the soccer Briggs sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\nHuh\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah ... and\nThis brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap book for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organizations strength parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million\nRecently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of
