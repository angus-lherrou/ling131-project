Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in him a next door pretty thrilling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty\nOne I was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage vertical or you know free syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that are still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card was written by this guy ...\nIt's written by this guy ... who was a poet nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd then he wrote a poem for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something and this poem was supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first yeah okay\nIt's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak sucking lady a sec young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't look boom through ... ... ... ... to beat them all calculate known to have ... to\n... onto the top ... to ... told my dad who to a tree pond about it they held on for ... to ... ... ...\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks when you were I was really [laughter] exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years publishers for [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy none of us who doesn't look\nIf you just focus on the words that basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president ...\nPiece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed eat some jam movie too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped tailed dog units are like get better here's to your good health\n... to ...

folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians of meeting yeah [noise]\nAnd it actually is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time oh this is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting\nBecause he was he didn't even have a high school education you know\nEven have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling\nAnd one of GOP next favorite curling her and I really like this one is about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words that hide the truth I don't like wars that conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality and Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both as he\nCalled and we I've known people in this country no morals people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these\nSenior citizen\nAnd he was unsaid but that's the reason we use ...\nI just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just want your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Karlan is real point was that it it might Dole's our\nReactions to it that

C. N. G. that's it but he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy\nMore than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proceeds yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like\nHow to those four simple base has become the assets to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code\nProblem ... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC did you keep it secret and then out\nComes the protein what what simple toad could I Do to do that\nAnd just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out side\nI think that ourselves read our genes three basis at a time\n[noise] like instead of a T. C. G. A. C. came out that maybe it's a TA CGI DCA AC a G ...\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not parents because if you have said the three or rather than to game I figured well that give mathematically would give me more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Selma", "day": "13"}
