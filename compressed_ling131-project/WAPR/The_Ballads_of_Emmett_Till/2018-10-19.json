David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was a guy who build and sold his first home before he reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes you're by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers are actually in the country and what he specialized in was building middle class housing whose homes which he built in his apartment buildings which rebuild and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens were coming to use no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the the Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens who's a him so he had an enormous skill building middle class\nThe the Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and had his uh him so he had enormous skill building middle class housing and he also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties and especially with the return of the GIs from World war two and he would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap\nInto ten billion dollar empire that remained\nFor the most part the dominant narrative that he sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very a way\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk\nMore about how Donald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged incest backpack schemes as he reaped riches\nThree writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollars on from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump in laws\nAnd we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans now one million I'm In today's dollars acquaintance two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to for Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from God and then being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nTo use the money for many of his ranch or see how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support died it was used to support\nYeah he use the money for\nMany of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to his father these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments it\nAlso see that when his so and then when he would fall ... was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money and it's very animated million dollars' worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald is the sole executor fried Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump andme area and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well has dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nIn charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\nSo what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that for Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after a break we'll talk about another

let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne crack and David Barstow\nThat's progressive this\nIs fresh air and let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne ... and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published along investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died down on Trump to lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo so that the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that dot sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and ...\nSo it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an honor\nTheir looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just an estate tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art or the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this\nWhat are you thinking David or of a comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly with the moment when he's just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the Mets have how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nIn that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've\n... dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America um but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um\nResetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spend a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room um who cleaned it who\nIs allowed to go [laughter] you know [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] but we uh yeah it was\nJust the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy\nWas only ripen their ... and it'll cost are phobic too I Would imagine [laughter] and other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um if people\nKnew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to
