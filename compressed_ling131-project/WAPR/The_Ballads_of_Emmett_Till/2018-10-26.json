human athletic flash many of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to soccer club yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money does college basketball generate well\nBillions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites and all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and what does the money go\nThe money largely goes to the adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches make as much as a half million dollars a year all throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nAbout a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself which is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports but the money that that tournament\nA year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports\nBut the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences that they're actually paying the players\nThey're exploited their dealers in human athletic flesh and they are trying to get their hooks into kids and get their hooks into families\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball we'll continue our conversation after a short break this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresher and we're speaking with journalist Michael ... has a new book about corruption in recruitment in college basketball it's called the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nSo in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this it's the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant\nCollege coaches are the sort of ones who\nFirst make contact with a young player and his family they\nFly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches that used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball that you win\nIn July and that means you win games by getting the best players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in the industry and\nAmong journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coach of say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know these\nAssistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep their hard to get back into business if you lose the job the temptation\nTo cheat is extreme\nBut she had these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government just\nAre sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there is another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\n[noise] but then in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the intent of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros send them to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you manage to have for in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of the ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more\nSo if you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or can over those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars\nIf I were a future NBA player or with a family of a future NBA player I don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded there are special\nSystem of people who serve professional athletes\nManage their money or if you get traded their specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house and and interior designer so sports is a very insular business and\nA lot of the players want to deal with known quantities\nAnd part of this is there's the money manager he manages NBA players money so the game is to become one of those guys and then they have one of these go between set you up with\nA with players\nMichael ... new

couple of leadership books um but it's not really a model of of leader that most people would recognize employees a sort of circular logic when things go wrong\nAnd in the case of stripper gate and

recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried were convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nIt was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents and coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time that was a shock\n... and has it had a major effect on college basketball program some in Louisville certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it is not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so the one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke which is quoted as saying this is a blip\nThis is nothing you know this trial is nothing um it's a small sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but the fact that coach K set it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what what's really at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean\nKind of sports does not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars and it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships\nDoesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you were you were having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier um you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations is a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nDo think it will make some difference but I think the difference will be\nJust in the way that people\nConduct possibly criminal activity I think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them\nYou know talking about you know we have to do this in some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity I think they'll become more careful\nSunny the ... the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grass roots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries where you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive\nThis is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know it will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean you said that in some respects shooting apparel companies look pretty bad in this what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in\nThese charges the\nApparel companies have been very quiet they've put out sort of vanilla statements that this is not what we do a but they've been very very quiet\nThere is a ... executive who is one of the three current defendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and finally James ghetto who this is ... executive his father was a high school coach\nHe's an insider he's a basketball insider almost all of these defendants are well liked well known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they\nWere part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they're planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us\nThank you it's great to be on with you\nMichael ... new book is the last temptation of
