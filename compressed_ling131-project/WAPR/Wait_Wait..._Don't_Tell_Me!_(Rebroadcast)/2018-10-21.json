Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us money they either the narrative has changed so many times it's election cycle are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started the tipping where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to do right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and taxes there just happen to be more Republicans there\nWe started this cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is that those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe've entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things the Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed in I I think it's just hard to tell especially in\nA midterm where it seems legitimate that enthusiasm is higher than before we just don't know what that means in terms of who shows up to vote compared to typical midterm\nWe dive into one story this week they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here on to be with us so we're on the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week\nRon Elving here I'm going to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as White House counsel why don't you start by just explaining what his job wise and white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of these he is already out of his office in the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from of Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else\nHe will be replaced by another Washington DC attorney pat simple Loni or who is well known in Republican legal circles but while simple Loni is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an avid flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly are working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for a vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nI feel like as I'm listening to describe all of a sudden it just feels Harry insider aid to me right in terms of who's who and who they all watch for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over the last well connected guy in a pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks um is that fair that\nIt is a totally fair assessment it but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be heard and when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton cog in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a firing various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nThat's a report that's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court in appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nIt take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller um McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nIndeed he did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation\nIsn't that right yes indeed he did\nAnd that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the Mueller investigation or in a year if at all possible\nUh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign all that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of the twenty sixteen Trump campaign\nOr does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood he has been\nHandling much um the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative arrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you though about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency\nBut if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stopped and the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity be speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution in the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lunch never been easy but it's never been more important\nAlright well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's been happening thank you Ron\n...

Americans against each other\nLawmakers have no doubt that Russia is trying to influence our mid term election\nThey were doing twenty sixteen they're still doing it today\nIn fact this week the Justice Department charged a Russian woman with interfering in the election it's the first such charge we've seen the campaign cycle our democracy itself is in the crosshairs intelligence officials say they're doing everything they can't protect the four hundred thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the ballot but with less than ...\nIntelligence officials say they're doing everything they can't protect the four hundred thirty five house and thirty five Senate seats on the ballot but with less than three weeks until the mid term\nHave social media giants and the federal government done enough to deter foreign influence\nJoining me now to talk about all of this is NPR's Ryan Lucas Carrie Johnson and Phil Ewing everyone high higher so let's start with that Russian woman who was charged on friday that's forty four year old a late ... a carry who who why she and what exactly was she accused of doing\nShe's from St Petersburg Russia She still inside Russia and she's basically been accused of acting as the accountant\nFor a company that's been conducting information warfare in us elections in elections in other countries as well in these new criminal charges filed on friday\nUm the authorities say that she was part of an operation to target us elections up to and including these November twenty Eighteen midterms by disparaging certain political candidates pumping up other is buying ads on Facebook and other social media sites\nAnd basically trying to sow divisions within the U.S on all those hot button issues\nThings like a gun rights algae Beatty writes a race relations in any number of other things to be real clear just and one thing that you mentioned Kerry is that she is in Russia so uh it's not as if the United States Department of justice can force her to come to the U.S and we'll have a trial right I mean what does this mean that they've charged her\nThis is part of an ongoing naming and shaming operation the Justice Department and the FBI or doing basically they're trying to let these Russians now we're onto you we see what you're doing we sell we were doing and twenty sixteen we see what you're doing up to this day we want to make it hard for you to go on vacation to places\nWhere the U.S might have extradition treaty then one day maybe we'll get lucky will now be and bring you back here to us to face justice\nAnother thing that I think is is important about this was sort of the the fact that the public gets to hear about what the Russians are doing it it informs the public so that they have a better idea of what to look out for a and this is not something that the public had the sort of knowledge and the run up to the twenty sixteen election so this way the public is\nCan be more than four to keep an eye out for possibly fake news and fake social media can so that's you know they can be aware of such things\nOne more point on these court papers that were unsealed on friday this cases being pursued by the U.S attorney's office in the eastern district of Virginia and the Justice Department proper and this is not being pursued by the special counsel team and one signal\nBy the U.S attorney's office in the eastern district of Virginia and the Justice Department proper and this is not being pursued by the special counsel team and one significant thing about that is that those folks are going to continue to be employed those folks in the U.S attorney's office and it may just as headquarters in DC\nOf the week [noise] running for United States Senate\nAnd these are held we will never know why and if we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on the runway in the country then indicative of a larger theme playing out in elections around the country this week we're going to look at the third congressional district of New Jersey I'm here with NPR diminish ... and let's bring in Joe Hernandez\nHe's a reporter at W. H. Y. Y. Joe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you could start with you can you know it's just a way of the land start with the basics if who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare in one support from House Republicans of course it didn't become law and\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that he's running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on the national Security Council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so talk a little bit about what it's like\nWell both of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so MacArthur had a fundraiser with vice president Pence and former vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kim\nThere's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it is it a little bit more detail about who lived in this district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district\nWhen you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nThe Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times but it looks like the race is much much tighter this I mean even if you're a little bit about why Democrats see this as potentially vulnerable feet\nWhen you saw MacArthur you know really go all in on that repeal effort I and this amendment that he put forward and the contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nSo health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district it it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because MacArthur authored this amendment\nTo the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current healthcare structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip from twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it\nIn their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September\nDemocrats this time around are using it\nIn their favor as the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those were pro ac eight and a New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September were\nHealthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr a line that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on her back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that NPR
