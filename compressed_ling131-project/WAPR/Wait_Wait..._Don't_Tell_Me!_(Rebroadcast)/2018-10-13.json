episode a guy walks into a psychiatrist's office yeah uh did you think well this is going to be an enormous cultural phenomena little chain letters on for decades to come oh my God you're bait and\nSo one of the things that we knew and we actually back in the day interviewed some of the actors in the show and one of the things that everybody would hear about is that every actor in the Sopranos was terrified\nThat some day the David Chase or the other producers would say come here we got to talk to you and they let you know that you were gonna get worked for that is right or your character they didn't actually kill any actors as far as I Know\nOne of the guys who got killed and I will not say all of a sudden after that episode they started getting all these letters from Japan saying oh why did you kill off someone's oh blah blah blah which seems sort of unusual and after a period of time it was all traced back to the actor\nHas got to hand it to him\nHe tried he trying to get to some credit so you went right from the Sopranos and you did this as well I don't know who's right from the front as soon as ... as you did this new show on Showtime called nurse Jackie which\nI think about
