[noise]\nFirst journalist making McCarron talks about her article ... of authenticity is killing ...\nThe current argue the Tex Mex is an authentic was cheap rip off of Mexican cooking barbecue joints are flourishing and demanding high prices mom and pop Tex Mex eateries are closing down [noise] Megan how are you good how are you a good\nUh let's start with if possible a loose definition of when you say Tex Mex food ... what what are you actually talking about\nSell a loose definition of Tex Mex\nIs it's\nCooking developed in Texas um originally as often a ranch food in Texas back when Texas was not very urban\nBy people often of Mexican descent um or who are they how does you know who've been in\nTexas in our family settled in Texas before Texas was part of the u._s. um that's using their local ingredients and more kind of Mexican influenced cooking styles and dishes and food that\nIs Mexican but it's also Texan and it's really fundamentally a regional cuisine of Texas\nSo there are a few ingredients that really a defined Tex Mex ... versus let's say traditional Mexican cooking what what would be some of those ingredients\nInterestingly one of those ingredients is human\nIn San Antonio there's actually a small but significant population people who came from the Canary Islands and the thought is that there's so much human in Chile and therefore started moving forward a lot of Tex Mex\nCooking because of the influences that specific cuisine of the Canary Islands and the chili pick keen which is a native Chile to Texas is also very important ah beef\nA flour tortillas and you know more recently yellow cheese and like sometimes even Velveeta you know you want to make a great case saw at home like get some Velveeta and get a can of roe towel combine those two things got some chips\nSome chips and like you have a great party you know I I think you can make ... with packaged foods\nWell a lot of people have written the Taco Bell et cetera had an adverse effect on Tex Mex\nBecause branded Tex Mex is being fast food cheap food right so so Tex Mex whether one direction at least for a while\nYeah I think it's very much like an upside down cake\nThat you cook in a cast iron skillet\nAnd there yeah ... but you can also do put like peaches are ... are you learning about um butter and sugar and fruit and you cook that down and you read the batter to it but this is just the basic skills cake where you melt the butter\nAdded to the bad or put it back in I think still a parks her new book Braveheart has a ... for these she's the Baker for serious eats dot com yes and you can actually go to Syria seats and she has a couple of recipes for I think these kind of cat yeah these kind of cakes and she's really by the way she's a really good Baker it's great book\nOkay well I'll start there I don't I had no luck so far this will be a good and I really really thanks for your time\nOkay Laurie thanks Lori I\nThank you guys but I\nYou know that's really sad thing is that grandmothers take recipes with him to the grave very often the purpose of I Know they do because they don't want anybody to be able to make it I Know that particularly do they want to be

Christopher Kimball\nIn Nineteen Seventy five maybe shirts and became the first female restaurant critic at the New York times\nAnd went on to reinvent the genre using disguises to get an honest meal also employing a smart literary style of writing today shares in his Ninety two years old and with no plans to retire she's currently a columnist at the Daily Beast and just launched a new special series with the sport full podcast maybe how are you\nI'm very well very well\nI I don't want to rehash too many things everyone knows but ah in December Seventy five you became the food critic clear at times and uh the person who hired you was a woman who didn't think a woman should be the food critic for the times is that correct\nOr not quite the woman who wouldn't hire may was a woman of an ardent feminist and it took five more years for Joan ... men who was then the editor of the section to call me up and asked me to come in for an interview\nThe woman who wouldn't hire me did not hire may name was Charlotte Curtis\nThe woman who did hire may was John Whitman and of course hired by the editor of the paper a Rosenthal\nYou still remember both of those names [laughter] well ... fortunately for all of us you became a critic\nUh first of all the very artificial way of eating 'cause you go with the crowd everybody orders different foods you get the taste you can't just enjoy one thing or two things you have to try to eat everything obviously has critic\nIs that something you eventually get used to and and get to like or is it always a a burden that is you would prefer not to have to do that\nNever mind that I rather enjoyed it because I was really interested\nTo know what I Would find out and I think when you do it that way you kind of know how to separate flavor is in your mind it was however something that I knew I had my husband and once in a while when we went out together he said do you think we could\nWe could eat the same thing tonight and have a ship experience\n[laughter] yeah well it sounds like me [laughter]\nSo we did but unless it was a restaurant like Chinese or Indian where people often do go with the crowds uh\nWas never more than four people and usually just my husband and myself on the first try to see what's going to be worth reviewing before we filed a lot of people and expense into it\nI Know that other critics after you at the times got a lot of press in about dressing up in disguise is but you are the I think the first one to really do that I I Love this quote a ... you said even before the Internet I was recognized a few times\nThey are very few things more Baron seen the show up in the wake of glasses and have the owners say quote good evening Mr\n[laughter] exactly I Would say [laughter]\nYou didn't know what to do shit I flip off they'll dig should I you know play its author and I had glasses\nAnd wigs I didn't I didn't wear strange outfits though\nNow let's talk about one of my favorite topics a crowd sourcing vox pop Eli et cetera you're pretty clear that today I think you quote we have a lot of voices that I think are not worth listening to particularly ones from consumers which really what Yelp and so on\nAre so right I I actually\nAgree with you but maybe you could take on the burden of explaining why you think you're right\nWell first of all I don't know how qualified they are to have a trustworthy opinion but even more I have never seen and I'm willing to be wrong on this I have never seen any such service require proof that the person has been a good point\nI haven't gotten him in the past not for a long time just as on a mailing list or an example of many years ago\nThe question is from the gap saying asking me to be a responder with all the things the frail and\nAnd I thought how do they know if I'd been there I've even ask Tim's a gaffe that and he said we have a way to which I say baloney because you could just a ... if it's a friend who owns the restaurant or a relative\nOr if you just want to sound often use you repeat that kind of rating from your local critic just to have a voice in there so\nI don't really care what those people say\nWhat those people say\nYeah that that's true I mean social media you see all sorts of strange comments and\nTheir access to the ground all over so let's talk about casual dining I think you and I come out of the same place you walk into a restaurant and the first Fifteen or thirty seconds what are some of the things that the you'll notice I won't either good or bad\n\nOh I might notice the number of help on the floor I might notice if a lot of people at the table seem agitated and are moving around a lot I Would certainly notice how many tables are empty\nI might notice the overall age of the people I might notice if there are serving stations around the room I'll tell you a funny story about that there is a super\nGreek Dinah in Chicago known as ... and it's right near the American to exchange in the stock exchange and it opens four or five in the morning because the traders are working with people in Asia and so on\nAnd the food is just larger than life\nAt the breakfast and I want one morning alone because I was writing about Chicago restaurants I went around eight thirty and I had to stand on line a little and as he does the owner or his manager gives out little boxes of I'm a\n... a candy what do they call it any way to to women standing on the line and finally after about Fifteen minutes I became the head of the line and the manager came over to me and said where is your place\nAnd I said what place and he said you're a restaurant I said I don't have a restaurant what makes you think so he said the way your eyes were working the room\nHuh [laughter] I really didn't for [laughter] it's like a gambler in a casino like you look around the middle studs\nIs what they gave out in the little boxes to any lady on the line and you know it was super food everybody who ordered breakfast got\nA cooked pruning a slice of orange and a little cup of yogurt no matter what you would if I imagine it's still the same but it was wonderfully observant of this man to notice my eyes working the room mark\nI um you like Joel ... Shaw a and his cooking when you talk about his famous\n... I think is that when you just put wind would beef it apart it takes a lot of the flavor out of the meat the meat is hardly flavor was and the wind isn't rich and ... it's kind of just the city can kinda nasty actually\nSo I don't know how they're used to doing Italy but it doesn't work now here so we bought this in the kitchen what do we do\nSo critically really took the wind out of the equation and in fact we took all the liquid out of the equation and so we have really big pieces of beef they're two inch chunks of beef really heavily seasoned with salt and especially pepper and we put that in a pot with some aromatic\nAnd no liquid here the only liquid that we're going to use to brace is neat comes from the meat itself\nThere's no wind no water no bras nothing to kind of do the flavor so you end up with a really concentrated meat juice\nAnd you're not ... before you put it in just you cook the ... a little bit then put the meeting but you're not doing anything else will lead before because\nWe're not that we found a really cool way to kind of get the flavor of saw tend to me without actually having to do the work which you know we love around here so instead of cooking at the whole time covered we take the cover off after a couple of hours and let it cook for the last hour uncovered and that allowed us to get some browning underneath there\nThat you would have gotten if you were taught to hate it at the beginning but without all the work\nSo what about the one to the ones not in the ones waiting in the wings but it's going to come back to the recipe at the end I Hope\nIt does so what we found was if we added the wine at the beginning really diluted not only the flavor of the ... the kind of made a meat tastes a little weird as well\nSo we waited until the very end to add that so we take them eat out of the pot strain off the juices we had the wine let that cook for a little while and then add those strangely chooses to that and really creates a really nice flavorful rich sauce\nSo this recipe that can be from peppers do almost no prep work cook a little use tomato paste the meat in three hours of the up and take it out reduced some warning through that any are done\nIt's amazing and it takes great taste so good when thank you You're welcome\nYou can get this recipe for a Tuscan beef and ... do have one seven seven milk street dot com\n\nOn ... and you're listening to milk streets radio coming up next Steve amused considers a new way to think about pairing wine and food and we'll be right back\nSupport for Christopher crumbles milk street comes from regal where\nNo street comes from regal where makers of Nineteen Nineteen cookware cooking happens in the kitchen but life happens around the kitchen table American stainless and non stick cook Ware learn more at Nineteen Nineteen cookware dot com\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nThe University of montebello giving students the chance to explore where they belong inside and outside the classroom on line at you belong at Monticello dot com\nEl ... lounge in old ...
