[noise]\nUh if it's cold [noise]\nUm my favorite story though which I Will repeat or radio since you wrote about it was it the Montessori school and you had a you had a child who who bit lot who was a biter\nAnd you decided because when you say I think what your sister when you for her or you used to buy back and you actually bit him back\nAnd I don't know why I guess it's not funny but the idea of Alice Waters and the Montessori school biting back a child who's a biter just I don't know it just struck me somehow so ... ... exactly what happens\nIt happens very impulse I must have been used shipping around really young children and I certainly hadn't been around any that were misbehave and I didn't know what to do\nAnd I was about twenty six years old and I I had to learn the ... message tonight tried\nTo interest him in ... you know the projects and he just\nWouldn't stop and I ... when he heard another child I just grabbed his arm I [noise] I didn't I didn't hard [laughter] but I was ashamed that I did that and um\nI thought that I was ...\n[laughter] but I was ashamed that I did that and um\nI thought that I was I was being let go from the school because of that incident\nBut in fact it was instead because I was wearing\nRather risk ... last [laughter] see through blouse [laughter]\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen of milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipe pasta controversial\nJim how are you I'm doing great it's cost them being day hearing milk strayed it is about ... or as a lot of people say ... [laughter] but look this recipes in hundreds of times I've done it many times you've done it but you went to Italy to see if there was something new or something that we don't\nKnow here yeah you know it is such a simple dish and\nI guess that's what attracted me to it because they're such simple ingredients but they have\nAn amazing amount of flavor and ... that they bring to the table and it didn't hurt that I learned it at this crazy winery that used to be owned by the mafia apparently the government took it away from the mafia and gave it to a retired stolen art inspectors to run in the meantime of course of course because it's asleep\nAnd as it turns out his personal chef was willing to teach me basic rustic Sicilian cooking and this was one of the dishes she taught\nThe minute I walked into her kitchen I was just blown away by the richer Rome is a federal and Rosemary and garlic and it turns out that what she had done is frozen ... into a pot that had been soaked overnight threw in some wild federal but she grabbed from the driveway of the winery\nA ton of Rosemary and garlic cook to them away\nAnd when the beans were done tossed and some pasta started altogether and it was a ... good for such a simple collection of ingredients to have such an amazing flavor profile there were layers of richness and creamy and yet there was no dairy in it so why is this different than the eighty\nSuch an amazing flavor profile they were layers of richness and ... and yet there was no dairy in it so why is this different than the eighty nine versions we've all been through a lot of years I think the problem with most versions is that the focus is on the basics here\nThe beans are kind of like a starchy counter punch to the rich federal the rich Rosemary and the garlic I mean those are really the dominant flavors that you're getting and they're married in this kind of like ... starchy liquid from the beans and from the pasta itself\nAnd so the result is really rich and creamy an aromatic and again for such a simple group of ingredients it just has an amazing impact and flight so I assume when we got back here did you make any alterations to the ...\nWe did we made a couple of first of all we simplified it for week Nike's we used ... and we were very happy with the results because in part the can't have that structure water you need to get the creamy sauce that we were looking for\nThe other thing we did was we found it was a little heavy and we wanted to lighten it up with that and I'd eaten the dishes second time elsewhere in Sicily and that time the woman making it added some tomatoes which we liked so we borrowed that to kind of bring a little bit of a city to it\nAnd finally we felt that a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest also helped hide everything together is right there and also really played well with the Rosemary\nSo political social and like I say you know a basic recipe but now authentic and a much more interesting and also not very difficult no it's very simple jammed thank you thank you you can find this recipe in all of our recipes one seven seven milk street dot com\nI'm Chris Kimball you're listening to milk street radio coming up to impassioned forms an on air experiment demonstrating how sound effects taste we'll be right back\nSupport for Christopher ... milk street comes from Ferguson Ferguson bath kitchen and lighting gallery proudly supports milk street and calling area crusaders everywhere bath kitchen and lighting collections in several styles available in store and online at ... dot com\nChristopher ... is ... by the PKK media publisher of Tuesday nights and new cookbook with over two hundred quick recipes from all over the world look straight changed the way you cook visit us at one seven seven milk street dot com\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors gold stains diamond jewelry since Eighteen Seventy nine\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nGold stains diamond jewelry since Eighteen Seventy nine in Mobile Alabama between hearts on fire jewelry located on Hillcrest road in at ... dot com\nEl Rey burrito lounge in old ...
