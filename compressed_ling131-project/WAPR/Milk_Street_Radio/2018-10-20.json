Appalachia and that we're in this monoculture um [noise] the current generation and this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated [laughter]\nUm [laughter] and we are irritated ... mostly because everything he thinks Rob scotch Irish [noise]\nBefore my interview with one thing I checked with mark landscape well known for his book such as hard and soft now his latest book her landscape tells the story of milk [noise]\nHow are you I'm great how are you ah well I'm thrilled to talk to you um I read cod was my first ... book a long time ago on your latest book milk I also\nAh well I'm thrilled that talk to you um I read cod was my first ... book a long time ago on your latest book milk I also found to be at least is interesting is caught\nSo let's start at the beginning I guess the philosophy people believe that the world started with a huge drop of milk\nYeah I mean a lot of cultures have creation myths that involved a meal and I guess it's not surprising because milk is associated with child birth so it's the beginning of life\nWell but but some of those examples were great in the north legend the huge frost ogre sustained by cow made from falling frost vicious new churned to see of milk to create the universe it it was more don't don't try this at home [laughter]\nI can hear in a glass of milk I guess it's going to military um the thing you say is interesting is that what forty percent of Chinese today drink milk\nYeah which is interesting because that's actually the world average about forty percent of people in the world drink milk about sixty percent of the people in the world are lactose intolerant\nBut but the theory was and you explain that you need lactase to digest lactose in milk and the theory was the Europeans do not have the gene the cuts off the production of lactase when you get older well everybody\nIs supposed to everybody who when they get to about two years old this enzyme lactase is supposed to ah\nStop working and then lactose become sins adjustable some people and that tends to be a Europeans middle Easterners subcontinent have a genetic mutation where this doesn't happen and that's why they can drink milk\nIt's interesting that this mutation that we have is presented as normal and the normal people are presented as having an illness [laughter] that's true actually lactose intolerance says is what's supposed to be friends\nUm you said there was just a shocking numbers at Eighteen hundred it was a Dublin hospital that had a Ninety nine point six percent infant mortality rate\nOkay I wouldn't worry about it no I wouldn't either a supermarket eggs are very well clean there's a film on the outside of an egg when you harvest it yeah it definitely feels different right and it protects the eggs from air getting in to the egg\nBut the supermarket eggs are that's rinsed off and then they read oiled them or they put something on the outside to protect the egg but they're very very well clean\nChristmas right to stay outside of the that really need to make sure gets cleaned you know it's one of those things you know you want to say the over eighty the under five and the immune impaired perhaps should not have these eggs in leather taken to at least one sixty but I think other than that\nYou know you're fine you know just don't leave them out forever and the good thing about your legs it's they're really fresh which means they'll beat up beautifully because they are so fresh\nI think you still have to appreciate it take you think you'd be addressed\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball if you have a cone or a question please give us a call at eight five five four to six Ninety four three that's a five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email questions at ... radio dot com\n[noise] Hi this is Terri Hi how are you I'm fine how can we all do well I\nRemember hearing on your show I think a very simple recipes great grade\nOr something to put on steak when you're grilling it\nYou don't have a grand that molasses friends and I looked and looked\nTo try and find something like that and wondering if they can give me some ideas of ways ... and very simple recipes like for really chicken or steak or eight and vegetables anything like that\nYeah you can um it's available on almost any supermarket now my ... which is the brand we so we think is the best but how do you spell that am Y. M. O. U. and puffy\nAnd that's great but for grill you're probably doesn't matter I Would just brush it on either in the last thirty seconds of grilling straight up straight up or as soon as it comes off the grill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn the other thing I Do with pomegranate ... said a small amount to\nOr as soon as it comes off the\nGrill you don't want it on very long 'cause it'll burn the other thing I Do with pomegranate ... is that a small amount to vinegar ... her dressing it's as you know is sweet and sour and they just had tremendous jobs to that so those are two of the things I Do with it and just as an ingredient sometimes I'll put a little it is to\nJust to add a little bit of deaths sort of a secret ingredient\nBy any kind of meats do I find meat and pomegranate ... go well together any beef stew parks do lamb stew at the end you can put in a tablespoon of Palmer ... just to add a little depth to it nobody will know what it is but it just adds flavor\nIf you're adding and a little bit of sweet and sour yeah\nI find it's probably one of the most useful pantry staples I have if you want to make a tip of some kind or he goes well in Greek yogurt you can add a little bit to that along with some fresh herbs or other things other spices but I Would say lazy and vinegar threats and adding to students are three things I Do Sarah\nAt all of that sounds good to me I mean for people who don't know what pomegranate ... like it's a little bit like ... what I might do for a ... combined it with a little bit of butter and some Dijon mustard and then just put it on in the end yeah maybe a little bit of garlic\nNow you're French or fight it but I Do [laughter] All right Terry thanks very fondly on yet\nListening to the radio I'm

next we are Alabama public radio\n[noise]\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball Rodney ... years driving around Appalachia in search of the region's history recipes and traditions ... book ... recounts her journey exploring everything from Chile bonds to a dozen different types of local beings\nRenee how are you\nI'm well Chris how are you I'm good I'm ... let's talk about ... what is it an amalgam of a million different kinds of things if he were to describe it is there a way to describe it to make sense or is just too diverse\n[noise] um the way to describe it makes sense says to accept that it's complicated and a moving target somewhat um and and that you can shape parameters around it but those parameters some time shift also ah the territory that I looked at\nEnded at West Virginia and it goes down and shoot the northern edge of South Carolina I'm In the mountains of north Georgia and Alabama and of course ah Kentucky and Virginia and Tennessee and North Carolina\nAnd if I left anybody out please don't hurt me sounds [laughter] with 'em and so so even the geographic definition a can stretch and come together\nDo you you drove a van right is that right when you drive and I have a van it's a Chevy astro [laughter] so how many miles how long you set out to do this trip is this a pilgrimage um what were you looking for and how long were you doing\n[noise] honestly I'm not sure what the ... which is at one point I said four thousand miles and then I started looking back at my records and it's really a lot more than that [noise] so it was quite it was it was very literally in Germany you know the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipe\nMy records and it's really a lot more than that so it was quite it was it was very literally a journey into the subtitle is an Appalachian Journey what's recipes\nAnd that was important to me because a lot\nOf what is written and has been written about um the people and the culture and the food ways of Appalachia\nWell a lot of comments from one person's perspective and their family but there are their experiences and Appalachian I wanted this book to reflect those as well we hear the mythology of Appalachia is that we're at this monoculture hum\nThe current iteration of this is that we're all scotch Irish and we're all irritated um [laughter] and we are irritated but mostly because everybody thinks rough scotch Irish [laughter] um so they're they're actually the last census\nThere are more people in southern Appalachia who identify as Latino are African American that there are who identify as being predominantly scotch Irish\nAnd part of my point my interest is that if you look at the food way\nYou can start to pick apart the complexity and see all the strands of it and see how it comes together and it will challenge um some of the assumptions that we've made many of the assumptions that we've made about on the Appalachian\nA perfect boys to talk about food so you are you say chili bond carried out from the Dixie ... red grief slick wax paper are my favorite [laughter] okay so now now now defend that so so these were really good if you do it or what\nOh heck yeah [laughter] and and let me let me explain a chili Brian is not a chili dog that's the first thing to understand there's no hot dog in it it is a very fine grained spicy\nChili mixture hamburger mix here that is packed into a hotdog bond with onion and with mustard and the texture it's extremely important that it's not like a sloppy Joe it's not kind of slurping around in the area it's in there being I'm\nFrom and the best way to think about this is this is this is a dish and it was ... my knowledge born in the pool halls and what you want to think about is if you're in that pool hall and you know the other guys running the table and you need something to eat you don't want something\nYour chili on your hands right\nYou don't want to get something hot\nRunning the table and you need something to eat you don't want something what Chile on your hands right yeah you don't want to get something hot and and that but a little bit of Greece won't hurt you know might make your slide a little better\nSo let's talk about some more food you know this really through the shacks sweet and savory banana pudding\nIt had powder jolt of the custard okay I can forgive you that what has red meat so red man of the anti breath now now wait a minute now that's that's a that's a milk street thing when you're from red meat so into a savory banana pudding what's going on\nMm\nThat was Ronnie

Logan giant greasy cut short or the names of Appalachian beans today things are named by marketing directors in Appalachia name so real stories about\nReal people that are will mostly and so lucky people\nEven get to go home\nRight now I'm heading into the kitchen a milk street to chat with editorial director James Hirsch about this week's recipes pesto general\nJ. Mario I'm doing great today it's pesto day it is and many of us and the food world and made it Eighteen different ways over time\nBut it never is anything like what you get in Italy and I always thought that was ... was better than ours but you went to Italy to figure this out the general and I guess it turns out it's not just the ingredients it's how you make it is it is and\nKnow one of the the most important lessons as always was that we do everything wrong [noise] first of all our ratios are greedy as for way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in pesto in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be\nShows and greedy ants are way off in general walk garlic is almost an afterthought in ... in the United states it tends to be very dominant flavor but it's really supposed to be more like salt and just heightened the other flavors we don't use nearly enough days old they tend to use it by the Bush will we tend to be much more minimalist with that\nAnd we use way too much olive oil they use much less and that's because they spend their pesto with pasta coconut water which of course produced a thicker more luxurious sauce we think we have to finish beforehand that doesn't work\nI also learned that we get the order wrong and the order in which you add the ingredients are either ... or ... or in our case into a food processor really matters because if you put the baseball for example into soon you're gonna over process that are over ... and that's gonna give you the wrong finished consistent\nSo your goal here is to get a pest that's pretty dry it's not the green sauce right it's dry\nExactly it's actually spread about whether it's before it's been married to pasta and we think of it\nAs a soft before it touches the pasta but it really is that loose then you've added to much olive oil and in general pessimism custard done until it's been added to pasta with some of the pasta coconut water then it's considered passer and then it's considered a complete but that's why I say we are way too much olive oil are we supposed to be dinner in his early or state so\nWhat's the order of the ingredients okay the order is very important again 'cause you don't want to over process the ingredients you start out with the garlic signed up through the salt and you're going to reduce that too and I find tasted it usually distributed through the ...\nThen we had our cheeses you want them finally ground add those in and again you add those to the pine up in the garlic and you make a nice smooth consistency with a little bit of granular already from the cheap\nNow the baseball goes it but when things we learned is that we couldn't just dumped the ... and like they do in Italy reason is they use smaller more tender base and they're able to just posted a few times and it's done our case most of the day is what we find at the grocery store tends to be kind of bigger and a little bit heartier\nAnd we had trouble getting it to the right consistency without over processing it and trying to get into our water ... but\nThe solution actually was pretty simple we just chop it up by hand on the cutting board and then added to the food processor give it a couple of pulses and we're done\nI Would assume anyone in general what we use the food processor exist as probably persona non grata so is this is good as what you had in general\nWell get lax the romance of bashing it with a mortar and pass though but I Would say we're Ninety five percent of right there we modified it enough with the word that we're getting really close and I got to say it is delicious\nSo Jim ... converted to this\nFive percent of re there we modified it enough with the war that we're getting really close and I got to say\nIt is delicious so Jim ... converted to the food processor Ninety five percent is good at least as the real thing thanks Jim Baker\nYou can get this recipe for pesto legitimacy when seven seven milk St\n\n... listening to milk street radio coming up more of your color and questions with my co hosts are both in we'll be right back [noise]\nSupport for Christopher Columbus milk street comes from regal where makers of Nineteen Nineteen cook Ware cooking happens in the kitchen but life happens around the kitchen table American Made stainless and non stick cookware learn more at Nineteen Nineteen cookware dot com\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners ... from the sponsors\nThe Ginny still play team at ... by the bay providing real estate services throughout Baldwin county including lifting selling investment property and relocation services more information at W.
