Desmond use the peanut butter controversy to change our food regulations and a lot of what the FDA does now and what it was\nNow and what it was doing back in the time of these peanut butter wars was trying to figure out how many peanuts should there be an peanut butter and should it be a hundred percent peanuts or if not then where should the line be drawn and and that quickly becomes an existential question even if you think it's a really simple question\nBefore we dive into peanut butter to check in with reporters sheeley visited the bus station Toby to get great Filipino food gene how are you\nI'm good how are you\nGood um what started in Tel Aviv on a Saturday afternoon Sabbath there is a very large bus station two and a half a million square feet there ... ... what started two story there\n[noise] okay so I'm Saturdays and Tel Aviv are pretty slow days most people including foreign workers have a day off today of rest public transportation shuts down a lot of the shops are closed people go to the beach\nAnd the bus station is pretty much shut down except for the fourth floor which transforms into sort of a little manila\nThere's a food market and it comes alive with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Filipino workers I stepped in line and started talking to some of the women there\nOn Saturday a man if he'd been assigning here you know the\nMeeting guy friends some day I think some of the heat that these that they are setting here\nSo women Filipino caregivers who have their day off basically they got off work they go home and they'll either start cooking friday night or early Saturday morning and they show up at the bus station\nAround noon they'll bring these huge plastic Tupperware it's filled with warm noodles and stir Fry's vegetable dishes little plastic containers full of desserts um and they set up these tables\nIn the hallway of the bus station there's also produce markets so they sell produce that normally you don't get in Israel so 'cause solve our route lemon grass\nDifferent bitter chords that you don't normally see and an Israeli grocery store and we'll all be like stuffed up in the bus station and they can not only to eat and to have this and all your foods\nBut they also come to hang out with friends and see relatives and people who they knew from the Philippines to see how their work is going to chat about working in Israel and life away from their families in the Philippines\nFor us that will be knows it's how people like happiness for\nThe give us relief you know from one week\nThe daycare on people\nSo ... how did you come across the story in the first place how did you find a force for the busters\nThree large eggs in one cup of that or not I didn't decrease the sugar a little bit I took the original cop and a quarter and a little bit less than a cop I talked to slavery was great but I also wonder how much to share\nThis is how much their hands what happens on a call in show like this everything's fine until about five minutes fall and tell me what happened why cooked it over my barbecue who really are actually out in the Senate fit enough\nWell you're right sugar is high gross carpet attracts moisture it has a huge effect on somebody like a custard pie\nBecause the chemistry so go back and use the original amounts and take it out when it goes in the center if that works then you know you solve that problem now the question is how much should be you can take out an especially with the cranberries I Would think that could be a problem you might have to add an extra egg that's very delicate chemistry\nAll right well I certainly try that says thank you so much for your incite yeah we'll see what happens\nNow ...

[noise]\n\nThis is mostly radio I'm Christopher Kimball at the center of modern federal food regulations as one of America's favorite foods peanut butter\nIn the Nineteen fifties many companies were doctoring their recipes with untested additives\nRoof does have been to Washington area homemaker decided to fight back and change the way food is regulated here in America reporter Krissy Clark produced a three part series on the peanut butter wars for marketplace and she's here today to tell us the story of the peanut butter grandma\nChrissy area I'm great thank you so this all starts the late fifties people are manufacturing peanut butter that's not all peanuts right\nYeah often in significant amount not peanuts ah at one point in the Nineteen fifties right after just came out these rumors started popping up that ah\nThere were in certain batches of Jeff at least only Seventy five percent peanuts and then other suspicious ingredients making up the difference\nSo is it the ... percenters is a problem or the quote unquote suspicious ingredients wait what if the rest of the ingredients were perfectly healthy wonderful things doesn't really matter\n[noise] well I think that is a big question that a lot of folks were debating at the time the the ingredient in question that I think raised a lot of alarm bells was a\nCritic go there was actually in the ... the factory formula [laughter] at the just plant it was up to twenty percent Crisco and peanut butter and for some consumers this was a shock um and some folks described it as it was a tantamount to\nIt was a a tantamount to having peanut flavored cold cream\nJobs are really doesn't ... doesn't sound like a great concept so the consumer reaction was fairly substantial 'cause you just tell us about ... how did it happen why does happen and and how upset were people yeah well it all kind of\nComes down to this um one woman named Ruth Desmond who had started an organization a few years earlier in the fifties called the federation of home bakers here's ... daughter Janet swap her\nShe said that's terrible they want to make money industry by putting less and less peanuts and the peanut butter and a ... children that are eating these peanut butter sandwiches mostly in here it's just peanut flavored cream\nRoof Desmond was a homemaker herself\nA very spirited very determined woman and so she got really interested in this issue she started reading up on a lot of the science just about food in general and food additives in general when her husband got sick with bladder cancer and she was trying to figure out what had happened and wanted to be feeding him healthy food\nThis was a time in American history where food was really transforming and it was after World War two and the two biggest industries coming out of World War two where the food industry and the chemical industry and they joined forces and so there was a lot of stuff that was showing up in our foods that\nEither people weren't aware that it was in there or if they didn't know they didn't know what it meant\nA and so one day when she was probably in the halls of the FDA she ran across this notice that mentioned that they were proposing a standardized definition for peanut butter\nAnd uh when she discovered that what prompted this was that some peanut butter companies big peanut butter companies had put\nLot of this hydrogenated vegetable oil into\nThe jar of peanut butter that she was by and she was shocked so she had a newsletter that she would circulate among homemakers and a flood of consumer comments started coming in to the FDA hundreds literally hundreds of letters here's Janet again\nHe said I Will tell everything I Will get all the facts and I will laugh to everybody because everyone needs to be an informed so she called herself on them\nAnd the ... and that's what she got and that's what was in our news letter you know telling people all the hearings and what was going on and the bills in Congress she put it in her newsletter and\nAnd that just gets cooked together for about thirty seconds till you can kind of smell so spices\nYou know I Love about this is that here in America vegetables and like games are kind of bland they weren't like the centerpiece all you have to do is looking to India for example and then you have the spices and all of a sudden this was as good as eating steak I mean it has a tremendous amount of flavor\nThat's right it's got a lot of flavor it's a great vegetarian dish we add a little bit of NATO at the end I\nAdd those yellow split keys to the dish so they're really thick and creamy you serve it over rice with a cucumber pickles and yogurt you can um as they do and vicious restaurant they add a fried egg on the top to make it kind of a more complete meal but really this is so flavorful and feeling that you you don't really need\nThe fight just going to go on everything about five years so you always will be courteous some and course

New York city apartment secondly I found that every batch of beans headed different roasting time and temperature\nAnd said very complicated to get a roast right 'cause otherwise someone to burn and some of them are green and he has this problem\nAnd then at the end of the day I discovered that when I make coffee it wasn't any better than actually was worse than beans\nI could just buy at the local louder may play for like a so I think the problem is you need a professional expensive roasting machine to get even roasting you have to get the timing just right\nTo get the roasting the flavor right you know the good thing about green beans is they hold you know they can keep them in the freezer or something for a long time\nI never had much luck these things are expensive and there's a huge amount of smoke given off so\nI really wanted to make this work but I just go to gave I finally well yeah I mean and also the quality of the green beans you're buying you know that's a different issue to laugh I think buying roasted not grounds beans and there's so many good suppliers out there right now but that's the easy way to go well\nLet's bring any kind of guy who likes to get involved in long projects\nUp on that kinda stuff [noise] I've only got a couple of pounds of these great though I think it's worth [laughter] go great opening to maybe do it just sort of like in a pan or something\nLike ... three or four hundred dollars and get a rose again after a while and we found is\nSecond hand you know a popcorn popper at thrift store it might be worth it\nI Do find now versus ten years ago my local place is like ten different kinds of beans and you can get really good teams and make great coffee and the other thing I find is I like lighter roast like medium roast getting the the roast just write with these things is also a little tricky tricky\nSo anyway there you go ... thank you so much okay Brandon thanks for calling calling already stricter\nThis is mostly radio I'm your host Christopher Kimball please give us a ring the number is eight five five four to six Ninety four three eight five five four to six nine eight for three or send us an email at questions and milk street\nRadio dot com welcome to the street who's calling\nHi this is how can we help you today okay so um I Lived in the kitchen love to cook\nI Love to be in the kitchen love to cook my one weakness I think is with desert\nThe one problem that I have with desert happened to deal with the frosting and the ice skating the decoration presentation all of that\nI Try a lot of recipes at home for my own crossing and I think but they never seem to work for the icing I Try that out or sugar with milk and vanilla thing it always comes out ... ... and then I tried to cream cheese one in the mix are also doesn't work\nWhat happens to the cream cheese when it never really become credible like I always even though I keep\nIt at room temperature I always feel like it clumps up and never has a great consistency and the taste is always just not there so how can I make really good frosting and I think that at home\nI agree with you that the pattern sugar ice skating pretty ... yeah I really ... you can add like orange juice to anything but I I don't orange that idea they never turn out now I don't like him a chocolate frosting always worst nicely because as the chocolate cools it sets up\nI like an Italian ... whispering which means you beat egg whites are and then you heat up sugar and get a sugar high sugar syrup\nLike at two thirty nine to forty the temperature doesn't actually matter that much\nAnd then you drizzle it on the egg whites as beating them in the mix her for about two or three minutes and that gets you a nice\nFluffy frosting middle hold nicely ... a day or so it's not that hard to do but you have another\nNo I was just going to say the boiled frosting which is sort of similar involved egg white friend I Would just sugar water egg whites ... but the thing about the Italian so you add the sugar served the egg whites there's also the Swiss where you heat up the sugar in egg whites and hooked up to about one sixty\nThose are a little tricky you want an easier recipe for frost thing I assume\nI mean that's what I Would prefer to start that way I can kind of build up my confidence and start working with something a little bit more advanced\nI think the cream cheese frosting though that's going to give you a good texture and that's going to hold really well to\nOkay and I wonder if maybe that's more a technique issue with me and not maybe really knowing how to work with my next or\nDo you have a hand mixer or stand mixer a stand mixer and what happened you said it was just the tests you was to stiffer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Milk Street Radio", "city": "Selma", "day": "13"}
