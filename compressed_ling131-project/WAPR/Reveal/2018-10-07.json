but because he's in jail for so long\n... what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses a lot to hammer them\nTo date Bernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana

out [noise]\nFor telling a story about two minutes\nPrince Albert is in jail and Leon Kennedy era is the district attorney who put them to be a Kennedy arrow use Louisiana's three strikes law the vigil offender statutes Alaska Prince Albert for a really long sentence and reporter ... has been hearing a lot that it's not just Prince Albert it's thousands of people\nBelieved what is the d._a. has to say about that well\nThe d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom that first person used to work for ... as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you were in da a\nRegular here's a seven years and years of feels like an attorney Thompson\nStern Thompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nWhen I was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard that was\nEven lower her office for lack of a better way of describing a that was the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that visual offender statue it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like do you tend to zero never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere is as mines that are the more before we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we want to stop the crime problem punished fine as long as ... you know harsh sentences or the turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the ritual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your ... started every way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge is even the considerations with the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge or leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nWas this little light black or right this is a life like there's a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of\nThis law takes away poses a problem with the functions of a judge which is to\nFashion the census is a pool is just simply for that particular person\nWhen district attorney's use the habitual offender statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has no choice\nTwice as I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I Want that treatment is the composer before ... was a vigil ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year or someone just to go away and [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da\nNa ... just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black their da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nOur lives in ... oh you did you ever been to those ... are we going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is arrows private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da ... you\nKnow for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything is public safety can you sort of started with no charm a Jew or does public safety really demand ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have ... I never heard back\nIn an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana\nWhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nBe remiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor case and simply said I'm not going to prosecutors because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call that's what you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nIf it is the law I think I have a responsibility to prosecutors if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nFor Kennedy ... line is I'm just doing my job why does he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is kind of journalists than\nI Am what I\nCall a criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a Jew Jew a big you would\nDo a ... a ... you know this is monitored them among war room [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stacked by his computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody was doing this but when Harry can it can do is\nWe'll ... we'll wait wait wait wait wait a minute here did did he just said Harry comic the jazz singer no that's a junior [noise]\nThis was his dad Harry Connick senior\nWhen Harry counting came into office he\nWe use the multiple below two shows\nUp in this shows is that that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of the day that\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney had already comic budgets to use the powers of hers offer to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhibited crimes against decency this\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime was surging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that ... so he brought this law back from when ... when does it start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any first shot a third ... be convicted of any right to be sure I'd be considered as armed forces I envy him isn't that a labor for live\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nIs a client has for example of civil battery charge which is an estimator\nBut there was some kind of object he used an out we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here it might go across the street and aggravated battery so they'd be looking at twenty to live on it persisted there to fix my you're saying that they would change the charge\nSo that they could then him for the multiple bell correct exactly and there's no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal ... negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know can is there a use the law in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] of course Kennedy era refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official but he did offer a statement about princes case\nHere a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received a legal sense under the Louisiana law if he believed himself not guilty he could've exercise has constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy said\nMy hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself and eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison\n\nAfter I requested to interview prince he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat his addiction our connection was in great\n[noise] when did you do the first one [noise]\nTo limit so that was like six years and years\n[noise]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nIt's been seven years you've got three to go has anything changed for you\nLove so much lower though mortgages being away from those of you can move retrieved or were you all the ... and ...\n... ... ... ... ...\nA few times now princes asked me to give a message to his oldest son prince junior these calls are expensive and his son can't always afford them anyway prince asks me to tell us on he misses him and then he says telling my love them and I do [noise]\n\nHe's a rooms in the world for that story her podcast is called on President\nNext in Philadelphia a brand new Jersey
