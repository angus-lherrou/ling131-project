happening\nIt almost give people the the mindset that business is a privilege not a right and so now anything that has a privilege has to get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you

house brands he's voting as a write in their privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate a bit a matter of how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss on all that but if you don't know on October the first so there's a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and in fact two presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's a fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camped wins it the racial breakdown of voters days about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nAnd you have to

machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not highly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia\nA lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hack in Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of election they're actually listen reveals by a donkey picks up the story [noise]\nYeah so uh right now I'm In the machine in\nLogan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks\nLike on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta\nHis specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch ... glitter and then it's deacon pressing the image is the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as my ring came\nTo this is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nLimited truly only by one to imagination to commit fraud on a paper ballot\nShe also said that even the Logan findings were troubling they're different from a problem with the voting machines themselves\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different secured systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly\nMac Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan\nHe studied the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you're injecting permission or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the street the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta you was grueling took all day\nYou at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic wind for the midterm election\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state pays in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as\nWe're concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious former abilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of fat\nPacking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards the midterms would have ... systems and machines but very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nTo people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty teens\nAnd it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg is ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter]\nUh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by Duncan brought us

public radio [noise]\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is reveal a mallet today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that if there was like just say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people\nThose claims have been totally ... but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically are pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe seals use worst nightmare 'cause he knows the constitution as far as they keep them from making trouble for any of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey ... hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has this big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people in question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who\nIt was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud\nKobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging elections that way we know that that is not true that is right now I could through a bunch of the little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a made a problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed her book lists them or what was the looking person well you know come what makes a really good politicians he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate\nBut as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you just\nSaid it would be ... or you're\nThe term line is inaccurate it's not off line then you will thrill all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach you know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument and I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford\nAnd then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agree to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U.S\nOkay so how does this thing work so about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registrations and most often this happens when people move\n... rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida [laughter] no I did not that's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not
