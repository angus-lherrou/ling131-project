find out later that testing is no longer free women now have to pay one hundred dollars and the other thing is last year the government said the crisis was over so why would a woman even ask for the test\n\nAnd then I asked or something else when we'll all that data on developmental delays in ... babies be released\nI think ah there will be some information released\nThis is the kind of answer I

posts so what's going on here why are so many landlords unwilling to take out or is in Texas\nBut I don't know the utilization of section eight is a discriminatory to at all\nThis is Stacey hunt he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they noticed section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed stay behind earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits have alleging discrimination against voucher holders when you say to that\nAnd disagree with that I think the the the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live where their support group for their family is where transportation where the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe book it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\nFrom fuel for this lady or within ... coal to people in this ...\nNest quest we'd heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad you sent officials

then up time move out we are willing to fit the bill for any damages\nWhen Isabelle took this job not quest had a one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no today and the first time we actually had his heart talking to landlords it was honestly it was really discouraging does\nThe fact that under less quest that landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the program does that suggest that there's that there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it's\nStill that hesitation that I don't want to work with someone who's on section eight\nAs
