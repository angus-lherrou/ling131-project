now this is your debut novel this is how you break into the literary world with this\nUh imaginative retailing of the founding and starting of the country of Liberia\nOr what's the magic realism mixed in with the history are focusing on three main characters as we've said all of whom have special powers as we said gifts or this is a beautiful book um [noise] it's um teachers teachers use some history while you're enjoying the ride and that's always going to open the book and wild to more [noise]\nJust happy to be here\nSo glad to have you thank you as we mentioned as you said you've spent your little toddler probably when you were living in Memphis is you're moving around the country so\nYeah yeah so my family moved to America from Liberia when I was five years old in Nineteen Ninety and we moved down quite a bit from uh New York to Connecticut to Memphis and then we settled in Texas I'm a southern girl was raised in spring Texas\nWell and then moved back to New York when I was Seventeen at school so you're up in Brooklyn Oh yes I Am I'm In Brooklyn\nAnd so you knew you left Liberia is a little little child five years old yeah to to work on this book you went back in the interview you're Ninety two year old grandmother\nYeah yeah she is a really wonderful storyteller she my my first novels I Would say she's the one who told me what stories what the infrastructure and\nAn architecture story look like and so I was so grateful for her and talked to her about what Liberia was like and what she heard Liberia was like from her grandparents and it was wonderful conversation\nNow these three characters we mentioned there's so many ways you could have gone about it on the history of a barrier but you sort of shows as we say the magic realism each character ah one of them like for instance can disappear with\nYeah so like the best in its history and it's the history of very complex and it's because of the identities that comprise the republic so you have indigenous groups that have been in the region before the name\nThe history is very complex and it's because\nOf the identities that comprise the republic so you have indigenous groups that have been in the region before the name Liberia was given then you have free blacks and former slaves from America who went back in the mid nineteenth century and free blacks and former slaves from the Caribbean who also went back\nAnd they formed what is now Liberia and this was happening in the mid nineteenth century or colonialism and imperialism was still going on on the continent slavery was still going on in other parts of the continent so I Want it to definitely explore that history and mix it with\nMy favorite genre which is magical realism\nYes and I'm sort of there is what I'm I'm not going to say it's a myth was common ... has been the again these were repatriated African Americans who have chosen to go back to to Africa and found this country yeah\nAnd they're already natives they're in\nThe African American show up as you mentioned they probably have a little more money coming in from the settlement or whatever so there's gotta be natural resentment\nThere the tension that existed but there were comb marriages and the and the group's co existence as they were trying to build this republic\nAnd so I definitely want it to tell that story I think during the time the nineteenth century even when I moved here and I was going to school in Texas\nI heard very little of Liberian history and how closely linked it is to American history at these people decided hey you know what I I Want to go back to the continent and being able to go there and successfully build a republic it's something I definitely want to explore and fiction\nAnd we certainly did you actually in New York growing up Liberia and reading it and there's Mississippi in Africa there's a colony there\nYeah yeah all of her and wrote the book about yeah Mississippians who went back\nYeah my my paternal side they're actually from South Carolina they went back to Liberia and Eighteen Seventy one from Rock Hill South Carolina and so this summer I had a chance to go visit South Carolina visit Rock Hill and\nMeet some of the descendants of my family who chose to stay rather than going back to Liberia and so that was a fascinating experience that is interesting\nYeah ah you know the novel is called she would be getting ... to more of the things you know\n[noise] so much for\nBeing a lot to me so this is October eleventh so it's the one month anniversary of my novels debut and uh as he mentioned before it mixes history with magical realism magical realism isn't John or that I ...\nThree of my novels debut and as he mentioned before it mixes history with magical realism magical realism isn't genre that I Love\nBut it was really my introduction to the story telling it was very rare and the west African storytelling tradition and specifically the by storytelling tradition and other black diaspora story tell us that I Would hear the story that didn't include someone who was flying or shape shifting are disappearing\nAnd so when my family moved here when I was five there's a thing called ... [laughter]\nAnd all of a story that included fantasy were relegated to Disney and I didn't really understand that and so when I started writing I knew that I wanted to write in this genre\nOur mayor men over power less but died with race this\nJune to Iran thank you [noise]\n\n\nLike you so much she would be getting a walk through will join us after the show's uncover uses it was dogs are more thanks so much [noise] you know also want to\nMention that I'm a she is also the founder of a nonprofit organization one more book more spilled like her last name or a nonprofit organization that helps a reading for children in countries underserved in with a low literacy rate of the group publishes books as well as bill bookstores one\nOpen in two thousand Fifteen in Liberia [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nRight um [noise] you get them written and then you put them in the hands of kids what a great thing thank you so much for your time\nAlready a as we mentioned of one of the characters are Norman era gone in a while\nBook starts off in Jamaica so we thought we would um\nThe characters are Norman era gun in a while\nTo his book starts up in Jamaica so we thought we would have some Jamaican influence music now Norman though it does a cool thing as you mentioned he stowed away on a ship a passenger ships from Jamaica to Africa so two month trip he's invisible\nSo he is and you have it in the book he's going through the diner car hey you're not going to the bar you plunk\nScotch looks good playing [laughter] that's good stuff to Muncie invisible\nJust think about it for a minute [noise] you don't go there because you got class I Would go\nI Would go there and made it\nAll right it's a great uh Allen teams we mentioned what a beautiful evening no humidity and we've got one of the coolest guys in town is ... and the pan Caribbean delegate [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] Mm [noise]\nMm\n\nShare share share not often check your body\nWhat can I\nSaying is\nApply to the last time\n[noise] ...\nThat\nNot on the\n\n[noise] you just\nKnew that you would you\n\n\n\n\nI like to introduce the members of the group on Congress we have Johnny then as soon as a general education major [noise]\nShe's a junior\nOn drums set novel obeys before is ...
