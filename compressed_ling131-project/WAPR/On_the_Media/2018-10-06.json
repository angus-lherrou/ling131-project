was shot and he said a few things I should not have to say no to that he regretted them words not the anger and his display of outrage and we weren't for no\nNo they were the whole ball game until

can get the consequences for hurting women me too movement strides to apply when we spoke with slate staff writer lily Luther\nLast November she explained in front of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse me nor bad behavior we called on her again to identify the fantasy she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nTo anti bandwagon fallacy\nAnd let's see if something I kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerge we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were\nFaces in my life especially against\nSo the question is if there was something ... going on what their hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that to be a bandwagon [laughter] that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently is that ... effect or technique which is a way that a lot of people who are accused respond\n... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of a notion we saw his Rogers and big move your show by his peers are induced fury not a doctor for rubber on this on for confirmation process which frankly has a bird\nAnd I saw in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number of pundits describing both his testimony and hers as equally credible\nWhich I found astonishing\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision\nHe basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can't cheat or steal or drink\nIf we do all these things well then we will be reunited with our loved ones and our ancestors and the after world give us almost Protestant and it's and it's insistence on a kind of work ethic as it's spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers in the right way and for the right shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meaning the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes down it was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased\nGo there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted outspent sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with hodgkiss cannons on largely an armed men women and children [noise]\nThe descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer he said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and white these on paying ... and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the ... car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book you'll understand why\nStand by I I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place that was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off the following treated real purchase a health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies just as we got down there the whole the whole\nWe got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the ... the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of that sixty six thousand dollars or not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join a caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come\n[noise] come violence [noise] might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge\nAnd in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd sell for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three women need me was under siege\n[noise]\n\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against this stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military buildup everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom we are not native hostage\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so [noise] in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much\nThank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid Dreier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of literature the University of Southern California a novelist and author of the forthcoming book the heart of wounded knee Native

[noise]\nYou're listening to Alabama public radio mature and check us out online you can find this at a public radio on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram that's at A L public radio at our website is available at a PR dot org\n\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone indigenous people stay on Monday we'll pay homage to all those his ancestors and homelands were trampled with colonial disregard\nThe question of who should claims solidarity with this minority seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racist far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery in an alternative for Germany mean biking to pass and fortunately I found\nIt hilarious at first it was in a tweet ... one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany\nTheir tweed showed the photograph of who didn't believe it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations and that\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six and that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party mhm Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a terrible for this phenomenon Indian food the ...\nAnd you say that India and the thing is he adds them and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation miss\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources do cry these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decadent and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nEntered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland which throughout the\nThroughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shot her hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache teeth and then to see him to be little really popular actor among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter]\nShe's always out there by himself looking for white people he can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has his character trait that their German ... was the worst supposed to strive towards like honesty bravery industry is in is\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nYet it is that the ... late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand we knew two novels to the troops\nBecause he said reading about miniature will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that venue to what the ideal company commander buddy wasn't why\n[laughter] [noise] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nDoes however Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not harness it and profit from it\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said presenting Indian novel to German children teaches them about leadership\nAnd military training and racial ideology how to teach about race ideology [noise]\nYeah they take wrote about ... and he like and to come so not only to the famous Germanic leader army news who defeated the Roman legions at the battle of ... book forest in nine a D\nYou also like him to come to Adolf Hitler saying all three United people who were ... among themselves\nAnd make the people's strong in the face of danger he also said to come to last because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the
