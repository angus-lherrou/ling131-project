your Native American heritage music knowledge that you listed yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself or in those directory so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born up until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are like family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced\nShe set because they're cheekbones were Hi was it in ... that she was Native American\nIn July he escalated\nI won't give me a million dollars for your favorite charity paid

genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence congested as we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she came out and thought she scored at first and showed the media and it's sort of the men exotic Trump pay off the million dollar bet\nAnd then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nPay off the million dollar bet at all of a sudden algae is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that her use of the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and the last appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bottom sides\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere is a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nCan tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is\nI don't mean to sound cliche but everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and said\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific\nYou can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk plays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors the ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be heads household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their ... these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how traveling romances govern and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and a rabbit hole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nFrom somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father is non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eighth total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to one day\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... percent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonize we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women then this is something much she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his\nTaunt you know\nThink he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a sheriff\nTo those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nWhy do you think they do it\nAnd the housing market between forms of African ethnicity or whether or not someone is deemed to be just black or white and what those racial identities experience as they are entitled people to or don't entitle people too in the world\nAlondra thank you very much to pleasure to speak with uber\nAlondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of DNA race reparations and reconciliation after the teen [noise]\n\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twin disease on [noise] on the\nMedia is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart\nAvailable on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nNewer Saudi tries to take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was President Trump is the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nFor her the N word definitely worse because they were former soldiers hired to the military operations combat targeted killings for the military over foreign powers Saturday on weekend edition from NPR News [noise]\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners ... from the sponsors\nSupport for Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors the Alabama Shakespeare festival in Montgomery, Alabama announcing its new festivals season under the artistic leadership of Rick build on touch Mitt and Greta Lambert subscription information available at A.

Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale\nAccording to Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal these study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nI I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of these adopted parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and either\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years to go\nWith hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart just how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space while it's swimming lived

to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins who difference and white\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as he got the twins were born and somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact\nAnd one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Selma", "day": "20"}
