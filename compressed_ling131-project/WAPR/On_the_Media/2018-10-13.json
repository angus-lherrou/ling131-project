here on Alabama public radio thanks for joining us here on this Saturday morning\nI'm your host outlook selfish on coming up next we get three four hours of weekend edition all the way starting up at seven and then it's been a minute coming up at and after that the NPR News quiz wait wait don't tell me at eleven but anymore you're on your listener supported NPR\n[noise] this is on the media on Bob Garfield yes as red ... says there's money thing is an endless perplexed or maybe as Matthew McConaughey maintains in the wolf of Wall Street is merely an illusion\nAnd these are guys who was if it was used as fairy dust doesn't exist it's never landed it is no matter it's not on the elemental chart did not read all\nThe very first things that we see that we could call money like really are sets of transactional records that emerge in the ancient Near East in Mesopotamia\nBill ... is a cultural anthropologist and socio legal scholar at the University of California Irvine\nOf a sudden we have this kind of new thing people a lot\nThing people a lot of people living in a place altogether\nNeeding some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community\nWith a population size it's getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore and we start to see centralized systems to help people keep track of what they owe to whom wait what he's\nDescribing ledgers a system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money was simply an advancement on the earlier barter system chicken for grain for X. blades and so on everybody knows that\nIn primitive day's living with simple and each family produced whatever is needed the first kind of business was offered a good stone cutter for instance might make a few extra tools and simply praise them for ... and other things he was it was easy there was no need for money\nMore from that delicious Nineteen forty seven educational film we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized for us to do business five ... that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now or no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere\nIn history yeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money\nYou know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be and in the nineteenth century as economics is becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the ... people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally add to do with some\nTo do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case\nIsn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this border mythology become so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and start sort of peeling back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told in Mesopotamia tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of book keeping\nWe're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering but are growing grain\nAnd are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles I plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread\nAnd sheep and goats only Cav during certain parts of the year you know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in season ... of those plants and animals to deal with and what we start to see in this\nWe start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples observe spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look you're giving me this go today thank you after a certain period of time after six months I Will\nRepay that debt that I now [noise] with certain number of bushels of [noise] okay that is from the fertile crescent three millennia go it's from a different tack to Chicago Board\nOf trade soybean trading floor from two thousand and six [noise]\nBut you get the idea and in both cases every promise was recorded\nWe had scribes in these temples keep track of these contracts and that's where we start to see something like money\nThat's kind of a time deferred contract for the settlement of a debt recorded on that clay I'd like to joke that you know in the beginning was not the coin in the beginning was the receipt and that's essentially what you've got in those clay tablets\nAnd other slightly less portable media\nTravel as the New York times retro reported to the tiny must British an island of yeah\nHome to the money the size of semi truck we'll made of stone [noise]\nThere are thousands of these stones all over the place [noise]\nThey're actually an ancient form of currency who's value resides partly\nIn scarcity stones had to be imported in canoes from neighboring islands partly in the effort invested to quarry and build them but mainly in the communal memory of who owns them and the consensus of their worth MIT nay hung the ruler from her Ted Talk\nNow they don't actually movies\nRice turns around her exchange them by students can get to be pretty massive the largest it's about four times and twelve feet across\nYou can't feed the meter with them or melt them down or wire them abroad you can only remember with them\nSo they just kinda keep track of who owns what part of what stone\nKindly hold that thought to now in time the recording of obligations did give way to the shorthand of coin and currency and further to banking transactions and credit instruments and so on to the cost as we shall soon discuss of digital currency\nCurrency dusted money emerge not from the barter system but from the need to keep track of an unwieldy number of transactions suddenly it seems so hobbyists [noise]\nMoney is demonic defines a proxy for history a memory stick [noise]\nOr not remember this was an endless perplexed we're talking about and if money is merely a record of obligations why does its value fluctuate sometimes even jai rate based on factors that have zero to do with who knows what to whom\nWe all understand that inflation steadily erodes the face value of a dollar a car that costs seven thousand dollars in Nineteen Seventy cost thirty thousand dollars today and all that but what else is at play in determining the value of a dollar\n... [noise] they asked me\nNamed\nFirst late there are two kinds of money base money meaning all the world's currencies in circulation and the cash reserves and the global banking system and credit money which is all the money promised to be paid eventually\nAnd you've been listening to own the media here on Alabama public radio thanks for joining us here on this Saturday morning I'm your host outlook
