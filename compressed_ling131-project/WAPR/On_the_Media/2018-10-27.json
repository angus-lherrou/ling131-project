rebuilding [noise] it was chaotic but once the bomb squads wrapped up everybody defaulted to their inevitable roles Donald Trump after first offering boilerplate condemnation of political violence immediately retreated to blaming the biggest culprits\nWhat is the first statement the president makes about this today is to attack the media you know he says a very big part of the anger we see today and our society is caused by the purpose and they fall in inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news\nHas gotten so bad and hateful than beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fat\nWhich blame shifting rhetoric led to charges that the president himself incited violence with his constant vilification of Democrats in the press\nSo if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato knock that crap out of avoid you\nKnow last few days he's been calling for hatred toward exactly the growth and individuals that were just targeting CNN's Chris Cuomo well coming out and says we need to be all\nThere is no apology needed to say it doesn't rain quite true\nIn short order the speculation an accusation were reduced to right versus left\nNotably and an explanation that surprised absolutely no one the conspiracy crowd from Rush Limbaugh too and culture to gateway punted to Lou Dobbs blamed Democrats for a false flag operation supposedly aimed at discredited in the right in advance of the mid term elections\nI Will repeat it's a high probability that the whole thing is set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats number one and number two to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border yes that is what I'm saying\nThat was Michael Savage this from Fox News\nElectorate more enthusiastic by guest baiting them on that issue and Democrats we now have gotten much more liberal on immigration so I guess the short answer is we just don't know how the electorate is reacting to those things\nSo I guess one final question does any of this matter are there are still many mine's not made up and of those mine's not made up or they're going to go to the polls in the first place\nMatter or there's still many mine's not made up and of those mine's not made up or they're going to go to the polls in the first place do we have any idea of what would

morning\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield for the past two weeks little was\nKnown about the enormous human caravan wending its way toward the U.S Mexico border\n[noise] except that it was a political bonanza for the Republican Party and remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about Donald Trump characterized the exodus as a\nWord of would be illegal immigrants about the surge over unprotected borders to take our jobs flood or community of gang activity and drugs and as a bonus harbor Middle Eastern terrorists\nAnd is now obviously trying to conflate both Middle Eastern fair and illegal immigration and sort of a double racist sandwich\nWe're going to the evening of Americans in the hands of Mexico Geraldo no never\nThat as opposed to the truth thousands of desperate people many of them women and children in fear of their lives\nTaking advantage of safety in numbers and no need to pay parasitic coyote traffickers yet destined to wait in line for weeks or months to apply for legal political asylum\nSarah ... a freelance reporter traveling with the caravan has written for the Daily Beast about the cruel reality behind the surge of migrants not an invasion or a stun to beat Donald Trump but the desperate reaction to ongoing crisis in Honduras\nSarah welcome to in the media thank you for having\nNot until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nGigantic population of truckers which so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with the guy named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think at that time I started in ...\nAccording to have our tell and I'm not going to go skiing finding that there are other people with ... care that he saw information about it on faith and if they can get in touch with Oregon there\nYou have to live on an experience I think that like ... and a show on and so he got in touch with them their fight it and then he said the posts on these according\n... immigration um and so he got in touch with them verified it and then he shared the post on Facebook according to tell her what happened was there isn't any two hundred three hundred people and then there's this news report on hunters as most watch cable news network called H. C.\nSuing coming on dog sees when I got to be identified\nHim as a leader that my body on a Wednesday and then when I look in and they are definitely said that he would be paying for food and other costs are people\nThat are ...\nYou know the gospel I guess every I and I want but I don't know how to do that\nAnd he said he got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them going but then all of the other factors for white people migrate contribute to why it had to help out in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news report with the initial explosion\nOn the report from H. C. H. here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in Honduras the government wants to minimize why people are leaving they know\nThey're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that they that is the government created\nThis is in line with what the United States is saying that there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me it's actually video of turban members\nBeing paid cash money\nHas the story is told that it's you know George Soros\nMoney or Democratic Party money ... people had northward to invade our boys\nWant caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise] but that has been debunked has it not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checks on it first day on a busy owned by the New York times they had there's absolutely nothing to back up that George Soros is paying any on on the care that\nI Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed to that and that's really not unusual considering the local\nSteve that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed out to them and that's really not unusual considering the local\nSupport that we're seeing her migrants here in Mexico both in the town once people get there and then along the way there's people passing out water banana it's close enough for\nMe though yesterday and then how are the migrant settled people came out and we're giving us toys underwear and all these sorts of different necessities\nThey're releasing a groundswell of local support for this care of them\nKnow what's interesting about that Trump is that its origins seemed to be the hundred and ... to the United states\nWho sent the video footage to a Republican congressman who immediately tweeted out in their ... caught fire so this is not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the charge eight affairs the closest thing to the ambassador to the United states has around hunter is is that this is funded by the opposition of hunter and that is sort of a political game that people\nWithin the country are playing that sort of more than a line that I've been seeing raised in Honduras which makes sense the country is extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year where there was a razor thin election and the machines counting the votes shut down and when they came back on\nThe lead of the opponent slowly starting to slip away and the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez who had been the incumbent one power and so critics allege the he stole the election and it sort of through the country into unrest thirty people died in that shuffle mostly killed by security forces\nTo the country is kind of grown in polarization sense so you know this sort of seems that narrative a with a president that's frankly facing acquitted legitimacy crisis\nNor do you have to go let me ask you one last question is there one story that you've encountered these kind of crystal ours is the situation the the personal drama or the politics and the fear\nThe politics and the fear\nI mean it had in every person that story and it really it just makes it kind of all I can yeah they date at the top of that\nHomeopathic politics battling attack ads with doses of the ads themselves [noise]\nOn the media is supporting my progressive insurance with a name their price to providing information on a range of insurance coverage in price option more progressive dot com or one eight hundred for

Catherine wherever upon caster found\n\nThe investigation continues into the suspicious packages gender critics from President Trump will have the latest ulcer Russian trolls try to influence American by reading about what ball players kneel during the anthem\nWhat their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord so if you're attempting to divide people this is a pretty great subject and Saturday on weekend edition from NPR News I'm\nAndrew tuned in to own the media here on Alabama public radio thanks for joining us here on this Saturday morning\nComing up next we got three ... hours of

online or any one of our three each the audio streams or catch up on some of the latest news from around the state in the region\nThat is available at H. P. R. dot org\nNow back to on the media you're on a PR\nNews from around the state and around the region that is available at H. P. R. dot org now backed up on the media you're on a PR\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield\nOn election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhen did not seem to be mean\nAnd woman can enter a woman cannot\nDown privacy and the man [noise]\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if\nThey're approached in such a way from\nFriendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other [noise]\nInitiated the perspective having what's the effect the person becomes suddenly more open to other out groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling\nWhat we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had a conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not that treatment group is significantly\nMore accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads it'd be affected the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy on the matter of campaign theory\nActually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter at this particular kind of intervention\nImpacts of this kind of campaign activity I don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter is much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers who have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies hold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom\nOf political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns the Bernie Sanders' campaign and twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap you might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nWouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of a trap that the research on campaigns and elections and campaigns consult me has been for a hundred years what we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else\nOf course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures\n[laughter] well I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate other activities around it within the next year hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence base that he's very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates or will be interested in applying in their work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Selma", "day": "27"}
