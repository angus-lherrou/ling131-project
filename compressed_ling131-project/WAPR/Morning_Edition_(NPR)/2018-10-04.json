since President Trump nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh out to the Supreme Court back in July advocacy groups have spent a whole lot of money nearly ten million dollars on these warring TV ads for and against them now the attacks and this and the spending our fiercer than ever Here's NPR's Peter Overby\nTheir sharpest attacks so far may come from the American civil liberties union which opposes Kavanaugh the ACLU rode out the ads this week with a million dollar by and former state law does not\nSexual relations with a woman\nI've never seen anything like this\nI categorically unequivocally

[noise]\nVoice advice and consent searches destroy\nThought back clearing his name at the hearing Kavanaugh described the allegation against him this way\nThis whole effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flying every which way and the Kavanaugh confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups that can keep their donors secret the thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ads\nThe centers Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd a little over four million dollars that's been spent running ads and ingest those states\nThere's two million dollars more being spent in Maine home of undecided Republican Senator Susan Collins and about half a million in Alaska home of another uncommitted Republican Lisa Murkowski Keith said these are not high cost media markets\nEspecially when you're looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska\nLike North Dakota and Alaska um this is really an incredible amount of spending\nThe Brennan Center data show that when

a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings\nAnd it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS will Steve a rocket seems to be coming\nBack to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for you know the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now\nSome electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open is kinda bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely yeah a lot more fun\nTire early yeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states that controls that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nWriting that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort

morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh right amid remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it\nWell the answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations\nAre and the second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that\nA cabinet exposed himself to her at a party when they're both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off to do so\nOr Democrats have also increasingly talked about Kevin I was drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legend incidents but the key thing to remember here is that uh the White House is the

didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um

and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nThere are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that\nThat part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nWriting that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet\nAnd here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for a living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nThis is Alabama public radio in the

ago this week uh epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or abnormally small heads among other impairments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called seek a love story among the people he met words you're ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou are still emotional about their ... to get him the hottest ... gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing\nTyping with what happened [noise] but they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they are very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mean I was you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children on may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are things that chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand and there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children who can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achievements that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually ...\nThe disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around it's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins a girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this for a job that will go Melissa Victoria she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another that the it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so what their lives are gonna be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access a school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what are they going to do about child care and and\nSo we're able to join um the actress ... she went around ... some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving them pep talks interest sort of saying you know you need to write to the man you need to write to the health extreme telling to give you a bus to take your child to school you know that's kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because he has his personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his chats how did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much with my little girl a year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little girl and\nHer mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing an Eighteen month Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's got to worry she'll come you know but you caught\nCause you know you just don't know where every child different ah I just felt like they were very like kind of just as almost you know [noise]\nThe pieces called Zeke I Love stories it's on the BBC website\nAnd it was written by William Kramer William thank you so much for talking with [noise] thank you love [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis is NPR News\nMost Republican voters support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite sexual assault allegations against him that could make it difficult for red state Democrats up for reelection like West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin\nGovern the past it was a great supporter to such people to people and the cultural exchanges so why should we cut off all these ties or the natural ties between that's what people\nWould you encourage greater openness going the other way if Americans scholars who may have controversial opinions want to visit China if American journalists want to go to sensitive areas like Tibet would you encourage greater openness on China's part\nYou see well open to American students professors journalists scholars of cause uh\nFor some of the cases that Tibet because it is very high or ought to do it and the uh the comments could be a tough that\nVery high altitude yeah I think American journalist and scholars can handle the altitude I mean we have file to do it in the United states\nWell not everybody could quickly get used to such comment unnatural conditions even for Chinese men over them would not feel very well ...\nWhat about weaker areas and far northwest China\nWell at this is part of China so the whole country is open to the rest of the wood such an is this part is also open but honest elite\nIn this part of China with a particular problem that is terrorism very violent extremist groups I'm sure some people on that\nPeople oh there's some attempt to create a situation locks the ISIS in that part of China\nWhat have you thought about is the United nations has said that hundreds of thousands of people and weaker areas have been put into camps\nYou see very often widespread star as may not be the true story I think whatever we're doing in that part of China is for the wellbeing and safety and security of the people who are you putting\nPeople in camps to do that\nIt's not you see first of all we have to take measures to make sure that\nGroups a lot like ISIS will not be spreading into positron ... second delay will have to make sure that people have means to build a better life for them to learn more skills they have to have them techniques\nTo develop themselves and also we have to maintain loco stability people will\nBe listening carefully to your words um\nThey may hear you
