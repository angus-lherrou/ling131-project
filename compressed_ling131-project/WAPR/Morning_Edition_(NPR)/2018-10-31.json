that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his defense of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person who gets paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio here the smartest\nLast in general again a biased Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest me you know what are they talking about they talk about\nThe lead you ever see the elite\nAnd not\nYou are the only [noise] her says when\nPeople are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the ... in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual anti Semite school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms and what they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat in anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the

L. dot edu\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my aunts my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics\nOr we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape short it was after\nThe twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about this\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I'd been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side I\nThink they have I I think they're equal\nAnywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my

raised their hands and that was it\nThe floodgates open and they were all presenting air you know what emotions they were going through and I think they had a hard time processing but I told them that's okay because adults are having a hard time processing\nOne of her eighth grade students that she was concerned about the attack on the synagogue would soon be forgotten\nBecause mass shootings have become a regular part of life\nAnd I didn't know what to say to her sometimes a teacher\nDoesn't know what to say but then I came back with you are the voices and you can make change or not to young\nGoldblum says her job is to help her students understand religious identity and cycles of persecution\nHer students have a sense for justice they've been active and marches for refugee and immigrant rights\nShe says they're now connecting those movements to their own Jewish history\nThey have felt very strongly about this because they know from studying the Holocaust how the doors were shut down on\nAvi Baron Monroe is the head of the school she says well older students process their grief through learning and reflecting about anti Semitism some younger students were scared\nA lot of them were like I go there or my family goes right who's there last week and one child asked about um when I go back and my going to have to see the bullet holes in the stores\nBuried Munro says she

only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's their job to make the world a better place\nIn the Bruce to put on them which is basically repair of the world so from a very

and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast exploring\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so\nChina has never created something quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is for lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is in that tank and I'll make activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust\nShe says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back so in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them\nAnd you know who has lots of data on how people behave companies especially big companies like Ali Baba that as China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country\nAnd has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit\nSo the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not somebody when they miss a bill it could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public they gave the press was you know if you buy not peas your responsible so your school go out but if you buying video games you lazy CEO school go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data of its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to\nThe social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty but we got

sure but now after um the changes have happened the cars and they will wait for you\nKnow remember she John is an example if somebody with a perfect score if you're a social credit score is low or if

last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to first and only go so I don't get paid by so rose or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Jeffrey ...\nIt seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me [noise] you know when they talk about they don't get mad at the elite you ever see the elite and not\nYou are the elite [noise] half says when\nPeople are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether in Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentment and hatred that there's anything in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy than he is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon

about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nAnd people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords used to ... short term leases but Steve Short with commercial real estate service jails says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect the model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercials spaces CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich is you know so the push coming from ... to regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of celebrities in like fingers and performers function their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set a pop up centered around a specific artist awash says as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease\nArtist oh watched as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is then you're ... by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the puppet render turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution and build up right now the short term is than your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases friend PR News I'm Suzie on in

one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota\nAt a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the U.S\nBecause I think so too\nI I I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you did you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics [laughter]\nI was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity how did that take shape\nWe're pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape\nShort it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working in immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings with Brett Kavanaugh really closely I did how did those\nHow did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's\nIt's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I Believe doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I\nThere was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right to has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and do you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you taught your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they
