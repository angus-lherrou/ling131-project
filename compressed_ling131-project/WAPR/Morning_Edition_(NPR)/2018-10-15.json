President Trump says the U.S is trying to figure out exactly who is behind the disappearance and alleged murder of journalists ...\nThe president told sixty minutes that if the top leadership in Saudi Arabia is responsible there will be severe punishment Saudi Arabia continues to deny any involvement and\nSaid that if the U.S imposes sanctions it will retaliate\nThis was one subject covered in a wide ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump\nNPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now going good morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad been someone which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be if Saudi has proven to have been behind us he\nNot and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales or ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said the\nAction but he said that that is not a what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong action and\nHe at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be yes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House what did he say he

Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's race horses and the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum shelf them I'm so she'll filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nAnd oh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably your global sales have been out\nFacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom distorted a sealer but yes they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with a well a NAFTA and the EU agreement so what\nHave people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts as fully mhm and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just you ...\nWhat does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nWe'll ah we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious this is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon being indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell you better make jak beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been a a I think that's when you\nCan start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking\nBefore you know we might lose people far industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations\nEric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nWe turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida Panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since Hurricane Maria\nHurricane Michael hit impassable rode the non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nWater just on the outskirts of still forty miles\nAcross ... works in the fraud division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying on aerial shots that aside at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas of last a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler than adjuster without insurance in Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away but less sleep all sorts of didn't go as her livelihood\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but ... says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm reasons worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\nBack to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know when you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed all their belongings showed her pictures low amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your parents that are passed away to your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild can you know what I'm asking NPR News [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nNew run the country prison discipline coming down harder on women you can get written for not closing your doors you've written up for jumping on the phone without permission and those low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time it was sad because on this\nThe way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute ...\nAgenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLike it's no fun to be a perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect the ruins of for some who had been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because look if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines Trump\nHas never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party former\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose\nEven if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can go\nThe country they can govern that means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\n\n\nHow do you get to Carnegie Hall\nWell actually if you can find your way there we're saving a seat for you everyday I'll take you to the great concert halls in this country and around the world will hear the best of recent concert performances that you simply can't find anywhere else plus conversations with artists conductors and composers\nJoined me for performance today from American public media\nToday weekdays at one PM on a PR\nThe morning I'm Steve Inskeep friendly bars now I have a chance for pets a drink\nThey get in the long run of orange juice in Houston Chronicle reports they're making dog friendly beer alcohol free they started making it for their own ... or thinking it would help with digestion they say they're now selling it\nTo more than twenty bars and restaurants the varieties of dark beer include one called mailman malt liquor and IP a lot in the yard It's MORNING edition\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com [noise]\nFrom the zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio with screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot U.

estimated eighty thousand Americans died and a thirty nine year old St Louis man was almost one of them\nNow he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCharlie hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's healthy and in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association in like more than half of Americans\nAnd like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was wrong wrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week in a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nFish are having grown up and running out of time and that was\nStill have a car but by and large ... founder was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause organs to fail\nCharlie was put into medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we're told they may need to say goodbye\nI knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu age a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings did get better for Charlie eventually

Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nStill it's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world trade sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system limestone shelf ... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players uh but uh in the past ten years you're probably your global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to outpaced their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements that well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as the state that voted for president has voted for it\nVoted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means you can Jackie or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he told us he understood exactly that this would this mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nIn America and if you want to sell you better make any concessions beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears\nIs that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations ferret\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to
