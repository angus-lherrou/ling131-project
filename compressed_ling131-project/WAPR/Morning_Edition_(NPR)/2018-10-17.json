protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on a street selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there are still on the street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present a story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is ... why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along background in doing various forms of\nYeah community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there to continue the relationship with the country and she started the project the first registered in two thousand and\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been\nWhich are the first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management gets you\nKnow and ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nEm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my I had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to this story in that after Macintosh junk and was arrested\nCells and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls him or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse with an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well up more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids posts\nThey're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether they chubby its policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro

to identify the cause of this mystery illness we don't know who may be at higher risk for developing them or the reasons why they may be at higher risk\nNothing ... says given the rise in cases the CDC is escalating its response and consulting with a variety of experts to solve the mystery they do know that some kids who get it have also had viruses such as enter a virus another possible risk factor is West Nile virus\nWhich so far there's no common pathogen that links all the cases\nDespite extensive laboratory testing we have not determined what pathogen or immune response caused the arm or leg weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nTesting we have not determined what pathogen or immune response all the arm or lake weakness and paralysis and most of these patients\nGiven that the symptoms are similar to polio a disease that have been almost completely eradicate it and that's when you have pointed out that this does not polio\nRight now we know that polio virus is not the cause of these add them cases CDC is tested every store specimen from math and patients none of the settlements have tested positive for polio virus\nThe CDC says despite the increase in cases AS Sam is a very rare condition affecting fewer than one and a million children but she says it's good to be aware of the signs and symptoms that Ninety percent of those affected our children there are some cases and adults\nWe recommend seeking medical care right away if you or your child develops sudden weakness of the arms her legs\nAnd do the CDC can't give any specific information about what's causing a FM ... says it's good to take general precautions\nParents can help protect their children from serious diseases that following prevention steps like washing their hands thing up to date on
