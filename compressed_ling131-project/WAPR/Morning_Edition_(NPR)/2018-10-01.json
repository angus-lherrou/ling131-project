you live it's often said that you can predict the future as many kids by finding the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data tool being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries chatty has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard law to improve those odds\nSo they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder of what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking Rand counted\nSays that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nI was surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of care map of median income\nIn Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data and I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric ... says the school students are mostly black and Hispanic\nSo we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority\nThat's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year\nThe year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years that it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because areas a flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity ... should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us making really smart really intentional decisions so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to look and say yeah that was the right call\nCharlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction\nMecklenburg county which encompasses Charlotte has committed to providing pre K

the for Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News\nOkay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance and you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to get people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to your medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not\nAnd they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nSo people have something called health insurance but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health

little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin and or not loose are governed by the Palestinian but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger is\nNot this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are actual demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and\nPockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best arrangement we could we could have a lot\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off but here's how it's done we have to say\nSay intelligence about terrorists in one of the Palestinian towns\nAnd we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attack as we ... the un by President Abbas so\nThey want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind internationally final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very busy so I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do final thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you\nIs there also a risk in being so closely aligned with such a polarizing president because he would rather as Israel historically has have\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel they've had a bipartisan support in I Believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you've seen that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we had a\nYou know it's no secret of how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you\nAre in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding guaranteed Israel a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements and you have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nBy Minister Netanyahu was

parliament this part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd post interrupt joins us now from the Kurdish city of ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Curtis parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most fun of people you have to be\nImplemented in reality but fortunately for you to the walkers and making things ...\nInside the most almost lost huh\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turned out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even a disapproved polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean\nSuper squeaky clean people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations to help the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there is an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd the central government in Baghdad so what uh how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government tension tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for whatever emerges from this new government in the next couple\nOf days NPR's Jane Arraf in the Kurdish city has to ... thanks so much shame

to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nShadi and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard law to improve those odds so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a

percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside

serious disease considered this last winter some eighty thousand people died from the flu and its complications\nGet fewer than half of Americans get vaccinated each year and NPR's Allison Aubrey found a place where vaccination rates are often lower college campuses\nIt's not a surprise when young adults think they're invincible and when it comes to the flu shot survey data backs this up I talked to students at George Washington university when asked you guys have you've had the flu shot this\nYear or not you know I just think how do you wish I had gone in a survey\nData shows one of the top reasons young adults opt out they say they're healthy they don't think they'll get the flu jak gross and ... say they've heard\nThis yeah I think that's definitely think people really don't get it because I don't see a need for it so they're like oh I haven't gone before so I don't need to get the flu shot another optical\nGetting the flu shot can be a hassle miles ... Christian joins say it's just not top of mind\nLike if you have class in work the are going to you know I feel like flu shots not very harmless priorities yeah something of a huge portion other day and trying to get it\nThese students say they plan to get a flu shot if they haven't already and one factor that mean motivate them as last winter death toll with eighty thousand flu related deaths it was the highest death toll and more than forty years\nTall and more than forty years and hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized William Schaffner is medical director at the national foundation for infectious diseases\nWill it was an extraordinary season we had a very vicious virus the so called each three and two influenza strain\nSchaffner says it's too soon to say if this will be a severe flu season but he says that's no reason to wait to get vaccinated Schaffner says it's true that people sixty five and older are at higher risk but he says young adults are vulnerable to\nThe flu can even on occasion take a young healthy person and put them in the intensive care unit in forty eight hours we can't pick you out in advance so let's all get protected\nOn the George

on campus and I just wanted to prevent myself from getting sick and from anyone else with him or her own\nBitter what do you want right or left let's take this is the famous shot at from this one two three hours\nAfter such a bad flu season last\nYear many people know the vaccine is not a hundred percent effective but what many people don't realize is if you get the flu shot and still end up catching the virus your sickness is likely to be significantly less severe student max Web says\nHe'll take some protection over no protection I've had the flu which was horrible and so after that experience I\nWill be a reason why even riskier without getting back to the Web says he thinks one way to motivate young people to get the flu shot it would be a social media campaign where people share their flu stories I asked him what he calls the camp\nThey moved to the flu I don't know that\nJust came up with that now I like I said with the flow it's got a good ring and maybe it's\nA reminder to get the shot before Halloween Allison Aubrey NPR News okay if you're looking\nFor a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits\nBecome fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak they're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to get people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products available in the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years is stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met\nSo people have something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years\nThat market could grow to about one point two million people\nAllison Kojak NPR News

hundreds more\nPhysically and mentally I can try to healing private or I could just lead by example one survivor helps others confront the aftermath of their near death experiences\nWell they have any of them now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin then or now blues are governed by the Palestinian but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are actually demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and\nPockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have\nAnd you you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question\nHow come you don't see that much terrorism in a in the west bank well first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority\nThat's good I'm going to have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by us but here's how it's done we have say intelligence about um uh terrorists\nIn a one of the Palestinian towns and we would call up typically the\nPalestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it\nBecause I don't want to send our soldiers there if we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the risk within attacked as we weren't at the un by President Abbas so\nThey want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nInternationally final thing minister because I Know your time is very busy so I Hope you\nI Know your time is very briefly I Hope you got the irony of what I I understand\nI Do final thing you have been very closely allied with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have bipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel is a a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you you know we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers is for example we\nYou know it's no secret I disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time we signed an animal you\nAre an animal you are the memorandum of understanding going through those are all a very important American Juniors or if it was for the coming decade and and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements with you have a basic agreement about the importance of our
