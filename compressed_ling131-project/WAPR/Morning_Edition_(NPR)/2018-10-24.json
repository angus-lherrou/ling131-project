power and this fall state elections Democrats want to take some of that power away\nYou know the old DNC had a faith based approach to mid term elections do we pray that the candidates would win but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices and legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nAh what you're saying is the narrow margins by which no seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines\nIn charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appeared to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right well\nI Would raise a couple of points on that first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interests of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure versus\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties\nTo do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred

conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the

hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices and legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMet Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYou have a one seat majorities in a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and a number of other states are quite close further compounding or what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten ...\nAnd the number of other states are quite close further compounding or what you're saying is the narrow margins by which no seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tie between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where that came from right [noise] well\nI Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed has to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a state wide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public could\nHave that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is to understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand eight team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a and a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... of member station ... has more [noise]\nThe water rushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate milk\nIt's been so turned off by flooding brown SEAL Team and when it goes to Austin treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they're going to use for drinking and food ... you can probably guess what happened next non ...\n... yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many\nBottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I think about you know just ... that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\n... is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure if it loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water\nTreatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure if it loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there a says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up\nMore silt and

cabinet secretaries who broke the rules protecting Obamacare finding out what went wrong with hurricane relief and tackling other issues that Republicans have brushed off\nOne master of oversight is former congressman Henry Waxman during forty years in the house he investigated everything from the tobacco industry to the Iraq War\nWaxman listed three goals have good oversight stopped a waste of money hold people accountable and make government work the way it should his word of caution to House Democrats don't do oversight the way the Republicans have recently\nThe committees in Congress
