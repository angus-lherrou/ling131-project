somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they wanted to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important normal politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money when\nHe was born in Nineteen thirty to a well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a sort of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics and their life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into finance he moved to New York he opened\nOne of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich [noise] well\nI'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England\nCouldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark and when the person's right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy are descended into\nGeorge mark and when the person's right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in the east European countries where his finance ... had a clear political confidence which was to build for less than\nThat he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote causes there was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the media was slurring me because it's sort of sorrow and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly become seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked and says he just because he had so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expended rationally because actually is for them to be a cool the open society Institute He's very open about ... about where the donations go so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics who say he's shadowy I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Jewish finances are portrayed as the shadowy figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\n[noise] well what do people in his native hungry think of Soros\nHe was a hero early on in the transition away from communism things have turned more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism that has taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books in a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much thank you\nPresident Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris it's kind of tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nThan fifty years voted in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina had been pending\nMajor ships in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\nDid hear Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David a Clinton a professor of political science at ... college says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from a farm or they still see that raises ... it would have been favorable two decades ago for a Republican president me becoming unprovoked district\nNick Clinton said that because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he says like the rest of America Democrats in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you go\nYou look at the political fine for them and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs are on one side of the county line and you're moving to another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's Trump country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray gas ... says the

this year but China once a major market for soybeans impose a twenty\nFive percent tariff slashing imports that knocked two dollars a bushel off the price awesome and then we'll get costing him tens of thousands of dollars\nIt's one more thing that we have pretty much no control over it seems like that affects us greatly so I guess we're just kind of rolled in with the punches here on this\nAnd the punches keep coming this year besides the terrorists persistent rain pushed harvest back by weeks and there's the new tax law that could have a big effect on farmers who sell their crops to the local grain cooperative\nIowa State university ag economist Kerry Jacobson says the laws changes make who to sell to a dicey proposition that's what's hard to nail down and that's where farmers are in their marketing decision process at this point for example a farm with lots of employees might be better off selling to a private ethanol plant\nBut one with no employees might benefit from joining a co op Mike Howland who farms near Huxley Iowa serves on the border heartland co-op\nHe says even though he's been paying close attention he still doesn't understand how that changes will affect his bottom line\nI contacted my accountant about it and he's still going to school and learning about it so he didn't feel comfortable at this point advising\nFor now Helen more concerned with bringing in his crop most of us will be glad when this year just over the agriculture department promised farmers twelve billion dollars to help offset the tariff impact but ... says that's not a real sex but we

then I Wish they had the economist Chad Hart says higher prices are on the horizon\nAnd so as we look out into the spring of twenty Nineteen we do see some reasonable prices out there but that means we're gonna have to have this crop for six seven months to get there\nAnd with all the rain some elevators are storing soybeans that can't sit that long meanwhile Mexico Malaysia Indonesia and even Argentina have stepped in to buy us soybeans\nChina wouldn't bought a lot of friends from Argentina left them with it too short they had to come into the world market they bought some from us and so you're seeing some really interesting trade flows\nBut still about two hundred million bushels that would have gone to China need to find another customer\nOn dry days farmers are razor focused on just getting in this late crop but with terrorists taxes and quality to worry about this nerve wracking season isn't going to end when the last beans hit the Ben friend PR News I'm Amy Mayer in Ames,

I I don't know how like that got raises hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David\n... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News for all your kids watch at home than it is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't ah the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges

... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something in making Kelly's colleagues an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced she accused her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular collies\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her
