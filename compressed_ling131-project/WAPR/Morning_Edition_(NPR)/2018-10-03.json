his Supreme Court nominee at a rally last night in Memphis\nAt a rally last night in Mississippi he outright mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford who's accused nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where I don't remember how many I don't [noise]\nEarlier in the day in front of reporters in the rose garden the president worried aloud about the upshot of the Kavanaugh hearings\nVery scary guy for young men and America what you're going to be a seal the suffering but you may not be guilty of\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he plans to vote on of the full Senate this week on the Kavanaugh's nomination NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell is in the studio with us this morning I can say they're\nSo President Trump clearly believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night do Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh\nAnd this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and I think she probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct and that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all\nOf this and Republicans it took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say she's credible right\nThey have gone they're gone out of their way to create a paper trail and to kind of make\nThe case that they are listening to Ford and they're going through all of the appropriate steps of having the FBI investigation the supplemental investigation into these accusations so that they can say that this isn't political but I talked to a lot of senators who worried that the concept and the conversation about sexual assault is becoming political as a result of this hearing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the next fresh air camera Jenkins talks about writing and directing her new movie

minorities in the world and feel like they are not represented in politics\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War it was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so and broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to but today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone\nHas some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nI shudder to think that the president might be using such as just there for political purposes or great I I version of the presidency was under threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real concerns I it'd be so one thing about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes that wants to turn people cell phones it's a government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded well there is no opting out of the alert\nSystem is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and besides he has Twitter for that Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\nAnd coming up later today on all things considered we'll hear from one of the beneficiaries of the new

week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and now it's\nSwedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in Stockholm\nOr whatever you're going to talk of the main ordered all this stuff to last you know from the vent decision be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winters presumably you're not going to do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won so half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and\nThe other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process I mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemical\nThe chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuel or better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on that's I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel that the no bells are ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular parts you\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean for instance Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up All right NPR's\nNell Greenfieldboyce with the news that the Nobel Prize for chemistry

because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't

I'm Rachel\nMartin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nName is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee found to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we're still remains that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and just go right\nOnly about a dozen they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John round off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result\nOf what is it worth these lifetime appointments\nWell lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age semi both are there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank yous names commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions\nI'm

think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak

says Donald Trump's net worth President Trump's network has dropped more than a billion dollar since he declared he was going to run in twenty sixteen how did that happen\nWell there are a couple of different factors there you know part of it's just business markets part of its us doing better reporting figuring out things like he was lying about the size of his penthouse for years and now we know that it's smaller than he said but the most interesting part is the effect that trumps the presidency is having on Trump the brand\nSo um this is a brand that is so intrinsically linked to him I mean he puts his name on everything from stakes to hotels to neck ties um can you point to which of those products or buildings for that matter are suffering and and why specifically\nProducts business almost doesn't exist anymore businesses just don't want to take the risk of putting name on his name on their products and you know he built a lot of things in New York and New York is not a

Inskeep the historian Hampton Sides has been exploring the origins of the U. S. conflict with North Korea he's written a history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\n[noise] that's\nA radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea had started the war invading the U.S back so the United states and its allies struck back with this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\n\nDouglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe war I reached a turning point as a fresh start in and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that MacArthur devised next\nStop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one Democrat\nDemocratic government\nMcCarthy's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario for encirclement he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure and none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots\nOn you know this is Hector calf Retta\nTo receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never kill demand for I'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty of thousand trapped in the choice in reservoir slog than there are ways sixty bitter miles to the evacuation important to them\nEvacuation important to them no\nSnow but the prices they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korean leave by smoke who wasn't\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escaped to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered he had to hide out in a house in\nSeoul he hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruins if they took it back\nThe capital city of\nImmediately volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ...\nWhat ... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\nHe was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life and he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American

emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book\nBecause this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law what is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know\nI'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned his sons any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State to help to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised\n... or hiding something the FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump Lee is a retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he hopes to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nCircumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin Kaste NPR News [noise]\n\n\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\n[noise]\n\n\nOn the way here on MORNING edition we'll get the marketplace morning report coming up at a few minutes but first we'll hear from NPR columnist commentator Cokie Roberts will be answering some listener questions about the leak contested Supreme Court nomination throughout the country's history\nThat on the way here on MORNING edition you're listening to a PR support\nFor Alabama public radio comes from our listeners and in part from the sponsors\nTheater cats ... west Alabama community theater providing quality entertainment and educational outreach for more than four decades information about auditions workshops and performance is at theater task dot com or two year old five three nine one to two seven\nOne to two seven seven\nAnd take a look at today's forecast work expecting highs and the low nineties for the most part across the listening area partly to mostly cloudy skies today slight chance of showers maybe an isolated thunderstorm near the Gulf Coast\nBut stay in drive for the most part in North and central Alabama very warm and humid conditions heat index values end of the triple digits lose tonight the upper sixties to mid seventies hundred mostly clear skies it's a PR\nJ.

News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall to them earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nRobert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and whites\nAnd no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents of sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean that is not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with them over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a before deceptive chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first appeared before the Judiciary Committee\nWell who the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nWould be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John round off in the house of representatives said he'd wipe the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew um but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the\nAnd that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it what these lifetime appointments\nWell lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age them both a there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you Steve commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about
