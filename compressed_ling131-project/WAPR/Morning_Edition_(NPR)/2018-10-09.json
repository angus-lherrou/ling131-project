was a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from it\nAnd from Interpol I talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my whole month\nAway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese had of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt you at a scape China\nAs it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhat China's government has been released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife greats among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France were in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nWe had to go in and you know what I Am the half of my how do they will make ... ... ... all the\nWind and children's husband and father so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back\nTurned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well\nWhen she talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julian Kong the highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rule China and he was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol\nWell even before this happened China's use of Interpol under amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted issue in red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person for an exile\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology\nFrom Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard likes that system he's in Lewiston in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on so there are steps are going to be half of war or taking and their belts are going to be chained together so you're walking down the line it's got a like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take them right in the back put 'em in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera and the conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because of watching everybody get up and go in front of the screen and it's either yes or no or you know you couldn't ...\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say\nListen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nA shortage glued to the judge what happened and they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison where Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national\nLegal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began\nYou already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process\nYou are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my client stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say at the trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News ...\nYear after Harvey Weinstein and meet to New York as an acting the country's

in the works if it passes Alaska with an act a much tougher permitting process for big project\nFor permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat\nAmong other things it would set strict standards for restoring salmon streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties would acknowledges that in a state like Alaska it's a big

companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of ads like this lawyer\nClaim to protect the habitat but it's

Mobil they've raised more money than all free of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turn Matthias is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far coexistence with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nThe funniest thinks the initiative prioritizes salmon at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers\nWe couldn't have the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans similar more than just a living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source

tornado went through the heart of urban densely populated midtown wheel and it went right down our street\nFortunately we were visiting my parents and Indiana at the time and I think the fact that it was Christmas meant that a lot of people were out of town or they were in their homes instead of driving home from work and so there were no deaths or injuries\nDid affect our lives in a pretty significant way so I just thought maybe we could take some time to remember that\nWhat do you remember about finding out about the tornados that it had happened I remembered seeing like really horrified and worried\nAbout all this stuff is going to lose I didn't end up losing much that I was really scared at the time\nAnd I'm surprised you said the stuff in your room was still there 'cause
