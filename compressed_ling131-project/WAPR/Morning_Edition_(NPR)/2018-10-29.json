own and he is from the far right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election who will take office on the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy\nAnd let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can redrawing here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey use for the restoration of national pride and I think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insists the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted and afterwards he read out part of the constitution to reporters\nThe need for the future presidents who respects to the judge had to remind him and and people that people will reveal about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which this is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes oil they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent and on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nReally on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and\nI'm Andrea he's really on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high murder rate yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people [noise] because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is rolling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people

took a close look at a medical bill that you've sent us and today we're going to hear about an unexpectedly expensive bill for a skin allergy dressed from ... in San Francisco reporter April Dembosky have story [noise]\nWhen Janet Winston goes to the doctor she feels up on gas and packs a sandwich and two big services so black and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile fry Winston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drives six hours one way to Sanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months\nIt was itchy and like read the like poison oak\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb new ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBends pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it\nWinston left then came back two days later\nAnd they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for\nSources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder six hundred solar engine does it have the top of the line Bluetooth stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of that\nWhen students insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the math just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars\nProducts come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin tests is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from home instead senior care committed

thousand that's according to report from the Williams Institute at UCLA Jody Herman is one of its authors\nTrans people are in a unique position that there is a whole administrative system governing how trans people are able to get accurate IDs\nEach state handles gender and name changes differently in Georgia a judge has to approve a name change\nTo change the gender marker on your driver's license you needed doctors letter saying you've had gender reassignment surgery\nThe problem is that there are different kinds of transgender surgeries and some trans people don't get any surgery at all Chanel Haley works for Georgia quality which advocates for the L G Beatty community she says the Georgia process leave room for objective interpretation by judges and DMV employees\nThat's where

November\nSometimes I can just show someone my ID and had my finger over the gender marker and they don't even look\nI Am very fortunate that some people can tell that I'm trans\nSo sometimes I can just resign\nOfficials and Fulton County where Atlanta is said poll workers aren't supposed to check for gender but every county trains poll workers differently there is a workaround for gender markers getting a passport because the federal government does not require the surgery that's another hurdle though and costs time and money\nKrista O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride uh Georgia\nSurgery that's another hurdle though and costs time and money Christian O'Neil is a transgender woman from Atlanta who was also at pride at Georgia judge rejected her name change even though she's been living as a woman for years\nIt's going to be really difficult to to save up any money which sucks because like I Love to have a name that actually matches what I go by and like I Love to have a gender like or that match what I Am\nBecause of that mismatch she sometimes faces skepticism and hostility and she has to show ID\nIt hurts a lot and then you definitely do feel like a like Georgia doesn't really care about about a chance to be cool\nBut despite the difficulty O'Neill still plans to vote in this election for NPR News I'm Emma hurt in Atlanta [noise]\nAs

that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why both not a defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of

democracy and it's essentially shoe but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's really on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really but\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age

nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise and you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was part of\nThe reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think well the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain\nTo say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look
