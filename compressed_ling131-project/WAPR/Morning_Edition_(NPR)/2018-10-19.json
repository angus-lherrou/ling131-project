term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the ... we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around they were eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [noise] how Tran is the ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter\nHe's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom a window like him very much\nAnd then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far\nSearch and Burma and like him very much\nAnd and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far sofa\nIn this country who who do we do what do you like what do you you're unemployed rate the low uh-huh and um stock market in a row seat in Greece and so the economy's important do you yeah\nAnd that this is this is um I open\nIt [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of Trump because we haven't talked about that or is this the first time yeah and I had a surprise because then I'll have a conversation\nAbout the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how on democratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that with the reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu alive like all the whole ball and yelled out GM neither of them\nAre from time to press talk about what these changes\nBut they don't care about the truth and\nYou're just has so yeah CNN events drum riff off to both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if you're does is the al\n... they spend a lot I think it'll apple I'm Trump\nBoxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think do you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump it's not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered in through the election this country mhm\nBut when they know that\nWhy they don't listen before the election [noise] the way until room both elected and the money issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with\nBoth elected and the Lakers shoe\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with yeah the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't get your don't believe that you know\nThey're doing proven that don't need to believe them\nYou know through the mud on either FBI then just don't know which as John ... he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some of you agree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views of Trump what is your dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly am strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom and that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes book for toys\nAnd for future the weird thing\nTo think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention any he um after the war he was\nA political prisoner for a ...\nA two year three years he was held in a political concentration camp or another I let you\nDo a re education to get him\nYeah we're the communist tries to you know basically get him to change his thinking\nIt's powerful to hear you say that people should vote coming from mhm the history that you have\nYeah I just think we need to look to protect our democracy\n... drone motorized ... roam the next time we make it dry how we have another chance

mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversations because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here
