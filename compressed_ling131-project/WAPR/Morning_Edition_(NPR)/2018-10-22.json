team sports can be tremendously important to someone who's depression is exacerbated by isolation\nIn study the patient self reported their symptoms which Dr bomb says is a weakness because people don't always accurately report how they're doing additionally sticking with any exercise can be a challenge\nWhen you have to press patient motivation is often lacking\nWithout motivation should
