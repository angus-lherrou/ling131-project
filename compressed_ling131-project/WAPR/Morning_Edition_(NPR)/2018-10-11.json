Trump or it would really be confusing for him to allow human rights abuses at an in another country\nUm to stop him from trying to take advantage of a pretty good relationship um UC what he's been saying about the north Korean Supreme leader for example in the same interview that you are earlier\nA presented Trump also said that he wouldn't want to reduce arms sales to Saudi Arabia because that would hurt the United states\nBut this is not just a a human rights abuses if this turns out to be true in Saudi Arabia actually killed a journalist on Turkish soil ah I mean Lindsey Graham Republican senators saying they would have to be held to pay isn't that going to increase the pressure on President Trump to to do something here\nWell I'm not sure well I mean you know the the the media was more outraged I think about Trump's\nIndividual meeting with President putting in Helsinki and the press conference afterwards I mean even Fox News and a number of the Republicans were on the defensive around it but we're not talking about that anymore um look I mean you and I can say that it is horrific um\nFor the most popular Saudi journalist to be what looks like pretty clearly um killed 'em in a consulate abroad in not in American allies conflict brought by the way but I don't think that means that Trump is going to be pressured it what what is interesting of course is the ability of the Senate\nAnd others to constrain Trump's foreign policy when they feel that he's acting beyond the pale is significant and in the same way that we've seen I'm sick it increases in sanctions against the Russians that Trump has attempted to slow walk 'em I think the same thing is likely to occur\nThese heavy Saudi Arabia and and that's going to be very interesting to watch over the coming months especially because Trump is putting so much pressure on Iran or at it after pulling out of the nuclear deal the about enemy of Saudi Arabia and Congress has been quite on board with that so these two things are going to come together is\nThe government known for intimidating their citizens who live abroad that surprising in some way\nUm it it again it's it's gotten worse certainly um but he's been threatened before\nUm you know he was forced out of his job um he was defending a lot of his friends who were opponents of the Saudi regime a he has a lot of friends in the United states in high places but there's no question that he was considered to be a a real problem ah for the Saudis the Saudis overreact\nHe's over reacted to the Canadians I Won the Canadian government took umbrage at a Saudi behavior you will remember of course a just a year ago all of those Saudi princes that war\nI did change in the Ritz Carlton there were some reports of torture when
