name any help and you know so and they went out and and he made and then we went ... and ... and how he made\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter

climate leadership council says the firm's financial contribution is a significant step\nThat the first time in history that a U.S oil and gas super major has put significant financial resources behind a direct price on carbon\nIn other words a direct tax on carbon though bird will soon group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurden since says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most

House who campaigned on reviving the coal industry\nSt passing a carbon tax will be very difficult\nI don't think there's any way of sugar coating of Republicans today to embrace any new tax is

delirious weeks in the hospital was near death experience asked saw during gray asked us how\nAll the other side of a river\nIt looks like the original lied Shia a larger the prophet who's miracles included\nIncluded resurrection of the dead [noise] his mother leader says at one point hospital staff were so sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the day shift\nThe thing that's amazing is his talking to us and his like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that but I Would say it ... we were at the rehab I bat for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way out of a ticket that's physical emotional and cognitive though he's still reached the New Yorker

patients tell us what a misery this form of dementia is it permanent\nIt's permanent in some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain tissue study which we didn't hear at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out\nMany of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury re Alzheimer or even sometimes are farmers itself\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the ICU ... says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increase risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of ... you got a almost a sure thing that

S.\nThe Dodgers have long had a very rich pipeline to the Caribbean and to Cuba and one document that we cited in in the article they at some point had an internal\nInternal ranking system of just how corrupt some of their own scouts were\nAs high executive editor John ... says that at one point the Dodgers called one of their own employees unbelievably corrupt or if I'm told me that in order to get access to top baseball talent in Cuba teams often go through agents called boost counties\nThe ... is a middleman based in Latin America who essentially takes equity stakes and prospects sometimes it can be forty fifty sixty percent of future earnings but for prospects desperate enough that's a that's a rift undertake\nAnd now it might be a legal risk according to Sports Illustrated the Justice Department is investigating whether some teams broke federal corruption laws to sign Cuban players\nExtraction of Cuban players has always been shrouded in mystery in baseball but this evidence that the FBI was presented with and we were as well indicates that ah the complicity runs potentially to teams and agents as well as the middle man the ... that have always been implicated in this\nAnd is it basically impossible for a baseball player in Cuba to find his way into the the major leagues without help from one of these middle man\nIt's very difficult part of that is\nBecause of the embargo of Cuba and a player must establish residency in another country usually in the Caribbean or Mexico before coming to the U.S [noise] so what you have is a network of the street level agents that really have been operating outside of\nAnything that the u._s. or major league baseball has dress diction over\nSo you obtained these documents that are ... you say offer a window into how baseball teams operate in Latin America especially in Cuba can you explain what you found and what it says\nWe were given a hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents that were also turned over to the the FBI the Stasi what it shows is that teams and agents have what seems pretty clear from the documents any way on a level of complicity and in some cases that's\nScouts on the tape and in some cases that is about helping to arrange documents using outside counsel to\nEssentially falsified documents and one does think that this is something that could implicate teams in major league baseballs and institution which is something that hasn't really happened before this is the first time so far as we can tell where you have this level of documentation\nClearly I mean as you've articulated this has been somewhat of an open secret for\nSomewhat of an open secret for for generations really but now that you have the documents that ... that allegedly show some of this a dubious recruiting behavior do you watch these players on these games differently\n[noise] it's interesting as applied with us information you do watch the game and some of these players differently you realize that the story of the extraction is often a lot more complex than if perhaps portrayed as being and you also wonder about the economics but again a lot of these players are not operating under the standard\nRate for agents you know four or five percent agent fee is not applying in a lot of these cases and to me one thing you think about is just how many people along the way how many institutions even have profited by these players making it to the major leagues", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Selma", "day": "10"}
