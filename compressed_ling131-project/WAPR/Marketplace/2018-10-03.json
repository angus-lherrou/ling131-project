Tim guy all thought that that could be holding the type that we got to stop we were wrong as it turned out there was a succession of failures after that are ... and it didn't comment in lemon remember is the biggest financial series of all time with Fannie and Freddie which were government designed run your goals\nHey I still dealing with by the way fending for exactly what they did a I G afterwards hundreds of mortgage brokers went bankrupt so yeah it's it was ... I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us knew all so many places I've forgotten number how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again\nYou should never be satisfied and I think I'm more explained that we're doing the regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap\nI give you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not\nTwenty being a capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity remote over capitalized for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a ... or early unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was all ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still sort of my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening away from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and then stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly the way we expected so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like China's it can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and makes you can handle bad outcomes ...\nJumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in the second ... but the money back you up for me\nOn the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff but as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait and I'm not that I mean I I I Want to it but the good and the bad guy so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico are we've got it\nIn Mexico or we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... it and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and the architects of the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all I appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some\nReality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said in the at the un across town a couple of days ago is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had war we countered Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's extreme quite well and we should treat them very respectfully\nBut you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into that look we advise the president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon ... barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day the president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie\nDiamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks still am I I'm going to be competing with the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than the market value\nThis somebody's trying things make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they should they're fine they are Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also have to compete one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and so I I look at\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're going to competitors I Want jeep more chase me to best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank and it would be I think it'd be a mistake for America the best brings in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks will so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nUh get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy that is true for banks a trooper auto companies are true for law industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients\nThat it's not the company because\nCapitalism forces to return to the company lower our ... and also our size and diversity is why we had no issues to distort [noise]\nThere was a whole lot more to that interview of course
