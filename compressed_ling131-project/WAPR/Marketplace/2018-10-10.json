I Know it's unnerving an eight hundred and thirty one point drop on the Dow all three major indices down more than three percent today\nBut about which there are two things to say first of all markets go down as well as up especially after they had been going up so far so quickly that is an important point and completely normal number two\nThere are a lot of reasons why this is happening chief probably among them that quickly rising yields that his interest rates in the bond market that we have been telling you about the last ten days or so and concurrent Marines about inflation all of the above I have to say again\nOur normal but admittedly off putting when interest rates have been so low for so long and markets have mostly gone up\nWhat is interesting though is that what's been going on in this economy is financial markets is affecting the rest of the world case in point treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Chinese currency today and an interview this morning\nBut it was you know Beijing against what he called competitive devaluation of the UN that's the Chinese currency that is China trying to get a global trade edge by making its currency and therefore its goods cheaper for others to buy\nThink trade war and terrorists here and we should point out that the UN is about ten percent cheaper today than it was last spring but his marketplaces Tracey Samuelson reports that might have more to do with what's going on here than what the Chinese are doing\nThe wind has been losing value against the dollar but you know what it's had lots of friends I met during\nDollar is

Need to separate like explanatory framework to explain China\nYes China's economy isn't growing as fast as it once was and\nThere is concern about the heavy debt Bernard fifth and take it out and buy local government and banks lots of bad loans\nSo that is definitely a part of the bonds depreciation but mostly everyone along at all or Steve hanky at Johns Hopkins university says if anything the Chinese have tried to keep the value of the one from falling further they're not working to make it cheaper\nThey haven't done anything any differently than they've been doing for a long on\nThe dollar is like this glowing orbit drawing people in things to a strong US Economy and rising interest rates better tempting investors with higher returns but as the files it does have this the fact that the Trump Administration doesn't love ... is a trade policy professor at Cornell\nSo the tightest measures that the Trump Administration has put them in votes in China now are much less bulletin in other words uh been persons that if on Chinese imports doesn't amount to much if the Chinese currency depletion is by almost an identical alone\nFor that things minutiae and was trying to warn China not to get any ideas about using its currency as a weapon and the country's ongoing trade war Chinese officials said yesterday they have no intention of devaluing their currency I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWhile the drudgery structure and the foreign exchange markets in ... and the trade war get all the headlines there is another way the United states interact with the global economy that's at least as significant and it fits\nUnder the general heading of regulatory review the White House said this morning and this has bipartisan backing in Congress that should be said but the White House announced that the committee on foreign investment in the United states ... as it's called is going to start taking it much closer look at\nForeign investment in the United states ... has that won\nThe new rules are meant to protect our national security now apply when a foreign firmer individual tries to invest in certain sensitive areas such as technology everything from aircraft parts makers to a I to semi conductor makers read lots of Chinese companies\nBut also other kinds of companies says Gregory who sits in a partner at law firm fully in larger\nFinancial institutions

potential foreign investment or face civil penalties the agency will have to sift through thousands of additional filings a lot more work when it's already lacking some say enough resources to get a job done more work to for foreign companies that want to invest here\nTony Fratto is a former Bush administration official now at consulting firm Hamilton place strategies he says the tightening up an additional powers recipient could have a chilling effect\nI Do think that maybe they're charge has gone too far\nFratto says foreign investment dollars could be redirected to Europe or Asia\nAnd those investment dollars go other places and we're we are actually strengthening our competitors in some cases our national security or photos\nWhich would defeat the purpose of these new stricter regulations in New York I'm Janet Babin for marketplace\nWall Street today as I said not so good also remember I mentioned people are starting to get worried about inflation we get numbers on prices at the consumer level it's called the consumer price index technically tomorrow morning so there is that to look forward to stocks way down on this Wednesday will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\nOne of the few things Republican and democratic political professionals agree on is that the midterm elections twenty seven days hence are going to turn on turn out in the weeks left no small fraction of the record amounts that are going to be raised and spent on this election is going to be directed from we at getting out the vote with one especially elusive group\nIn mind marketplaces Kimberly Adams has out\nSeveral times a week a couple of dozen volunteers gather at the historic woman national democratic club in Washington DC and they said it along you shaped table and do their part to get out the vote I volunteered\nMore this mid term these and then I have an any other election\nOn the day I visit Nicole clean Dexter is handwriting postcards to potential voters yes handwriting postcards that had the outline of the state of Virginia which is just across the river\nTheir fellow Democrat we need your vote to flip the vets\nVote to flip the fifth on November So this election is so important in your voice is more important\nThat fellow Democrats name and address may well have come from a list of likely voters people who have voted before lots of get out the vote money is aimed at getting those voters to show up on election day\nBut that money could be better spent elsewhere says Clarissa Martinez she's vice president of need us us a nonprofit that focuses on boosting Latino political engagement\nSo what do you see is that the vast majority of resources actually chases highly have vigil voters first and foremost\nWhen what you really need to do says Martinez is bringing new voters\nFor young voters and for communities like the Latino community they simply don't end up making the outraged target of many of those campaigns\nAnd that neglect shows up at the polls only twenty percent of those Eighteen to twenty nine years old voted in the last\nMidterm in twenty fourteen which is one reason social media is full of ads like this one from knock the vote where aging baby boomers mock younger voters\n\nThis is marketplace I'm rebel among the many many many losers on Wall street today as I said was the company the trades under the ticker symbol as each ill the the Sears Holdings group cheers at a record low this morning our news from the wall Street Journal that the company has hired advisors to start pulling together a bankruptcy

out this week there is an economic reality here that needs to be recognized according to the ratings people at Nielsen who looked at digital and physical album sales as well as streaming numbers hip hop and R and be replaced rock as this country's most popular music genres\nBut as often happens there is a twist because what Nielsen didn't consider how much money people spend on concerts and when it comes to live shows rock and roll is still the king rock concerts accounted for more than half of the five billion dollars generated\nBy last year's highest grossing life tours you'll show wrote about rock and revenue for the wall Street Journal welcome to broker thanks for having me when was the last time you were in Iraq I was a properly pretty recently I went to a show at the Warsaw to see a band called all ways\nAlong with snail mail and hatch e okay so it was a surprise nobody listen to this program that I don't know any of those bands but but but it gets to the point of um uh that's where the money is really right hip hop and R B have been dominant culturally for many years now commercially speaking\n... speaking rap is really taking over the industry over the last couple of years so there tends to be this huge focus right at least so on rap and it's important right now but the thing is\nA huge part of the music industry is the other side of the industry not just the recording music side but to live side and something that's kind of been\nKind of obscured lately is how significant rock still is for live music is it just because rock and roll has been around so much longer than than rap and hip hop and all the rest there are several reasons rock also crosses generations in a way that rap doesn't at a rock concert you could have a younger\nA millennial agenda the a music fan who is curious about a particular act and then of course you're gonna get twenty somethings thirty something's forty somethings fifty some things\nBut it's it's more complicated than that guns and roses and older act on the eighth and ninth us guns ... roses is playing stadiums and his playing arenas public enemy and WMA also from ... to\nOr not so one one significant thing is some of the classic legacy pioneering rap acts aren't playing big venues are\nA lot of questions actually come out of that the first is I'm going to a live show is is a disposable income kind of thing right do rock and roll show fans tend to have more disposable income than the folks who would go to see say and the way\nIt is the case that the younger fans of hip hop have less disposable rash so what happens is the economics for an act like juice world who's on top of their charts with this song lucid dreams right now are different ... if you had this lengthy sprawling toured hitting\nA second tier dirtier a cities across the U.S it's not going to work because there aren't it can be enough people to come to that show where they may be a rock act who has older fans with more cash in their pocket\nCan make the economics work um so let's go back even farther ... eventually Mick Jagger is going to die ... and eventually rock and roll fans now were fifty and sixty and remembering in front of you are going to stop going is that going to change the dynamic\nMany people I've talked to feel like this is an elephant in the room for the live music industry and\nUm once the Rolling Stones Paul McCartney is go it is a question Ken than you were acts replaced the older acts and can newer acts in their old age gender the kind of money that the stones do remember the Rolling Stones back in the seventies they didn't make that much money from albums and even ...\nFrom albums and even live they make more money now than than they ever did back in the day to the question is is that a historical anomaly chai tied to rock in the twentieth century\nOr not and one way that the industry is shifting is placing a little bit more focused on festivals and on smaller venues right and and then you roll all of that in with streaming and description downloads and other ways that people can get it besides a lot of men right and it all changed right near shot the wall Street Journal male
