currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he would call China a currency manipulator on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called him a currency manipulator and you know there are reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nA detour

from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting who has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because

clearly towards more money during the darkest\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBut like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need

repeat\nSee comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous

I'm not going to let that happen\nThe Tribune merger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of do that but what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort\nTo appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they
