good as always have your long everybody\nThe number of the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew\nIn the summer quarter July through September ... because you knew there was going to be a buck numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be when the other Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody okay\nSo let me start with you ah and and in the process of asking\nThis question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number yeah\nThe headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the men's and we're seeing it slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I opened the show but I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which in the stimulus feed them\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do when you're emotional\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd tariffs ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market\nBetween really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay Katherine\nNot to um point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out will will ah [laughter]\nSo so here's interest on the street and turf and he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars in the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says church we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nWhat to do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and\nOf international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMueller do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed a chaired by Jay Powell a his biggest uh economic problem I'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about raids what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how they keep the economic for market running how they keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be a land eventually the next session hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink he ... thanks guys\nHave a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping right will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nMm [noise]\n\n\nRight back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because\n[noise]\nAll right back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nTo dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you can start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at ... ...\nWhat you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated that Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher steel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers at the impact of starting to bite\nThis is marketplace I'm tired result there's one gets filed street and see the I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there was a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies\nGo up there cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto\nAnd each one the other out of the business through and decker who's the ... reporter for Bloomberg walk in the program yeah how are you doing today Kay I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\n... old school sometimes is that the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah and she was important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single L T o seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one car\nCrash okay now\nThere's a corporate store you're right there's it Sony and Fuji film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open there used to be six manufacturers now there's two\nAnd those two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin at inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nTo catch him courses that if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT ceasing please don't shut either of them out or we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan who's so there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's another Saddam me that shuts down operations\nAnd give me the upshot of all these ah suits encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent and teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just\nThese are huge and counter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and she put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that blood doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people doing the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running wow\nSusan Decker she's the patents a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure to\nFrom the American pet products association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than sixty nine\nBillion dollars on our pets full disclosure part of that came from me about six million of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us to the point to a series we do called my economy how people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here you go\nName's ...
