California voters a week from tomorrow\nWas marketplace Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road\nCould make the gas tax difference\nHe line Lippmann

I'm\nLiving with the transportation organization called LA\nIs against proposition six because he says the gas tax is necessary\nPoints out the ... ... in the evening\nGot to be by a couple of big titles you're\nLiving in says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less\nAbout a hundred and thirty billion dollars in infrastructure investment in roads and bridges [noise]\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we are hard investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred thirty billion dollar hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop ... campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it but even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these types of having been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason can be seen directly across that\nStreet in downtown LA at a Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of his hat\nPaying

... says take where the draft is how\nDo you know ... or want to root for at least four or five like minded shoulders and screen which are shows us ... of course I'm with this phone you can or the best of it\nLike minded shoulders and screams all ... of course I'm for this phone you can or the best guess is would you regret\nThe way that the the building as designed as the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball's it's kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if ... you know we are one of the player week\nSo we'd rooms and the training room right of course are over there the beautiful way rooms and drove so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need to do that on there\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view a little brown and ... and Magic Johnson drug for basketball and and you know ... and the other best workers have you guys have the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball\nWas that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years you know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and\nCoach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business they don't do so too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right on surgery was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground who said oh yeah when we looked like\nIt it would break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to\nGet the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] on the last ...\nOr want to hear about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who work with and then and then how to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book where we've talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business shows first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nIt was very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nOr anybody will consider investing his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear the music rather Darlene ... it's it's funny because\nWe actually have a DJ now on staff I Know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multitasking there used to having music\nWhile they're doing whatever let me\nShow you don't get under the good you know your way around ...\n... mile and a woman\nI mean actually this is the trophy room I just happened on my desk in here and so I\nRemember going to be this close to interview the trivia trouble that's cool seven rebels that\nThe reason you know it it was important the trophies were displayed so that the players consume them this is the inspiration\nAnd we overlook recording if they look or they will students trophies around\nNow here's a great feature um or me\nIs that what ... have the\nBalcony watch\nNICE Road after matters is going to watch this works out that the war room oh dollar that we were the ... right we're right okay now I have no way\nOf you know\nWay to get into the ... operation or this is a really good a snapshot of you being able to run the airport road from your office to the court right warm rain\nAnd you know again going back to the players wanting to know who's who's standing with them who's behind them\nTotally you know so it is over altogether and that's awesome [noise] creditor it wasn't I Want to get out of your show much ruin your version\n\nOf the grand tour from a woman in charge of the Lakers we saw Jerry Buss was collection of championship brings which is kind of interesting also former liquors coach Phil Jackson's vision of seven series where there's a video for the
