Would I Would hope so he planned for the worst and hope for the best we have always um built a cushion and always tried to pay down debt\nI feel somewhat prepared because I recognized that my security it's in my own hands so that means growing my own food that means having good relationships with my neighbors that means knowing how to\nCreate clean water or ... or what is edible\nLandscaping we own a condo we're still paying on\nStill paying two car payments student loans\nWe still get by but we're not being able to put a whole lot away for retirement\nIt doesn't take too much to go through your savings weighed like if you don't have a income you know so that's where they keeping that steady income you know by keeping the job is very necessary you know\nThat's a real concern is like are we going to have to work that we're Seventy five [noise]\nIt would just take one hospital stayed to ruin us\nHealth care as it happens is this country's top economic concerns twenty eight percent of people said it is the economic issue that worries them the most\nYou can slice and dice are pulled out of yourself that marketplace dot org on Wall street today miles a little slice and dice as well down three hundred down the down up and then down again\nWill have the details when we do not\nWhat other thing we learned in our poll is that a majority of Americans and this was across party lines a majority of Americans say we are in a trade war they're not especially worried about it just ... percent say traded their top economic concern\nBut on the theory that nobody knows which way the current us Chinese trade relationship shall we say is going to go what might get more people more worried one way that things could get asked your is is if China sold off a lot of the American debt\nThat now holds marketplaces traces GM is it looked at the likelihood that might happen\nUS government spends more each year then it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows

us debt about five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan\nI think the notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years to the question is really would China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is\nMore pointed then I think people initially expected but selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount meaning losses for China a fire safety reasons that\nI was ... will be will ... will at UC Davis thinks China would have to be provoked to resort to that it's unlikely that the Chinese would use these option\nUnless I
