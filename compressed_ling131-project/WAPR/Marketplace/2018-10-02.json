Public radio in Denver today I'm Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October second good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop Bezos act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\nThe bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nThat is reportedly true in some states of Amazon well the company announced that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour\nWhat kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact\nIt's going to have the biggest impact on so Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely oh a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon\nAnd its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour\nBut even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does is sort of speed up the the movement in that\nDirection really I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as Wal Mart is by the same token a lot of other firms\nAre already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and costs go right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses um their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement we're going to look at\nHow far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut fewer of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but there's a larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving as the\nProfessor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage\nSo what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best\nAlex ... is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he says he's able to pay his bills and bus fare but earning Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I just ... me is just a permanent job for ... miles but I feel like if you're like forty hours every week or more than that will be alert show much\nSharon ... Peterson is forty two years old and lives in Utah\nShe's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and said she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relies on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on Fifteen dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander Saunders received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off his debts\nI actually just paid off last year at a car loan fight\nHe says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't\nWouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommates\nSplitting rent some was enormous off\nWhile workers in cities like New York Los Angeles in Seattle have seen their wages go up to Fifteen dollars in recent years the fiber Fifteen as it's known continues\nAnd now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm Renata Sago for marketplace we have another slice of the Amazon story on line today\nAnd explainer on monopoly sunny try saying that five times fast and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paying a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nNew NAFTA or as efficiently now in the U.S Mexico Canada agreements reached over the weekend is already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go up\nThat's because one piece of the deal gives years of extended patents protection that is monopoly protection too high end expensive drugs known as biologics that means the trade deal could delay the time it takes for cheaper generic to get to market\nFrom Washington marketplaces Scott tongue reports biologic\nDrugs are complex medicines made in living cells they ... him into suppressants anti inflammatory is very effective in very pricey this trade deal would give biologic makers ten years of patent protection Canada and Mexico which is longer than they enjoy now Bryan popper heads action for trade representing pharmaceutical makers and others\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties so these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nIs that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually fund most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides a which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions\nThey use an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is is that the corps tries to see\nWhich projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example tell me about rape spill beach\nSure right seal beach has been rebuilt I think more than twenty times in history and uh this is a community we found where you know some of the properties right along the ocean are easily worst millions of dollars\nPolice a song she wrote about beach nourishment for for public I think you\n\nFall is here folks according to the calendar anyway\nAnd it's not just the leaves changing color the new season signals a shift in fashion this year I'm told it's all about big shoulders and ... boots awesome in makeup hello burgundy's plums and reds in cosmetics and skin care new formulations for cooler weather\nAs marketplaces Erica Barris reports the way we buy

sell their particular brand\nThat casual atmosphere is especially popular with younger shoppers and that's creating a problem for department stores that goes far beyond the makeup counter\nA lot of departments are traffic has traditionally been driven by cosmetics so if you don't have the consumer I'm going there for cosmetics and she's um she may not be going there at all\nSo Saks Fifth Avenue
