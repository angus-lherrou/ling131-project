October two thousand Eighteen good as always to have your long everybody yes\nLots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was the September unemployment report it was a good no hundred and thirty four thousand new jobs and nearly fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further whereabouts farther afield I never get 'em right Jeff and rebel writes for the Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody Hey Ken Hi Kay\nSo Neal it's jobs the euro and that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that uh the judge important was actually go a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for that right at wages wages where the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was enough to spark some concern in the market\nThe spark some concern in the market that this would spill over to consumer in prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and growth was enough\nAh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rate and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is some amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the named after a China is still out there uh we have a store president ah who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists\nAnd breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric [laughter] suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which I should point out you are a ... and a poet back for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what Katherine was talking about this idea that\nWe're no distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened took a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complex\nIt's more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back\nAnd so as much as markets cheered the continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a U.S flow when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they sit right in the middle of\nYou to have some group launched a slow when that's a great well um okay well let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it or Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine that she was in fact ... go to them for ...\nUh Joe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court or come you know mother Tuesday\nI Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done writer budget to have to get on there are\nSocial programs and and a former bills and all of that stuff still has to be done ... thirty seconds to you and then to me or were those things where things stand\nA I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage or and and the presidency is well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around for the last crisis uh\nTen years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's gonna happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones knew what you quickly for sure\nAnd I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you wanna call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health are a lot of wealth being created in the economy a investor\nInvestors are benefiting where things can wage grounds uh what happens when the economy ... returns as part of the natural business cycle but that's when the government playing the wrong and what we mean at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully I can look at it\nNeal Richardson at a were Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post thanks you too\nThank you have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economic play right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which\nAs you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old that in with what's been going in this week in the bond markets debris and I talked about that yesterday good economic numbers pushing yields that his interest rates higher\nAnd it gets me to this comment from Chris Lowe he's the chief economist at SPN financial he's also a friday regular on the marketplace morning report which in most markets was preempted this morning for shall we say other news anyway Chris pointed out to David Brancaccio this morning\nThat Chris works on a bond trading floor and the people in the bond markets\nThey've got a long long memories\nPeople are really nervous Nineteen sixty nine is remembered as\nThe beginning of the big mistake that that led to Nineteen seventies inflation and particularly the older guys out there they don't like dishes at all and moves and but you know what what I like to remind them is the other thing that happened in the seventies just said oil\nIncrease in price from three dollars to forty you know it would be the equivalent of ah oil costing four hundred dollars a barrel in ten years that might be a little inflationary to\nYeah just a bit west Texas intermediate by the way Seventy four dollars thirty four cents a barrel today that was ... to comment that at the end financial from the marketplace morning report this morning I thought that one deserved to be heard to the broader point that Chris was making up stocks and bonds and rates owned by not such a great day on Wall street will have the details when we do the numbers\nIt's really frustrating because I it's very hard for me to transfer to job\nWhen emigrated from China he has a skilled worker H. one B. visa the problem is that in order to switch jobs he has to transfer his visa from one employer to another\nThat process under the Trump Administration now takes six months

they're taking so long in fact the temporary work authorizations like those given to recent graduates are running out Justin George is with the society for human resources management\nPeople might not be able to start their jobs or continue a lot of people are really looking at a situation where employers are going to have to be taking people off the payroll potentially\nIt's also become more difficult to extend an H. one B. work visa immigration officials have become more strict new rules make it easier for them to reject applications\nIn the last quarter of twenty Seventeen there was a Seventy percent increase in applications held up by further questioning by immigration denials increased forty one percent now Barker is the Chicago based immigration attorney who's seen a lot of clients affected by the new policies\nThere's this while being built um to restrict legal immigration and make it as hard as possible as a deterrent for companies and and uh people to use the process that exists\nJustin ... with the society for human resources management says this is not the best time to be making work visas more difficult\nThere's more open jobs right now than Americans looking for jobs so employers are really looking for the talent they need wherever they're from so visas immigration is obviously required in that situation and in many cases\nUs immigration officials declined to be interviewed for this story but said in a press release back in August that they were committed to protecting wages and working conditions they also said the total number of visas granted\nMet the limit of eighty five thousand set by Congress they are enforcing the law athlete in Sarah Blackwell heads advocacy group protect us workers she sees the policy changes as a way to fight abuses of the work visa system\nAmerican tech workers are being forced to train these foreigners who were coming in and then they lose their jobs\nFirms with more than Fifteen Percent foreign workers do tend to pay substantially less than other firms according to the migration Policy Institute\nThat's definitely a good issue to focus on the age when devious have with of course never intended to replace us workers\nTherapy or as a policy analyst with the migration Policy Institute\nAnd it may not be the best way to go about it in all of these policy changes the ... and he's making life more difficult not only for flight and consulting companies that might be replacing us workers but they're also making it more difficult for legitimate and players that are just trying to hire
