President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a set of his core constituents or centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party in the terms and\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here Mattel or announce that it was going to have laugh so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so ... happy Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment's low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not like\nWell except for some time charges and the tax benefits than benefit from this\nWe went up from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what's not alike\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cuts\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as\nA as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow um and\nIt also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to that Joe uh enjoy the ...\nOn the market thing which I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen for very long time\n[noise] yes I and it's really interesting because the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessor as when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the markets are the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past\nYear and these are dramatic falls like a thousand points that I mean you're ugly snuff and of course Trump used a tweet that if that happened to president should be fired ... bomb administrator is you know here's a tweet\nThere is a river everything what are you ... where he got twenty seconds to do it just really quickly the fed minutes this week and and ... basically saying everything's fine or going to the bruising ridge everybody stay calm\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know there's no reason for him not to trade change course I think the stock market again is not the economy and President Trump should have absolutely nothing to say about the fed\nSo there's actually no reason for drum how to change course it's not in his data and the stock market should not be something that he's worried about in fact he ... with the fed is probably looking at is topping a bubbly jock\nOr an somebody's phone when officers who you're goes you been doing this for a long time now turn your phones off in the studio ...

Hi I'm Jennifer ...\nIt's been a couple of get a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users and a court filing this week should some new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair welcome to the program\nThanks for having me back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalists and pundits that basically\nAnd they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this lawsuit ... maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I I mean I think for publishers this was kind of a second ... they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook adding to face that kind of getting into that traffic so and Facebook says representing video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook that jumping publisher I say OK how high man today invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate right or even higher video producer is how it's happened to places like at MTV News happened get lock it as\nMike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nAre so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but uh and the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said we were ... were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this loss\nAnd the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should we ... video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from his lawsuit this week not only were they lost and president and thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have this ... been advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken fish books a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is that's called the they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd uh yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of the numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or oh I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously\nMedia dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue dark days and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think that this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried clams and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that that it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening in coordination and everybody's going to have the absolutely Microsoft jak writer at a bicycle thank you [noise]\n\nJust followed on the way out today in which I Am sorry to be the one that has to tell you but you don't stand a chance\nJust followed on the way out today in which I Am sorry to be the one that has to tell you but you don't stand a chance I mean yes somebody is going to win\nBut
