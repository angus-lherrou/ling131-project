both above the law\nThat then and\nMan that\nHim and I'm from and um [noise]\n\nWas a boy who\nI Know many many\n... ... ...\nWhen the\n\nBrings the more one\nLot of the\nLove bug\nBit\nGood at that and some of the fact that\nAnybody while\nDon't want to go\nMy husband and our in our work clothes are all like okay uh who's going to pick up the baby from daycare [laughter] and we stay there for a whole week and it was amazing we were actually emitted at the um [noise]\nOn the floor that if you own marrow transplant and ... you know ... it was an everyone at floating is amazing was\nWe got so much help and support and um [noise] we had a lot of great results but ... yeah I mean it was a little easier little son with an IV and it's oh yeah it was an IV all week and\nUh oh oh yeah yeah so [noise]\n[noise] since that time now that was how long ago in March\nMartyrs do any uh late march as an Eighteen year this year\nOkay so since that\nTime now what are you doing or what have we have\nYou been able to do well one of the doctors have been able to do like the real question\nSo in the beginning so he's on low dose chemo which is called ... ... um and you know we had no experience of medicine prior so we're in the hospital totally ...\nI said they're like okay you're going to learn how to administer the shot oh by the way we are all these chemo gloves and don't get it on anything and be totally scared and I'd never seen chemo drugs it actually looks like a neon liquid that looks toxic you know and I'm\nWith the head of practicing on orange him [laughter] and like so sleep deprived don't look okay like if you like [laughter] and um so we got a lot of training or so he started out with a really high dose of\nArgument there yes steroids mhm and um low dose chemo and they kept track of us and when we were\nGoing back for check ins\nQuite often we like weekly two weeks three weeks so he's still on a lot of supplements I'm we're tapering down the steroids and actually meth attracts it's actually gone up a little bit mhm I'm\nSo they ... they would treat it with a team still yeah\nSo basically the disease um it's so your immune system I'm\nNormally knows what to fight off by invaders right in this case it's a very very rare instance where the immune system is ... and its tricked into thinking\nThat healthy cells are foreign so once it kicks in its on overdrive constantly attacked the healthy muscles tissues joins ligaments skin it affects everything at our body and that's why the outside you can't even tell\n'em ... unless you just saw the physical symptoms and we were looking at it like\nWhat was his behavior all is is our child just asking us to carry now he's got a little baby in the house oh oh so you know we're very confused and then it got worse and worse like you would have crime for it to the bottom of stairs and you've got to carry me upstairs we can't do it as her male you know are you ... it was it was a tough time but um [noise]\nBut we got to a point where you know we learned a lot about this disease and and it's it's the immune system in overdrive the reason the of the chemo drug is basically means some system suppressant so that it's okay Brin immune system down which is difficult to because now we have to watch out for germ infections\nYo ... uh you know potentially sick kids coming into the house that type of thing and we have a baby in the baby goes to daycare and you know they have to oh oh so you have a baby is leaving yeah Twenty one month old\nBaby girl oh okay Twenty one month old baby girl lay low wage\nYeah good good so before we break or can you do\nOr what have you been doing to attempt to affect this disease I don't know if that ... ...\nJobs with no ... it's an excellent question and from even before we were diagnosed luckily we're able to connect with the fabulous organization a church Jay I'm dot org and there are a a nonprofit focused solely on a research for the\nDisease I'm and helping the families because we are so spread out bill that network in that community so um you know that we can before were diagnosed there is a lovely lady named Shannon a who'd helped us\nGet a good overview of what we're about to experience because at first year of the toughest rabies families that go through this\nI'm so she'd give us a good coach a session on that and then we went right into a diagnosis knowing you know what was to be expected so we weren't totally blind sided it's still very difficult um process of gifts but\nUm what we've done since then is um you know we've used our network in our uh we both work in sales and we have a large network regionally here it was my wife has been finance\nI'm In media myself so we've tapped a few of our friends and had a lot of you know poke so come to us with opportunities one of those being um kings bowling I'm and can starting a nurturing okay\nWe're gonna talk about that because you have that event coming up so I Want to take a break it's a good place to take a break so I can tell our listeners they are tuned to minority counterpoint over kiss want to wait\nAnd jam in Ninety four and we're going to take a

called bowl to cure Jay I'm with the number two um we bought a URL um and ah if you go to bowl the number to George am dot com um that's where the ticket information is information\nWhen it's going to be as we want it to kind of make um [noise] the biggest wild awareness over the top fun experience for other families too you know meet us interact with us but also to to learn more about this very rare disease and hopefully I'm spread the awareness to their network as well\nI'm In you know fundraising awareness of the two big goals for this\nSo let me just I don't mean to you but are are there other parents locally that are that child subjected to this disease uh yeah there are\nThere's a ... of who we know there's about twenty nine twenty seven family's okay that are registered through\nCure jammed that or and all the way you know when we knew of well of ... or not she was with um we've become good friends with two families that will be attending and they're also local and we've seen them and talk to them uh but you know we're looking to gather all the families and the local area\nPeople that just want to come support people that just want to have a good time um it'll be indoors being that it's super hot outside [laughter] and with this disease uh interesting enough\nThese kids can't be out in the sun the sun is a big drinker so we really wanted to make a special event ... this was his first year having this disease he can't be outside at the pool parties he can't be outside between ten and one oh yeah with ... and it is outside it's a ton of sunscreen mhm\nOh gosh so does this side effect but like you said about the ... the ... ...\nThey've sort of like warts or something on your body does it affect the sun effect that\nIt's a trigger it as a trigger it can make the disease flare so the sun could cause the rash than the rash could cause\nThe enzymes that start breaking down your muscles\nSo these kids are always just had to tell you the\nKind of close to ... we learned about all the different you because you could buy and then you know we need sunscreen is very high and zinc oxide so all these things we have to learn and and just you know he's a little guy he's yeah he wants to be outside running around with his friends and well now\nThat now the question is he able to play with other children is that a problem or\nHe's make great turnaround he's really ... the treatments plan is a great one that our doctor a prescribed and he is moving around he might not have the stamina as other kids but he's running around he's having a good time you know it's almost as sometimes we\nAre a little lax on you know the hand sanitizer all that stuff but I'm not that we should be but you know what happened them yeah you know we're we're having a good times the family even went away on\nVacation so okay so yeah you were able to go on vacation\nYeah we don't keep it in him in a bubble by any means um the uh we wanted to have as normal a life as possible it's just it's just our normal you know a little bit of a new normal um the uh\nThe disease was you know it's very tough on him and he but he has been really resilient yeah and he's been great it's just a really social guy um and he's you know found other activities that are a little less physical for the last\nIt was on the gloves videogames loves music dance parties at home you
