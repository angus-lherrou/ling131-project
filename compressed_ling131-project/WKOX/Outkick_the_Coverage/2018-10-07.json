Know\n\nBeach and that\n[laughter]\n... well that's you know we all know about\nKnowledge of yes I was looking man\nSo they can you hold medal\nLena until they fought against\n... for me I\nDon't know the army I\nThink\nWell the short answer is yes um we were able to help hundreds of non profit that focus on you know you development through score um or offer um participation in athletics or sports teams across New England and that\nWe do that through our charitable giving arm and so while we might not be able to send the coaches baseball field to help coach their teams are\nUm you know can equip per se every single team that's out there I'm In New England we do our best to make either monetary contributions um or other kind of tangible contributions to teams to ensure that young people sports programs nonprofits note that were invested in their success\nAnd invested and ensuring that young people had access to the participation in sports\nOkay well sounds like you've been really involved in how long have you been involved in all of this\nWell I've been at the red Sox foundations of January second of this year some owners are going on you know this\nMy tenth month so I'm I'm Still fairly now I'm Still learning um every single day\nBut I I I saw some place in the material that I was reading that\nAh you were involved or you get support it um the owner John Henry and Larry let's genie is that's the name his name\nYou know yeah now you were involved with them\nWhile I'm there you know owners of the team and I I I'm as I run the\nFoundation there you know sensibly my bosses to some extent um however we have a formal board of directors to whom I report as well and so the the chairman of my\nBoard is Tom Warner who is another owner of the team um and then it slid the Henry John's wife on my board as well um amongst a a handful of other folks\nThat are inclusive of other owners and the other\nUh you know community um activists and leaders and ...\nOh okay All right I think this is a good place for us to take a break and tell our listeners are tuned to minority counterpoint and we are talking with I'm going to try to say her name\nNow we're talking with Becca so ... how do I do author yep so often don't want to honor [laughter]\nWe are talking with her she is the executive director of the red Sox foundation and she's telling us what this is all about and so we're going to take a break and come right back and talk more with her so stay tuned and we'll be right back\nQuite a lot of the mosque buddy broom ball welcome back to minority counterpoint this morning our gas has been very much involved in sports groups in fact it sounds like that's probably all she's been doing and not only that\nShe played soccer herself so she is an interesting just tear and a backup tell tell us what to do did you play soccer where and when\nYeah so I was born in Cambridge um and I started playing Cambridge soccer when I was five years old and never stopped until I got the call it and my freshman\nYear in college next car my ACL on and so I had to sit out my freshman year of Brown University which is where I went and play on it but I played my final three years their sophomore junior and senior year and after I graduated I was able to play a couple of years the semi pro soccer\nAnd ultimately ended up playing for the Boston Breakers professionally in two thousand and three and so um it was a dream come true to play for the breakers I always wanted to play at the highest level so I did that for a year\nUntil the league actually folded so it was a really really sad day when we're informed biology and the um the league was folding and so all of my teammates and I had to basically find another job which for me ended up being a good thing because it um\nWas the first step for me to work in the east development and work in nonprofit specifically nonprofits that tried to combine academics with athletics as a um a recipe for success for young people and so that was just a thousand and three and my first job really in\nA non profit work so it was I said a bad day but also a great day um because I you know started down a career path that I ended up um ultimately loving\nOh okay so now talking about the five cornerstone I think I read cornerstone programs as well as the non\nProfit organizations in New England and um I think is it an Florida yes\nWe're unique in that we have to general markets um New England based on where the Fenway Park is and yeah you know our our market here but then also southwest Florida specifically Fort Myers as ... where are our training facility is so as of\nLate winter early spring all of our players had on down to Florida for\nThe weather and play out of um of a ... that we have down there and so we are committed to that community as well in terms of making some philanthropic\nDonations to nonprofits um but as far as you know we try to talk about the work that we do um more along the lines of programs and partnership\nAnd so right now we have two distinct programs Red Sox scholars RBI in three to stink partnerships so that\nWould be with the Jimmy fund the Dana Farber home base and that didn't make center and so those three ... partners and those two programs really received the majority of our um staffed\nCassidy are funding um at our resources given up there at the again partners in programs that we feel are making some of the greatest impact across New England at southwest Florida\nWow so so you're really pretty active in this and what about funding for these programs\nYes great question and so\nYou know one of the things that we do is is host and execute close to ten major fundraisers a year in terms of of that we put on various event like our Fenway Park marathon or\nSomething called picnic in the park where families and friends that red the red Sox anybody really come and pay to just spend the evening and the field\nOr or free barbecue um you know from some alive music and really spent a day with your family just having a good good old time and in some way park um and we have a a gala as well and so we put on a host of fundraisers that generate close to seven million dollars a year that out\nHow much a lot of near what did you say how much does it\nUp close to seven billion dollars\nIn mhm I mean we\nYou know tremendous um but we do host the ... year to get to that amount and so all that funding um\nYou know a lot of it is goes back out to our programs and partnerships that I just mentioned um and that a lot of it also goes out making small grant\nYou deserve a nonprofit in southwest Florida and I'm doing good and so the events that we put on raise the majority of our funding but we also have a whole fundraising staff that are dedicated to writing grant and getting a lot of money in from the grant proposals that we see that throughout the year\nAs well as we have um a major gifts effort so we have folks that work with individuals that would like to make a a significant contribution to our programming handled our partners\nOn and then we have a you know we're very unique to have some sponsorship opportunity so the Boston Red Sox have a whole host of incredible sponsors that sponsored the teams and oftentimes they might call me and say Becca\nUm you know so and so Samuel Adams for example um by you know wants to get involved the drop of green and the unity let's talk about ways that we can form a partnership with the red Sox nation and so we are fortunate to be able to have some corporate sponsors supporting the foundation as well\nSo do any of the funds that I you know I guess I have to I have to go back to veterans do any of the funds that\nYou raise support veteran organizations or anything [laughter] yes\nSo of course the majority of our funding for veterans goes directly to home base because that's one of the art program but we do um you know allocate a lot of the money that we have or those grants but I was talking about yes all\nThrough charitable giving support organizations that are focused on supporting veterans because they're one of our main focus areas of support um our veterans so we're very aware and conscious are making a continued on donations to organizations that specifically support that turns into England\nThat's wonderful and I I did a couple of years ago I guess it was now I did have um the home base\nWent oh yeah I had them on my program yeah oh great yeah yeah so I Try to win ever there are specific programs that\nTo maybe get\nThe way that I\nIn\nOne\nYoung you know they had any kind of like none of them on it and I know\nAnd on the deal is done in my mind when\nWant to know\nHow to live in\nAnd they wouldn't be I\n\nIn the Senate and only a\n... the mosque da da da da\n\nThey have to admit that it's not going to go back to\n\n\nMe either\nBoom\nThey do ... they're going\nGet that you just really a\nMe\n\nNeither\nThe long\nGod\nI\n\nJust grew John ... ... ... ... ...\nNo no no\nI did too ... too soon\nKnow\nShe did would oh man do you\nKnow these guys are you know you know [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay you'll see I got it but so where do you go\nInto a that'll come\nBy by by by by you know wherever\n\nNo no no no no no no not at all you got them all in one\nNoble technique that he ain't no doubt about\nMind but I got up dug out pull my down on\nThe bus or the bottom\nAble to do\n\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n\nWe're done is doing well you know the\nGlobal well not not only get it done in London and the men da da da da da da",
