[laughter] we are talking with her she is the\nExecutive director of the red Sox foundation and she's telling us what this is all about and so we're going to take a break and come right back and talk more with her so stay tuned and we'll be right back\nQuite a lot of people have seen my buddy allowed broom ball welcome back to minority counterpoint this morning our guest has been very much involved in sports groups in fact it sounds like that's probably all she's been doing and not only that\nShe played soccer herself so\nShe is an interesting yes here and a\nBackup tell tell us what to do did you play soccer where and when\nYeah so I was born in Cambridge um and I started playing Cambridge soccer when I was five years old and it's never stop until I got to college and my freshman year in college next car my ACL on and so I had to sit out my freshman year of Brown University which is where I went and play\nUh but I played my final three years their sophomore junior and senior year and after gradually getting I was able to play a couple of years the semi pro soccer\nAnd ultimately ended up playing for the Boston Breakers professionally in two thousand and three and so um it was a dream come true to play for the breakers I always wanted to play at the highest level so I did that for a year\nUntil the league actually hold it so it was a really really sad day when we're informed biology and the um the league was folding and so all of my teammates and I had to\nBasically find another job which for me ended up being a good thing because it\nUm was the first step for me to work in these development and work in non profit specifically nonprofits that tried to combine academics with athletics as a um a recipe for success for young people and so that was just a thousand and three and my first\nJob really in a non profit work so it was I said a bad day but also a great day um because I you know started down a career path that I ended up um ultimately loving\nOh okay so now talking about the five cornerstone I think I read cornerstone programs as well as the non profit organizations in New England and um I think it said an Florida\nYeah so we're unique in that we have to general market um New England based on where the Fenway Park is and the you know our our market here but then also southwest Florida specifically Fort Myers as ... where are our training facility is so as of\nLate winter early spring all of our players had on down to Florida for\nThe weather and play out of um a facility that we have down there and so\nWe are committed to that community as well in terms of making some philanthropic donations to nonprofit um but as far as you know we try to talk about the work that we do um more along the lines of programs and partnership and so right now we have two distinct\nPrograms Red Sox scholars and RBI ... stink partnerships so that\nWould be with the Jimmy fund at Dana Farber home base and that didn't make center\nAnd so those three ... partners and those two programs really received the majority of our um staff capacity are funding um at our resources given up there at the again partners in programs that we feel are making some of the greatest impact across New England at southwest Florida\nWow so so you're really pretty active in to this and what about funding for these programs\nYes great question and so\nYou know one of the things that we do is is host and execute close to ten major fundraisers a year in terms of of that we put on various event like our Fenway Park marathon or\nSomething called picnic in the park where families and friends that red the red Sox anybody really come and pay to just spend the evening and the outfield a are free barbecue um\nYou know from some alive music and really spent a day with your family just having a good good old time and in Fenway Park um and we have a a gala as well and so we put on a host of fundraisers that generate close to seven million dollars a year that helps\nA lot of near what did you say how much does it\nUp close to seven billion dollars an hour and that bin Laden mhm I mean\nWe you know tremendous um but we do host the ... year to get to that amount\nAnd so all that funding um\nYou know a lot of it is goes back out to our programs\nAnd partnerships that I just mentioned um is that a lot of it also goes out making small grants to deserving nonprofits in southwest Florida and I'm doing good and so the events that we put on raise the majority of our funding but we also have a whole fundraising staff that are dedicated to writing grant\nAnd getting a lot of money and from the grant proposals that we said that throughout the year\nAs well as we have um a major gifts effort so we have folks that work with individuals that would like to make a a significant contribution to our programming and our partners on and then we have a you know we're very unique to have some sponsorship opportunity so the Boston Red Sox\nHave a whole host of incredible sponsors that sponsored the teams and oftentimes\nThey might call me and say Becca\nUm you know so and so Samuel Adams for example um by you know wants to get involved still drop a green and the unity let's talk about ways that we can go on a partnership with the red Sox foundation and so we are fortunate to be able to have some corporate sponsors supporting the foundation as well\nSo do any of the funds that I you know I guess I have to have to go back to veterans do any of the funds that you raise support veteran organizations or anything\n[laughter] yes so of course the majority of our funding for veterans goes directly to home base because that's one of the art program but we do um you know allocate a lot of the money that we have for those grants that I was talking about\nYeah solo do charitable giving support organizations that are focused on supporting veterans because they are one of our main focus areas of support um our veterans so we're very aware and conscious of making a continued on donations to organizations that simply support veterans in New England\nThat's wonderful and I did a couple of years ago I guess it was now I did have um the home base went oh yeah I had them on my program yeah oh great yeah yep so I Try to whenever there are specific programs that these people are doing that\nWell I guess I'm a little ah well I just want to know and I want to know that these different organizations and everything\nAre being funded because yeah there are some that I guess need funding and and I like to make sure that they get the information out so what are some of the other things that we need to know about what it is that you're doing Becca [noise]\nUm well one of the things that were running right now that I Love anybody
