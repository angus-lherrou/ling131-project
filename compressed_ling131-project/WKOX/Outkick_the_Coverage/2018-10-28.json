Emmanuel Baptist church in ... okay and he is originally from uh\nDetroit ... got to meet him Oh absolutely made him yes I I he's also a friend so gotta make sure at some point we in time we get you to me him\nSo I Want to know I'm White House has been going on and what else do you have planned that we need to know that so I listeners can hear about it and you know they come visit to [laughter]\nIt was certainly I'm you know so so this month a has not only included one hundred and forty five years of of St Paul's existence but went past or adults was there and he served the church for thirty one years\nThere were a few things that got started one of the things was a homeless\nAgency or an aid that serves homeless family okay I Know it's called the hill to brand new family health center named after that then bishop Hilderbrand yes and that was a Thirty Years' ago so at the beginning of this month we celebrated Thirty years of the hill the brain\nWhich has spun off and become its own separate entity and it's one of the largest uh agencies in the states that tells us homeless families and I'm I'm blessed sooner but on the board is that as any parents from Saint Paul would [noise]\nUh but we celebrated that with a wonderful reception an honor to pass it adults and and I gave him a wonderful\nI'm a trophy to uh celebrate those those Thirty years um and also to remind folks because we we also housed the Henry button or school yes and Henry Butner was the gentleman in whose home or the early church met before it became a truck\nAnd India.Arie buck nor I learned became the second pastor\nOh St Paul okay\nAmy church and so the Henry bugging her school is also separate entity but it's yeah house in the Christian life center yes on bishop Richard Allen and really even right now focuses is our focus is only a very young children the uh the infants and toddlers in pre K. ah but they're doing a phenomenal job as well\nNow I have to it just came to me\nAh where do ya park\nAlthough there [laughter] there is a parking lot across the street yeah mature yeah Colombia\nAnd we don't own it but we do have access to it on Sunday Morning okay and uh so that's that's the primary plays in Oregon and then from there there's another ... a parking lot or a going from the church toward the ... that's at sixty five bishop Ellen drive\nIt's owned by the city by the city of ... but on Sundays they don't charge so that's a good thing to know so it's free there\nAnd then of course that lives in another city on a lot across from the Christian life center that's also free on Sunday their street parking gets a little challenging gets a lot of construction going on yes but ah you know you you can do it you just\nGet there early or be resourceful and keep looking okay so I Can't park over there in that parking lot is high in St as you say okay you can and we don't have the St Paul signs up oh okay okay\nOkay so they haven't finished construction or whatever they're putting up\nThere that's going to be going on for a little bit and do that too in a way of the city ... that was originally and handle the jury yes uh so that's the one that's been replaced just a little bit down the street a sixty five bishop Ellen drive 'em and this will be going on for a while because even as they move for them in\nThe construction of these these are of a luxury apartments in town homes I guess uh\nCan you even as we move forward with that the city is going to be doing some construction so we really have to live with that for awhile pray pray for your church\nAnd yeah I think they will because you know it was like\nWhat is going on here when they started tearing down and I was ... my husband thing at the time was ill and so we were going back and forth into Boston and I'd go by there and I'm like if they don't they just tearing down this whole place and what is going to happen to St Paul here and I still\nDon't get it is a challenge\nThey sometimes say before it gets better it'll get worse and uh so we're just kind of preparing ourselves for that but we're also continuing to look for other solutions ... working with the city's if we can find other places to park\nYes yeah though that is the main and oh yeah yeah as you can\nImagine because of all the construction the values of property of shot\nOh ...
