I don't think I'll just do what you do\nI guess you could say that some people just sort of ... curl up in a fetal position and just ah you know give up but look you you've you've persisted I read that yesterday's six months ago you had that and I couldn't believe you're you're coming out and you're doing all these things\nYeah God Bless you still listen to book or just by the way more than a loft in Studio Judy Collins' daughter of course she wrote a book a star is born it's just I don't know Judy Garland and the film that got away it's a beautiful picture book all about the movie stars board all of them\nAll four of us all four of them jumping in front of us yeah because you're you're mom's movie was was great so then in Seventy six strikes and Christopher said right with us from you know with Cooper and Lady Gaga following\nDave Chappelle I ... I saw him he spent his grave right it's when you look at it but I\nTell you something the whole movie is fantastic yes I mean they took it into the future and they made it there\nSo I'm Glad you said that because I'm the type of guy like with my kid burning them or to your kids not as good as Mike it I'm Sorry don't take up the wrong guys my kids better but\nFor you to be able to enjoy remakes of your mom's movie and give them credit to fifth wheel maturity and my immature\nNo no no no [laughter] I think that when you have to give credit credit is due and sometimes we don't like it and sometimes you have to give you know it was sometimes the devil is do and sometimes you have to do that but I thought when I went to see I went to the movie with an\nOpen heart and an open mind and they have made it their movie\nThen so it's still the same old story they say in Casablanca but they they've made it their own and I was absolutely just blown away by their performances their generosity towards me and I just loved it and I I encourage everybody to go out and see is the new stars\nAnd how about you were speaking of which the one with Chris christopherson Barbra Streisand does that rate as high as this one yeah\nNot my ... well yeah I I really love this while I'm not far behind I I I Love the fact\nThat there were certain things that they paid homage to ah for the fifty four version like for instance one\nLady Gaga for I'm not going to do a spoiler for you but when she comes out at the very top of the film in the alleyway and she has her to turn you really can't see it's her and she sings eight bars of over the rainbow nice\nAnd then it says a star is going on so they thought that was awesome yeah she's amazing should really lovely what is a great person what\nYour mom was a wizard of Oz of course we still my kids I mean God hundred years from now towards you know there's still going to watch your mom plate or if he's that's that's gotta be incredible my kids' school I'm On the radio it's nothing compared to that but I wouldn't do that obviously ended a ugly right for your mom and she died tragically\nAnd you have to deal with all the time what what what are you really feel about the way your mom died and then other people along the way that you find to be I don't know almost insensitive not necessarily giving her the credit that she deserved when she lived well\nI have to tell you something I don't think her audiences are ever felt anything but love and joy and grateful knows um when you lose a parent at any age it's really hard I was sixteen when I lost my mom wants to ... yeah and ... you know she made\nI'm thirty nine movies and she died at the age of forty seven wow and so it's just extraordinary the the amount of work that she left us with all the recordings from the television shows and all of the film and that\nWe got close we're not very clear very very very she wouldn't leave you for months at a time they'll never never\nNever we were we grew up on the road and and she was the best mother she knew how to be but we are still struggling with addiction today and that's not going to go away for a long time and we are still struggling with the doctors over prescribing medications to people that\nMay have the genetic\nA distinguished a distinguished of of being ... being an addict and that's still going on uh the only thing is is out in the medium so I mean it's not a lot has changed but the thing that has changed or\nWe know about that now and now there are facilities and there are doctors and they are we have the help that people can get\n... my mom didn't have that no so we have the education we have the facilities we have all of that\nAnd you know ... you know that if you're in trouble or right you all you have to do is get on your phone and look at an AA meeting that's what you need to do and it's there so that you can get you can start that journey into sobriety\nSo living through it my mom didn't have any of that though and so that's why I think to myself that's why I'm so\nA passionate about people getting help and realizing that there is something out there for you\n... the the door of Judy Garland gunned them\nSo I can tell you something I I just want you know on a different subject I just you know I was caught up of course you know in in the ... that happened yesterday in the city and I just have to say\nI Want to thank the NYPD I Want to thank the CIA I Want to thank the FBI ... I Want to thank the governor the mayor and everybody who kept a safe yesterday I Am so glad that nothing happened Jimmy O'Neal the police commission\nI Jimmy O'Neill yes I Want to say I mean I was just down at a you know right at Madison Square garden and I I I see the the the I guess they're with their armed police some of them I say thank you to them sure all the time because people just walk by them and they don't realize that they're doing an incredible job\nIt really is and that and by the way speaking of a New York city it was I think the the two men who set the tone for this type of politicization of a day when we should have been United as you stay Bernie Carrick on the Bernie and said Joe\nWhere are the Blasio when Cuomo at a press conference before noon they started pointing fingers at the president before no I mean before anything was really known about this they were saying this is the president's fault it was really disgusting and I think that that's ... picked up by CNN and the rest of the John Brennan roller us\nYou know guys I I just want to clarify one thing because Governor Cuomo made a statement last night and I think he did it yesterday afternoon but he did it I'll walk Blitzer last night\nThis is the first time that our country's history that there's been political terrorism um you know through the through the sending all these devices I I have to tell you especially as of New York governor\nIn the Nineteen sixties seventies and eighties the symbol Jonathan Jackson unit the weather on the ground the black Liberation Army the black panther party were responsible for hundreds of bombings it was a socialist the communist movement hundreds of bombings\nIn other words even even the eBay Ellen to what's going to happen\nAnd the and the F. A. L. and you know the responsible for the assassination the assassination of almost two dozen cops many of which were in New York City cops you know and this guy you know that was extremely political it was a very political time\nYou know they they just turn this entire think they should focus on the investigation focus on bringing people together that's what they should be doing and they're doing everything ...\nAbsolutely right Bernie ... we didn't lose them there but that's exactly what they should be focusing on and said the pope politicized ... out of right out of the box is discussing number and if you still there\nI Want to ask you about the the way down to come back yeah about ... I Want to ask him about specifically the investigation itself how long he thinks it will take given the trail that the that we have here I mean it's so many venues the packages were sent to\nNow is the third consecutive day it started Monday with ... who is day was all over New York city in Miami now this morning try back to Robert De Niro so you've got three consecutive days seven eight nine devices it seems to us and went on a piano tops teams to watch this may even be an easy run you\nKnow you would think right you would think it wasn't just one like you say too I mean there was so many episodes so many different places with all the videotape and they'll be innate testing out there and burning a back with us Bernie character started we last year Bernie\nBut speaking of the investigation or again with a ... a package is that there's so many different places Bernie this should it seems to me the FBI should be able to solve this relatively quickly am I wrong\nNo you're you're absolutely right I talked about this yesterday morning I'm with this many devices with this much activity with the technology we have today I said yesterday morning\nWe probably have somebody in handcuffs within twenty four to Seventy two hours and um I I find it really hard to believe that\nThe bureau look this is what they do you know forget the guys at the top that it's you know been on this political activism thing the men and women and the joint terrorism task forces\nWith the local partners like the you know the New York city detectives this New York state police my son is Newark detective assigned to the FBI are just sports in Newark these guys go out and do the stuff every day they're\nReally really good at their job and I bet they have somebody in custody within two\nDays well I'm going to ask you this I've been on CNN a couple of times myself on ... just last year Bernie\nI'm but I really thought of all the folks that came out yesterday and spoke Clinton brand name Cuomo was the ... the biggest hypocritical was jumped sucker he programs his network to bash Trump twenty four hours a day seven days a week and he's talking about Trump's rhetoric you talk about a hypocrite so I've been\nI haven't been reaching out let's say the CNN to try to get back to what you experienced and saw yesterday and the way you were pretty much disrespected by cutting you off so John Brennan to go on it's nonsensical rant will you Bernie Carrick boycott anymore appearances\nCNN the I'm not going back until they change wow I I ... I ... I Can't do it I mean this is you know it's because you weren't back signs that political times\nAnd we have enough problems with the leadership in this country the political leadership you know the press is dry as the press is Dr ... last night was a prime example it was the hypocrisy\nWhat everybody up what they what they complain about on a daily basis you know they didn't mention Maxine Waters telling people to go out and getting people's faces they didn't mention Eric Holder telling people to get violent they didn't mention that skull east was gunned\nDown on a ball field um you know they didn't mention any of that stuff that they're talking about the president stop already it's just way too political\nAnd they didn't mention of course the violence that you've seen in Minneapolis with a with several ... by the candidates running for office that will Republicans who are the victims of violence\nThe violent or antifa riots out in Portland they didn't report on that at all and all of his stuff Corey Grover none of it that they ignore all that and now all of a sudden\nIt's clubs rhetoric is set to encourage the all the violin lessons\nWhen we looked at one burning do we know with this point whether these devices a percentage of them all of them none of them actually had the ability to detonate do do we know any of that specific information\nHonestly we do not know that I have to believe that there's some legitimate mechanism in the in the devices the FBI's had the first to budge since Monday\nSo they have to know whether there's a whether there is a real explosive or not um that has come to light a so you know right now just everybody speculating just give it time let the investigators do their job and uh and we'll find out and do time\nThat's it that said the ... as well said Bernie character in a job well done yesterday walking out of CNN burning character we love you hear on the Bernie Mac show we thank you for ... vote you do\n[laughter]\nSeventy seven WABC [noise]\nSeven W crawfish\nOh he's still doing north found on the Brooklyn queens expressway from the rickety knock on traffic center\nI'm ... north not flushing eminent overturn Trump left and center lanes are going to be out of service there might be some river and that can use your head south to be aware of that and then two problems on the ... on the west side and they were thirty seven police activity two lanes are out now and then construction right an extra twenty nine again both of those things\nCausing problems on the LIE in Nassau County and then in the eastern part of queens spring for South down one hundred and eighty an accident an alternate side again today is in effect from the wreckage unit dot com traffic center I'm Joan on Seventy seven WABC here's channel seven's bill Evans weather forecasts\nGoing to give him on the coastal flood watch is in central time all high tide is we've got a nasty\nStories coming our way today was nervous sunshine clouds you sort of sticking more later on in Sanford and were fifty one flight is increasingly windy rain over spreads the area after\nMidnight as midnight and the windows of rain there is nothing by about four AM tomorrow is very heavy rain some when you wake up from heavy rain\nSunrise Ruben day in the afternoon the temperatures going to be fifty four degrees very heavy rain up to two to three inches of rain when does the forty five miles down in the city of declined because coastal flooding at a time of heights fired through the day tomorrow tomorrow even rain goes away the storm\nPools are way to lose when he died Sunday breezy not as Julie clouds since you suddenly breaks the high is going to be fifty six next week the average is still in the fifties and well below normal ... year is one of them are just run through my injuries on using DNA just wear loose wanting to fifty pounds and only forty days now with a new office in white plains New York is eight five five engine die as\nA lawyer was injured by God this has just\nIt was seven WABC where New York I was doing\nSome writing stuff on your shopping cart stop crying they're\nTrying to steal licks from your mom or\nDid not playing\nIt safe a they see me you are scrambling soft strenuous winning starts [laughter]\nTime we have an issue for\nMissouri oh three PM and six oh three P.
