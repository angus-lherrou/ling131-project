like a well I don't know if it's exactly what we're talking about but it's close by perhaps uh the the puzzle was almost so it was it was the same name so so what what they do is let's say it's um\nCar right they'll say they'll say a big car and little car so you have to figure out the two words leading up to ... for example you know what I'm saying no I'm doing a\nCarnival you involved so it'd be like a big blank and and the next one is wash so it will be the worm missing where it is\nOkay how about this big car in car watching I don't even know his his uh his about I don't\nKnow if the word machine machine right it could be a but it could be a dish washing\nAnd rage against [laughter] that's right exactly for example and then you go then that would be machine and so that's the that's the ... the same name clue me in this case it we shower shower shower okay so we have the words were up to the words\nBridal okay and and then the next word the first letters missing and it's O

that that was a very funny moment I and they should have addressed that I don't know if they did at the very end when a when they have that little exchange between the pet and van or they should have said something about it right but I'd probably uh I Would guess that they did of course they didn't however\nYou remember back South Park did ... actually uh the funny thing I Do the\nAnswer was
