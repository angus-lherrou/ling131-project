David Duke has a lot of followers he ran into the Senate or governor of a Louisiana you had some falling and there are two or three Republicans now running\nWithout the support of the party or anti Semite or Holocaust deniers they're not going to win the difference is that\nThere are some Democrats who wins who have associations at least ... Islamic anti Semitism African American anti Semitism and other forms of how would rate it anti Semitic or if you're a may nor the feeling is you're a little bit of immune from it back\nIf you're an anti Semite\nHow could you explain what my friend who I voted for and supported Bill Clinton sitting on the platform bitter cause he he would never sit on the platform David\nDuke or even if it was at a funeral well there is a double standard that yeah but it was\nBut you see that and again we're talking to fame defense attorney Alan Dershowitz on the Joseph Abboud VIP just slide a double standard is fine but when you're talking about somebody that actually expresses that type of hatred towards a people\nI Need you to answer that question yourself you're friends with the guy how does Bill Clinton sit there and how does the rock Obama do that they're not stupid men I don't believe either one of them is an evil man they know full well what ... can preaches every single day so you went to that question how do they do it why for what\n[noise] well I think first of all they know that there were some good people is is to paraphrase\nParaphrase President Trump there are some good people naive ridiculous maybe maybe not very smart who support for conflict if they think he does good things for the African American community but what are people on ... on the right has done good things\nFor their people as well and yet\nNone of us would tolerate fascism on the right we have to have the same standards for anti Semitism on the west\nNow to her credit witness or short condemned the killing but nonetheless that's you know that's on friday ... acts on Saturday and Sunday but on Monday and Tuesday when the shore joins with Islamic extremists\nWho espouse anti Semitism\nAnd you can't have it both ways you can you know cry and support the Jewish community when they're victimized and then go back and support those who were victimized south ah it's it's ... and yet it's\nTolerated by extremes on both sides look the important thing is as soon as something like this happens to the first impulsive politicians is to use it to the airport is an advantage both right and left\nYou can't do that you have to can damage universally you have to not think about partisan advantage but you have to think about how to stop this in the future anti Semitic attacks\nAre increasing all over the world not just in the United states but in France in Sweden in many many parts of the world and they reflect a a a phenomenon that goes back\nHundreds and hundreds of years and uh in some countries are the condemnation from the top ... unequivocal in other countries it's been less less than ...\nAnd of course Alan Dershowitz and the burning to George W NBC I mentioned uh what what you're talking about the effort mentioned a Maxine Waters and all of them but there are others that are pop culture people who have been calling for violence and the various politicians as well you've heard of ... Eric Holder a senator Cory growing for the rest of them\nBut yet the the mainstream media for the most part they're trying to blame all this violence on the president the Washington Post with some really you're a Republican headlines out there what his own words make all that well\nAgain seeking partisan advantage the president had nothing to do with this this guy would have done when he did no matter who the president was it goes back deep in his a psyche\nOr you know the idea of trying to find a scapegoat uh on on the right or for the right trying to find a particular scapegoat on the left it's a pervasive problem in the world today and we have to address it as a country I'm an attack on\nA synagogue and Pittsburgh is an attack on all Americans just like a tax on black churches were attacks on all Americans and we have to unite around condemnation and prevention rather than try to\nFocus on immediate part is an advantage on either side in game through something like that\nI um I personally don't believe on when we can stop things like these I think it's very simple for anybody even if the armed guards outside you can dress up put on ... and walking as if he was a an everyday you know show member and then just open fire and so\nI mean it happens that has happened in Israel right right exactly terrorists dress up as Scott season designs writing blow\nThemselves up and uh you know it's it's a terrible terrible thing look\nBut the way the wind you really can't stop it so I Know resemble down where I used to live in Boca Raton island they've got going to do like an armed guards outside every show my my my kids went to the Jaycee seats there are going out there too but\nI'm like look I was wrong here [laughter] but that doesn't mean that the left is incapable of this and or worse I e shooting on a baseball field now do you know that I had a ton of people\nIncluding the craziest person\nIn my life today is somebody that I Love ... Arnold my father was my father is nuts and I love ... leads a conspiracy oh my God so even though I'm On Twitter and Facebook going All right I was wrong here\nThis time I was ... my father seismic tests he goes oh soda\nSmells fishy\nSomething doesn't add up here you know ... and and by the way after he sent me that actually I Swear to you buddy I got about twenty five tweets saying the same thing from people on the right\nThat still refuse to believe that some Trump loving guy can do this they still believe a\n... year\nWhat's fishy guy in Texas on his ... and and plus he did the same thing for all he did in two thousand to a an extensive criminal record yeah he was just in that job they video of this guy at nine thousand Trump rallies\nHolding up signs I mean believe me I Wish I was right but at some point you got it for all of the dead loves his um his ... he doesn't want to send to look that no he does he loves me a lot as much as he died whatever all of us on but he loves Trump\nThen he loves the Republicans and he hates the left\nAnd he said he wanted you to be right so bad so badly that he was like this that does that way the white flag just yet he's still not\nThey sent me something about George Soros I Swear to God I I just delete it I'm like that I Love you but ... but you know the good thank God he sent me a text about the giants that's the\nInteresting what Bill Bill O'Reilly said about ... yeah if you if you attack sorrows\nYou're an anti Semite because he is like a derivative of some Hungarian Jews meanwhile this guy just like I said to bill he supports the boycott Israel movement he he he finds yeah the boy cat Israel he hates the state of Israel\nHe's a Ron Coby type or a Jew that's right ... you're exactly right and yet if you ... if you just criticizing they they they they whip out this card this this this race\nCard is Jewish court or whatever the hell it is\nI mean it's so transparent and sickening in tiring and uh we were just sick of it just tired of all the the cards that you whip out\nThe guy's a piece of crap and that that's the bottom line Michael good when he's my former tennis partner talk on the at the Josef Abboud tournament that's right I've played with a dog again Patrick Munro and Patrick McEnroe and just vote John Michael Goodwin did write\nThat he does not believe that either and again we hate to politicize these days but that's what we do he does not believe that these\nSham of a of a a device guy or and or what was a real tragedy what happened in Pittsburgh on Saturday he doesn't believe that either one of those events will change\nThe midterms coming up on Tuesday you saw that he doesn't say hold on drugs you agree with that but I read the column yeah okay he he uh do I agree with it\nI I don't know ... you know in this ah\nNews cycle things change so quickly I mean we went from Brett Kavanaugh to God Knows wash in about three or four days to cover the all the ... account of animals you have the caravan over I we went to the Caribbean right of the bread cabinet and then you have the vice guy\nYes I mean it's just everything changes so quickly but ah I think everybody has now been energized galvanize or by by the by events that\nBoth sides are going to turn out which bodes well for the party\nIn the White House because usually the party in the White House is the party that doesn't turn out for these midterm elections but now they're going to turn they need to and that that again bodes well for the Republican I Love Chris Matthews he sounded like such an idiot on friday night I'm Sorry\nAnd he sits there all these asshole from my Mother Jones and all these hateful website have with corn yes he was there I mean I I Know he's ... and so what's funny is the rational\nOutlets\nWill call and these things devices even friday night he's arrested we've got the mole twelve or Thirteen fourteen whatever it is nobody loses a fingernail\nThey're calling them devices what two networks still talked about bombs what two networks will give you one guess well you can give me two cables cable now of course\nIt's going to be is CNN and MSNBC lying even friday night banks he read they see what I did very\nThank you Mike Breen still calling of bombs on the other networks are calling them devices because by the way even as late as friday night I'm not even sure this morning we still know that any of these have the capability of detonating do we know\nWe don't know uh but uh I mean they have glass shards wind up and they\nHad they had males they had all the things like the boss they're arming did but but I don't detonate who cares what's inside of they have\nThe capability of exploding\nWe don't know it's a good question so but so then how do you call it a bomb could have been a fake gun anything and and again you're going to tell me this guy you know this much hatred and didn't blow one of them I I'll tell you what\nYou even though we like them you know knows about bombs Chris Matthews he bombs every night [laughter] doesn't rain every single night\nHe's always ... last the last in the cable news was he got killed always always I mean
