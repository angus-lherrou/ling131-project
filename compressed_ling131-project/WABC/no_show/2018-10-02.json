more than ... more [noise] sound like you had some ... some of my mind [laughter] I Know what the rules [laughter]\nYou know to avoid as the bill\nI'm In essence if some of\nThem also Seventy so your ABC\nSomeone someone you know what I can tell you how many nights and therefore I watch Monday Night football I always watch Errol Louis well with Mayor Bill de Blasio first of all this is a Jewish holidays and not\nFocus is over I think no sucker it was it was over the weekend circus yeah so coat\nOkay so the so anyway um so you know the the like these little you see like these little a homemade a test it looked like a tent or a trailer right then you eat dinner and they asked ... now you know what you're talking about that they call those things uh soccer\nAs well yeah it was a holiday is still coat and that's called a ... right exactly that's ...\nYeah [laughter] but I Am right now\nIt's all over [noise] yeah that's funny that's funny right there hey so anyway on the Upper East side near Gracie Mansion they had one of those suckers suckers and uh somebody or somebody spray painted\nSome stuff on it every year to see you know the temples Upper East side Riverdale and and the suckers they vandalized those things every year but yeah what what's what's so significant about this case\nThey they they what they wrote on it was free guys for you guys give me a break so they had New York one talking about the vandalism just vandalism against the the sucker you know and the Jewish people were outraged\nAnd then they also that were reporter went on to say that uh it was interpreted by many as anti Semitism mhm instead of labeling that they see they were reluctant to label that anti Semitism themselves\nBut as we know the new anti Semitism is hating on Israel is boycott Israel aid on Israel blah blah blah rice so New York New York one doesn't think so they they think that that it was just a political statement that it's even Steven\nOh stop it they actually said that actually said\nThat that's your bowl of New York one and then again the idea of the local news Long Island who else had it though who said it\nIt was I I didn't write down the name of the reporters I mean we could do something if we look it up we could even get the tape but what are you saying that that is that is how the whole station feels or this reporter did this story and it was both the anchor and the report really they called it\nA vandalism and then the reporter went on lay the ... the agriculture vandalism reporter later went on to say\nIt was interpreted by many as anti Semitism ... now and there but at the ... and then there were ... they did mention that the hate crimes unit is looking into it but they themselves would not call it anti Semitic as you know the whole the whole ethical state now did you say it\nTo think about this for a second and I do watch that channel all day every day couldn't weekends I don't know if I Know even one Jewish host on that station I don't know\nI see some old lady at night I see the guy Louis de oddly with the bad teeth\nOr at night I ... a bunch of other there'd be called him a gallon deliberate ... a guy in the morning used to work here in fact that you're in the ... right right I I don't I don't remember any ... even the tropical some of her body by the way I don't I don't remember I don't know if one Jewish person works there how's he said that ...\nDo you follow what I'm saying is a fencing some this is the lawyer new anti ... and it's being tolerated being sort of\nNormalize if you will because again it's a political state right right and so you had also uh over the weekend you saw the this girl that that goes to Columbia University and the New York post yes she's the daughter of a an Israeli ambassador\nShe's getting the Columbia won't protect her from the the anti Semitic or\nAnimals of course not on campus Ivy League terrible ... system terrible look this is all okay this is nothing new I Know we have to point that out every single time just to emphasize\nHow bad it is but this is nothing new but even worse well by a Jewish friends are born on Twenty years ago we went through this the New York one again is helping to normalize the sentiment is a ... and then channel eleven where our friend Scott Stanford works I don't know if they probably did this inadvertently that they didn't realize\nWell listen we know role mine is a better defensive catch it but the the last couple of days Sanchez is looked like the Sanchez of all I got to tell you something guys\nGunter head when he's right I think he's the best hitter on the team the best hitter\nOverall hit or on the team having said that though is that his problems but you want to know what\nIf you need runs being scored\nHe's the guy I my my biggest concern is the pitching\n... you know pitching wins in the postseason uh sit you know that we've we've discussed the time and time again my biggest problem we've been going back since spring training talking about the Yankees my biggest fear was starting pitching well now they're starting pitching has to show up Wednesday otherwise they're not going to be any tomorrow\nNo there's no doubt but but it is worth talking about the up and you know we\nFeel like we spent so much time talking about Aaron Boone and everything that went wrong with the Yankees but then a season where they launched judge their best player for a long time they lost duty they lost Sanchez they lost pitchers they've lost Chapman steam on a hundred games is she a rush a hundred\nThey broke every up in some categories they broke the all time home run record set for the Ninety seven mariners me go and do are actually broke showed the ma she owes record for doubles as a rookie so you look back with all the nonsense and all the talk\nAnd they may lose on Wednesday it's one of them are white season for the next\n... no question about it and everybody got very excited and probably you know understandably so but because they came within one game of go to the world series last season you know how it is especially in New York okay they're ready to win at All right away this year and list that\nThey ... they didn't have one rookie they had two rookies and they're starting\nLineup tourists and and the heart and tourists was the guy was getting all the aid\nAnd by the way it was the guy who go home on that actually do\nI buy you're right you're right but to me what an too hard on I mean as far as I'm concerned hands down he has to be the American league rookie of the year and and his\nHis home runs and his doubles not only what what what the numbers impressive but he it seems like every one of them was in a court situation like that's the big thing for a kid to be able to do that\nIs huge rush Salzburg on the burning said show but the but the two are a citizen I just sit in my discussion earlier\nThe fact that they're ... they're going to be one game away from the real playoffs I mean and and they were expected to go all the way the world series if they lose in this or this particular ... game would that be considered a disappointment\nOh and our question is going to be a disappointment now that\nThere's a difference between a Bernie calling it a disappointment and failure right I find that hard to believe you know as\nI said before they want a hundred damn game you you you can't say you were a failure it it it will be a an immense disappointments we're all parties concern but a\nFailure listen you know like like what happens if two guys like two hundred a ... you know you get to the world series and the two best records\nIn each league a and one guy loses but it's it's not a failure\nI we we have a tough time in my point for some reason we like on the team\nIf the Yankees lose on Wednesday shortly disappointing but you know you've got to do you got a tip your cat to the red Sox they won a hundred and seven games this year has nothing to do with the Yankees the Yankees out a great year great here but you gotta tip your top to the red Sox let's move to the giants you were there yesterday\nI don't want to hear about all dumped back in June you're not at fault I've watched it was open a couple of times the line from\nI don't hear about Barkley I don't know about the offensive line and you don't even want manning the giants have not caught thirty points now\nFor thirty six straight games thinking about that guy that's nearly three years with a giant ... has not been able to score thirty points\nAnd we always say this one has been the one constant for the giants who's always been a ton of last year for a couple of games the guy behind center it's Eli Manning so you could take your two Super Bowls you'll fifty thousand yards your three hundred touchdowns you'll never noble hoping they take all of that\nI Am telling you the biggest problem for the giants and it has been for years it's a God damn quarterback [laughter]\nGeez talk about this in a failure you're ready to roll I a lot\nLess than that I get it and it has been disappointing but when he was twenty five for twenty nine last week but two Ninety seven to ... days everybody what\nWhat has gone up is that one could have the bottom of it was just so we want to a game of three bad change\nWell hold on a second I I'm not saying he sat good games quite frankly the team is had three lousy games and one good game which was last week I mean yesterday was kind of shocking to me because they started out they go ahead\nOn their first possession methodically moved the ball down the field that score a touchdown I'm not saying that myself listening on on your show yesterday on this one Sunday what would we talking about we were talking about if\nYou're going to eat this age you got to be the sustained drives the best way to do the best way to beat the St Pete\nBruce Drew Brees off the field I mean for crying out loud you're talking about the NFL's all time completion\nLeader he he he completed eight passes yesterday that's not bad their defense\nPlayed very well that means burning made a comment before about um sake one getting touches I agree with\nThat he only got ten ten or a past ten\nOr ... he had ten Russia's ties but he also he also had six reception so the the the point is I don't care if it's ladder roles\nForward passes or a ... had lost just getting them to gamble All right that's what I'm saying what part of the problem is that it's still the offensive line which is um oh they're little improve from the first couple of weeks yet\nBut there is a long way to go from\nOthers we got to run I agree but I still like I I think Eli Manning is too comfortable with a drink in the dumps doesn't look to get the ball down appeal for me he's a major issue a great job is always excellent job talk to you again throughout the week the OJ podcast\nOur bodies thank you\n[laughter]\nSeventy seven and a B C
