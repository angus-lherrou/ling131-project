I think the fair credit for it but for the truck right now because we don't know who did this and we don't know what motivated him to do it ... the ... the fair criticism of President Trump right that would be but it doesn't\nEd or whether you're culpability or not you're the president United States your job to calm the waters your job is to is to try to camp things down 'cause you're the you're you're the president of all people right now that is to present a Republican cetera so\nBut you did I I think that you've got to split the difference here if you're going to criticize the president I thought it would have plenty initially right now it's his job right now at this job the unite the country right now it's his job not well I ... you know listen I think those of you who should have done I think you could have done a few more than minimum say\nLook let me make it personal for you all kinds of all let me make a personal for you\nWhen Sean Hannity you talk to you you go back at him\nDonald Trump wakes up one morning when we should all be United on before you can even talk about they saying he's got the mayor of New York blaming him\nThe governor of New York's blaming him a guy in just ... who wants to programmed his station from the minute Donald Trump won his network has blasted Donald Trump's way before Donald Trump fired back\nHe's got to listen all day every media outlet your friend Chris Matthews\nWait till I'm Out of the justice showing him and this idea that he should just suck it up and be a leader is shown nonsensical you couldn't do it\nI couldn't do it quite frankly I'm not I don't\nListen to say wait a little I think I I I I said I sort of take issue in this respect\nNobody thing you should never response there are moments though where you have to take the high road there are moments where these bigger\nBut it's first like they'd be that's the bigger I don't disagree with you I think there's some people that have jumped the gun because it's too late for the election and they want\nTo make people think are worse than the president okay they're doing it for political gain I I it's a hundred percent true there's no doubt in my mind that that's motivation there that still does it mean he's not pressing the United states\nI look I got I got a I've got a family that like sitting there going what packages should we opened in front of the battle but I think that ... I don't know I mean I I'm not you know so there are people that are rattle that are angry left or right there are people that are simply rattle\nSo I what I'm saying is I ... I think you're not wrong about the hyperventilating by some part is\nBut I guess at the end of the day the president and I have to take more than most people are this is where we may disagree and I think maybe even the president I disagree on this is that I think that you have\nTo take more arrows than the average human being that's just that comes with the job and you sometimes you have to suck it up more I I always look at why I was critical of Obama when he would reach out to Congress bottled come after me to what you mean they don't reach out to me and I'm like you're president eighty percent of the job of reaching out to the president's job\nRight you're president of all the people that the philosophical disagreement which I think we can debate I don't disagree with I think some of the outrageous high hyperbolic jumping after him without waiting for the yeah\nYeah that's right and and again that the montage that we open the segment ... there there there were all media people and even though the CNN reporters they weren't outside after they got to back away from a CNN headquarters\nThey were having more fun they will get even Anderson Cooper an MD Cohen on New Year's eve blaming you're the president ... what we got um no we don't have to cover the stupid ... and I mean they would do this\nIs what you're saying this is what it's funny you bring that up I have felt that left and right\nThat people are just upset that the story changed right or vice versa that you know last week it was a trip literature which covers who care then right on the left or this ... you know it's like a high degree like everybody is I mean this is what this is why I think we we\nEverybody should agree that we shouldn't jump to a conclusion on who did this because again if you're a foreign power\nTrying to disrupt us or whatever the hell of a job on around um which tells me that a foreign government or foreign entity who has been messing around with our politics could easily be turning Africa\nWell that's possible I got to tell you when I heard you say that I I'm not going to lie I was like not is very very plausible Alaska official two weeks away from them in terms\nOf again I'm I'm not a huge you know this is talk I'm not a huge from tight but I have to admit that the one side the left has been more over the top done the right so my question to you is what it tells you\nWhere you say for what it's worth I think it depends\nWhere everybody they apply to all of my left vague elastic the exact same thing\nI don't ... listen I allow my here the politicians on the less I hear the Maxine Waters on the recall ... basically asking for violence I don't I don't remember people going up to Bernie Sanders when ... got shot and a baseball field I don't care what the things my question to you is two weeks away from the midterms\nWho's more desperate the Democrats or the Republicans\n[laughter] it's a good point because of the state that depends on the state you live at [laughter] because I think it is I think it is sort of any side\nI tell you what I think everybody needs to realize now though is it the country's main gauge one thing I learned that these people are fired up and like I was running into people I was in ... weeks\nI've been essentially all of this on a Tampa Dallas Phoenix at Las Vegas before sort of swinging at places in the front that that really Texas um but but the other three for sure and it's funny you say that I guess I Would there's probably more anxiety or anxious on the left\nAnd there is more than I Would describe feeling that way and I know right I Would describe it more as frustrated determination you know a little bit of anger a little bit of like the cab nothing really picked me up things like that so\nI don't know I I guess you could say in some places in Texas Democrats felt more desperate frankly in Nevada Democrats the more desperate but in Florida I could tell you the Republicans do a little bit so it really does depend on the state and I think to their local pop\n... and ... every news event is what are the ... election is what colors every news event it's the cabinet who's going to have the last October surprise a lot of work going to affect the voters walking into the booth and at this point or the or the Democrats or the ... and the cable news pundits we just heard\nIn that montage they seem to think it's going to be there's a bomb thing if they don't apprehend anybody and find out that it's a hoax from some leftovers\nI say I'm surprised we're usually pretty good at this I'm surprised we don't even have a ... yeah me too yeah I mean that's what I'll be honest that's why I jumped to foreign conclusion yeah a little bit because the fact that you know our our Secret Service Capitol police they have a database of crazy\n'cause it's very likely let you go to any campaign office conservative liberal what every type of campaign\nEnded attracts kooky people whether the left or right kooky lonely people who will probably a little off anyway and it doesn't take much to set them off and so we have a database for these cooks and the fact that they haven't my guess is it ain't in the database\nOf the ... people and in this country and that's why we've got to start to wonder jeez they don't have them now might be something different\nYou're right that actually does even play more do you want him in very good job chunk last one and if you don't want to comment that's fine\nBut the biggest story here today is not even a pipe bombs anymore it's your time he'd Megan Kelly who was let go yesterday who you talk about this well this will just come up a whole blackface scandal I personally think that it was nonsense and will come up okay\nHuge um I got a tax on like a quarter of five this morning she was so excited and you're\nThe author of fame for Arthur isn't a genius here's here's your song on the road and I know my my song is really like these are the devil so\nWell actually there was a drunk you know I'm really offended by ought to be a good heart just thrown off the air because I was a drug in my name is Arthur so the insinuation is that everyone named Arthur isn't drunk but I moved aside we ought to be more did bang on both\nSome pretty late on friday\nI was the movie time with the base that is a big story about author writes dollar in yesterday's New York daily news\nLawyer who defended Roger ales and hip any wiener says me too is moving from opening arguments to the trials stage and most recently of course he defended job and then going back to work with just an amazing job let's not forget along still try and got him back to work but\nI haven't been so nervous about an article coming out in in a long time because this burning was using the term third rail you know this is another third rail topic right I mean two things you have to make sure\nIt's balance and I have to compliment the writer Brian because he actually quoted me accurately and ... and it was pretty balanced but if you know I get quoted about criminal justice stories all the time and it's usually no problem but when I saw this as they are all\nSaid and what did you did was it was very good you know you made the argument but to me too movement is important that these things do happen they do exist and we should be sympathetic towards the women that go through this but every now and one day and every now and then I eat job an NGO\nIt does go the other way and we need to take heed when that happened\nAnd the problem is is the accusation has become the conviction and very rarely bingo I was lucky I have to give the the staff the ownership of of his radio station credit because\nNot well number one they knew the the person who was accusing him she had issue they fired her so they knew she didn't have a lot of credibility but they the loudest listen they allowed us to go in they allowed us to make our case and then eventually they wrote in our favor and he was back on the air and vote good\nFor just speaking of the pendulum perhaps swinging and the other way or you may have heard yesterday that the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley has referred Michael Evan ... and that the sweat Nick lady\nUh for criminal prosecution for obstructing justice perjury for a ... century lying or accusing him and falsely of rape\nOr don't have an old there may be some that's right they may be some but it may be a turning up the going on ...\nThe reason why it's very gutsy for him to do that as it does bring the whole cabinet thing back up to the surface which they kind of want to forget about but I think it's fantastic I mean I can remember once a case that I had\nA where it was a domestic violence case and it was a violation of or protection and they kept saying that my client was violating or protect he was going to his wife has when he wasn't supposed to and I believe the guy that he wasn't doing it so the top ... great detective audio I'm Sorry you got to bring a guy as we are at the precinct\nSitting at the desk in front of the detective detectives old school phone rings bring bring lingering he answers the phone it's the wife\nCome here he's here right now he's ringing my bell right now and he's sitting in front of the detective so I look at the technical you're going to arrest her right while you're going to go arrest to right this second rate for filing false report I'm not going to do that\nWhy not why not roe versus white ... oh so yes I Do think that for the majority of the people who are making legitimate claims they should be ferociously pursued\nAnd then the ones who are totally full of crap well you know what they should be prosecuted you with other should be there should be ramifications\nFor what you did I ruin a person's life trying to ruin approach speaking of ruining a person's life if I may jump into the Megan situation since I heard you guys talking about it and did you enjoy a conversation\nI didn't join the conversation and I I I see both sides of it I mean the truth is I Am I going to kill me for saying this but my my one of my favorite movies like really top three is pulp fiction ... hold on just the Samuel L. Jackson I mean\nWhat what I mean look the bottom line is going to write my mind is the third rail\nBut he's what's in someone's heart that really Kevin Ted Yoho said no no we're we're on the same page job I'm all of the only five seven CIA exactly half\nOf the rights you Spanish I just said on all sides in equities a week and let's not forget your evil man let's not forget Tropic Thunder Robert Downey junior he's another one that got away with them or he got away with dressing and he\nDid it as comedy but a typical retire and I'm going to have a hey as as a cultural appropriation charges literally ridiculous\nWhat I'm trying to do is provide contact says oh you're you're a hundred percent goes to the the way the white black people feel about black face because it is it was very recently it was insulting to them recently and the wound just still rural and so you have to take that into consideration I'd pointed out a Michael Moore dressing up or\nYou know in an anti Semitic way I mean that offended people justifiably\nAgain it depends on what's in people's hardly someone compared today on on somewhere on Facebook or would you allow someone to dress up like a nine eleven terrorists or not see\nThere's a big difference to the nine eleven terrorists and the Nazi and Diana Ross right I mean you're dressed up as a Nazi ... the only purpose they had was to do to kill you write evil or Diana Ross I mean again it's a giant it's what's in someone's\nHome and I said I read makes him in a previous conversation that she had just made that argument about the real housewives ... dressing up as a in a row when she was fine what she did find some ... like what are you\nSaid was true she they want it around in their right and here's the difference I was at Fox I was there
