anyway let's let's talk for a second about yesterday because I listen to you guys this morning I thought your your six o'clock hour was excellent you was spot on a couple of things as I did watch of hours and hours I mean\nThe biggest one is here I mean I'm not I'm stealing the stadiums are the cable news networks I mean they're going to get Super Bowl as kind of numbers which then they sell to the advertisers and that's how they make money it all comes back to money folks don't forget that\nShow the calendar right the reason why he kept the child and he said so breaking down and crying was his voice\nI had always kept a calendar and he was a young man I think in ninth grade and he's looking at his dad his dad is a role model as a father should be and his father kept like a daily journal and\nHe his father kept a journal ... you know one of the senators why do you still have the journal you on my dad's still kept all of his journals I can have on me and if you go in my basement right now in my little house in Hampton bays there is a a a a shelf\nAnd I have all kinds of diaries not necessarily for policy but I Do have one from ... and I can tell you the name of the journal it was called the preppy handbook law the eighties was old and my mom bought it for me and I have writings from high school in there\nSo it's not so unbelievable in one of the two of you at all I'm too lazy to writing a journal so am I that's the way Kavanaugh is not us no no those are respected burning it said in art that at all this guy is on like I learned another\nLet the ... so disciplined to keep a journal that's good I Wish I could add that this I don't have it\nRight so it's not so crazy to me that he kept a journal what was frustrating as saying hindsight is twenty twenty that whole thing

regulations are suspended from the wreckage in his act on traffic center I'm Joe Miller that Seventy seven WABC there's channel seven's bill Evans was the forecast there's a little bit ...\nMorning in the suburbs of the wise with the sunshine today as a warmer they did a a little more humid today the highest Seventy six in the south with\nWind up going to be really all it all nice storage through your week tonight some clouds as warm as rather ... sixty seven and that is warm for this time of the years we get on into October now some are we gonna clouds and sun warm in the highest seventies dined there'll be a shower leave the day and maybe if the\nNewsroom tomorrow evening tomorrow night as a ... and then tomorrow and I were dropped the sixty seven we got so gentle wins a hunch that will be fine there's little chance has brought you might enjoy giants using DNA testing and Bloomberg was fifty pounds only forty days now with a new office in white plains New York\nHe did which you know for for guys like when I was it was great because\nWhen you were innocent or something and somebody's charging you did something you didn't do you know you and I would get crazy and get upset like he did\nYou do of course the left as saying he's on hinged he's angry he has the wrong temperament for this job no matter what you can tell the guy's crazy bought rational folks go well hold on a second\nSomebody accuses you doing something you didn't do isn't that the way\nYou would react of course and then let's let's face it the people are you just alluded to the ... the quote unquote left they didn't want him to do well they didn't want it to be effective and that was the only way he could have been affected was the act like an innocent man accused falsely\n... coming up later this morning you'll get the Judiciary Committee vote\nComing up tomorrow will be the procedural vote to launch debate coming up on Monday the procedural vote to end the debate and assuming that Brett Kavanaugh is okay he could be confirmed as early as this Tuesday and it does really come down Bernie to three people that are really going to determine his fate and that's Collins\nMurkowski and flake do you have confidence that those three will come around and do the right thing before Tuesday\nI Believe so but\nBefore we go even get on a Tuesday today is an important vote because flake is actually on that Senate Judiciary committee for three of them are on all three of them ... well house cantaloupe just flick just like okay now flake so if flight votes no\nHe sides with the Democrats and then it gives the Democrats the eleventh to ten majority with like ... or to stop the vote from proceeding or to the to the Senate floor although there may be ways that they can manipulate around that but that's an important\nI mean so how white votes today he's the guy he's the guy today or do you have come a cow ski and fled are up about factors on Tuesday accounts in college so she doesn't make much else he called and by the way this other guy Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia\nWhose indicated a sympathy he's up implied sympathy for\nFor capital so uh he's he could be a factor on Tuesday but today that vote at nine thirty with with this guy flake and nobody knows how he's going to vote right that's a that's a that's a major deal over the if it go and look if Kavanaugh it doesn't get a a ... get picked it doesn't get confirmed or the vote doesn't move or whatever\nI mean Trump has a list of uh thirty other people they put that list out you know\nBack in twenty sixteen so what are they going to do I mean ... uh uh what Lindsey said is true that there are hoping the big installed this\nTo turn out twenty and maybe steal the election from Trump which is not going to happen by the way but let's say you believe that are they going to continue to ... every single candidate until twenty Tony in this particular case yeah what what they what they want to do is\nGet past the mid ... not allow anybody confirmed before the midterms in other words the reason why they keep calling for the FBI investigation is because that could take up to seven months yeah so they would they would then hope that they would regain the Senate even though\nThey're not favored to regain the seven ... that would that would be where their hopes lie so then Trump would never get a nominee through\nI mean at the very least that's what they're hoping I which is why an FBI investigation would you agree with FBI investigation and if they did it would push it way back\nSo perhaps early next year you know you know I think um who go back and forth I think she's telling the truth he's telling the truth and\nIt was riveting television at times it was over nine hours by the way so it was a lot and they're also that was kinda boring I mean first good as Lindsey Graham was that's how bad show than white side out of Rhode Island while satellite I mean that was a White House it was ridiculous some of the Arab all but\nIn the end I think that what everybody is saying this morning is the truth whether you're a Republican or Democrat and if you're not knee deep in this thing an agenda driven\nThat was one of the most embarrassing days to America has ever been through it was both sides it's just disgusting you got to people here whose lives have been destroyed cabin on them out of what he will never come back from this even if he's confirmed on Tuesday\nThis young lady obviously once something horrific and most put on display yesterday\nJust for political gain for the Democrat so everything aside I Believe horror I Believe him by by by\nWhat we saw yesterday was the slow destruction of two large\nThat's pretty ... it was the job interview from health for him\nAnd uh the the Senate Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein in particular did not handle is well now she ruined really true lives yes who they are they could've investigated this\nIn private leading up to this time right now they could have done it in private she didn't do that do it that well and she ended up leaking or somebody on her staff ended up leaving the lady's name\nMuch to the lady chagrin whatever anyway so we ended up here with this horrific day yesterday though yeah it was great for TV ratings and all that stuff but it was bad grass you did a good job pointed that out too
