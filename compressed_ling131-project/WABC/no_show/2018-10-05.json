Rosenberg promoting and sit in the morning of a ... flagship store at forty nights and Madison Avenue inexperienced exceptional quality style and service out of very best\nWell I don't have an answer because I'm never having been given an answer so quickly all I've gotten is that they're going in a different direction whatever that means and that just remains to be seen\nSo they're going to they're going to bring in the answer to Carter former player and a and in your former teammate day baloney who I Know it was a nice guy but\nHe did the other games on radio by the white Dave uh the day that the radio so they'll be twenty six a great\nDay yellow Dave Dave an answer we're good friends and they do a good job and if a day will probably be doing a little bit more price and aunts and does a great job also so uh it's disappointing for me\nA lot of it is disappointing ... I mean let's be honest jokes I mean you know you're asking pitched right\nWell yes or no oh God you don't want to be a part of something that you're not you don't feel like you're appreciated ... and uh and so if that's the case then I Would prefer to go elsewhere I as a player\nI've been treated a couple of times and so unfamiliar with the feeling you can you can handle it yes hello you're not happy with it necessarily yeah you may agree to disagree I'm writing so coaches and managers make decisions on players they're looking for something different\nAnd I've been there and uh and so but what's um probably harder me more than anything else like this weekend I'm running into fans and I'm having to say to them oh by the way I'm not backing I'm having to explain so that's the difficult part\nBut having said that I think the rangers are themselves the organization going to be using me a little bit more so I'm going to be doing\nA lot of good ... take away your ID card I mean you got into building your ... but by the way the rangers or for two down from us the officers so you you're in the building\nI'm In a building here in the forties still yes so I'm I'm going to be doing a lot of what the fans do and just kind of watching in like a fan watching ... it'll be there tonight walking around getting the fans excited yes it'll be more hands on now rice speaking to them yes you able to actually a talk with him and be up close when you there's a lot of fun to that\nBird there is a lot of fun but when you do finally cut all ties then you could let loose a like this morning so I [laughter] a couple of\nRaces started two days ago we had the Gulf of at two days ago and a lot of the guys are and they're celebrating the Ninety four team that won the Stanley Cup yes sure a lot of the guys were into February eighth I guess it's going to be with their night wrath of them are here now right so and that's where the rangers are really good at taking care of their alumni\nAppreciating them ... and so a lot of guys around and we have fun when we get together\nNow to MSG is here locally in New York obviously we've got three hockey teams who got the rangers that was the auditors but nationally\nStill a lot of hockey out there are just so Melrose in fact this morning on ESPN but the hockey in Canada is still a big big thing in fact is Don Cherry those horrible suits\nAh yeah Don has gone [laughter] I like to think I'm a small version of him know he's a little out there but\nThere there's there should be other opportunities for a guy that is still love it in Canada and some people over here in New York City yeah to get out there and show off your hockey expertise\nAnd I don't want to leave New York you don't want to leave New York right act I want to figure out how can I Do my own show how can I say oh well what do you think\nAbout hum hum after me Sunday afternoons right here in WABC yeah we can do that we can do I like the idea of what I Want is is to have a live audience right maybe up in a in a situation where the fans watching the game I share a part of it\nFans can be part of it because I Want to have a boy so such a stopped right across the street there you're going to show right here and will be live it's out and people can walk into the do gay and ... and ... and it'll be great yeah everybody\nBy the way that that is going to be great if you do that would WABC but I'm sure MSG if they're not going to let you I mean you you rub do gay and the rangers and New York city there's no way they're going to let you it's only got one of them now but he's still there and they're going to they're going to figure something else out there's got to be a next step no doubt\nI mean I'm confident of that well no not ... at them yeah right down hotel\n[laughter] Hi well\nI Do when you walked in I was playing a piece of sit sports Sunday show this week I did interview number twenty two and you'll ranger a program and that is Kevin shot and Kirk Kevin came here last year for those great years in St Louis the short stint Washington only played forty six games you heard his knee so what you heard there was him talking about queen you know they want from\nA guy that obviously coach the team to Stanley Cup finals a couple of years ago\nA to a guy from Boston University who is brand new very young hockey team and\nQuite frankly Vonnie predicted to be a\nNot a very good hockey team so we get what are they start the season tonight\nWater legitimate expectations for the blue shirts\nI'm going to say what he said he said a couple of days ago and he's been saying you're going to be nice Lisa perhaps what he said well yes and this team is going to be better than what you think they're going to be a I kind of like what I saw towards the end of the season the the team was depleted but they still have some young players out there\nAnd uh they were fine they were they handled themselves just fine and now with the new coaching new different type of coaching and the thing I like about this guy is\nHe wants to play the game a little more physical work ... he wanted to kind of limited all the pushing and shoving into much rough stuff on the ice you wanted to go up fast game a whistle the whistle and but with this guy he's saying no ... we're going to be a little more Sam paper\nWe're going to protect our gold tender we're going to initiate Mm right we're going to create energy in the building\nAnd uh and if you don't do it you're not going to play nice and so I like this about this guy and he's a well respected guy he's a teaching type of cultures which I watch this guy after every game he's going to lose his voice because he's just very vocal\nAnd so I'm liking what I'm saying and I liked the players good ... yeah we got a nice mix of guys or the back and that play hard fight and I believe these guys are going to be a score goals it's how they're going to defend\nFolded maybe this could be burning what line just said here there's got to gay on the Bernie and said show folks go ahead and here's this that Bernie the guys on this roster right now for the rangers active players on the rangers in their careers have combined to score a hundred and sixty nine goals\nThat is thirty goals less than what the buffalo Sabres scored last year and they were the lowest scoring team in the NHL so you're saying they're going to put the puck into that yet but all the numbers say\nThey're not going to put the ... Internet yeah well I Believe\n[laughter] I'll leave [laughter] I liked I liked the optimism\nI Believe they're going to be able to score goals and a\nWhole ... gonna be good writer so he\nRecall you Ron Quixote\nYeah [laughter] yeah that's a of a deep deep literary reference but a good one I must must must admit it but I\nDon't care if you are going to be pretty good yeah\nThe other thing that's coaches doing he's allowing these guys to be a little more aggressive offensively yeah where they had the kind of the third corps beyond the third man high now he's having these guys to work tight download three as a pact come up with the park and come up with some place\nAnd of course you have to have good judgment when you're playing that way but they're going to be an attack mode by like that and uh and because they have the speed the skill and they use in the news ah they're going to play at a fast pace and so let's see what comes out of this\nWhat's really important they come out of the gate or not below five hundred right it can be two in a ride a young team you got to build some confidence so if they can get to five hundred in the first thing games in tonight's a good test they're going to play a good team\nTimes are good test so there's going to be a lot of close games and then close games is just little bounces here and they're making decisions good decisions with the ... so they're going to be in a lot of games is just a matter of get a little puck luck\nAnd some of these young players that become better quicker than they dissipate than this team or come January if they're close there within six points of making the\nPlayoffs the Stanley Cup punt come down and got to have that mentality after that the mindset is to get into the playoffs\nCome January there within six point they would be I what I'm saying is probably looked and maybe add a player or two they can do that they can do that and so uh I'm I Want I'm optimistic for good reason but I'm really I Want them\nTo somebody who is this going to ... yeah yeah yeah well I think\nIt's the legendary rendezvous gay and the Bernie and said Joe streaming live on Facebook by the way hello folks around who gave us and when we first got to know each other you know may uh you recognize me from Fox News boy and a lot and that's how we developed his friendship and so you're a political guy in a way\nI tend to pay attention I Want to be informed right ... exactly right so ah I mean this is a real emotional time right now in motion a week and you're informed do you want to a positive opinion on anything that's happening right now\nWhile it's a that's the problem you give your opinion and that's a fight [laughter]\nRight yeah OK earlier in this battle tell me I ended up but it's what you know for Kevin I'm looking at and it's just sad to me it's the hate in the sadness yeah and it's elevated to a point now you can't even bring it up in conversation let's throw you got to make if you're you it's like you have to whisper this stuff right and\nYou imagine if they took ... to ... to gay to task Everytime you grab some girls as a studio fifty four Nineteen\nSo [laughter] I said if it was unwelcome may in fact I'm sure it was very well several hours after it was the opposite [laughter] oh yeah I Love\nIt back and some of these women are grabbing I'm sure I got it you know you you're a great looking guy you're probably going really really like you like the Dorian Gray but but and if you if\nYou believe in a minute this when you walk into that arena tonight yeah okay and you haven't played for the rangers and how long how many years exactly eighty eight so you're talking about Thirty years and then you walk and you still see people sitting there wearing a number of ten run to gay Jersey yes is that better than by agra\nOh man this is just some\nWholesome Seventy so ABC\nThat type of fat you know soccer mom between the ages of thirty five and\nI like and I go on she is the reason we have school shootings which is not true in the black [noise]\nThat's\nObviously a joke based on a stereotype blacks do not go to school\n[noise] you know at one time I actually said that we sold ... female comic\nWorld right in the ... and she got ... crazy 'cause he's like what do you mean female ... yeah that's a True Washington brewer can suck my I have\nA big one she's absolutely right though I I mean she is she says gender she's ... she's like Joan Rivers and Don Rickles although we're the God I'm hugely gender less because I don't know if I'm a guy or an hour because it's\nLike I got the lesbian hair cut I got the male boots I go\nI don't know what's going up would you like to paint is you know more not any more I don't even I don't like nothing wrong with the boy was added on big big big big big ball but I was in the sex drive you said you lost that did it come back at all or no no\nAh by the way I'm ...
