being claim exam know what's next Roger you by the U.S department of Veterans Affairs\nYeah we work well together and down the ... second season right and it's been fun it's a lot of work because um you know the cast and crew changes every year and a lot of them are experience so it's like starting over every year right but um I wouldn't trade it for the\nWorld's she that's what's funny about the show Bernie kind of like a lot of our our radio show like our voices go across the radio but people don't understand that throughout the show even before the show the jail this Matt this preparation a lot goes into it so for you guys they see the glory part you're on the boat you're on television but\nThe truth is there's a lot of cleaning up a manure that goes into this job every right casually settled a glum wrote most like metaphorically right we're not land on the beach drink an umbrella drinks all day long ride on cash right although most of the time you are [laughter]\nHey listen well yesterday when we promo the upcoming yes for today we mentioned you guys and our engineer and he was like oh my I Can't believe it the most beautiful women in the world on this boat he's like over the moon with that with the with the good looking girls I mean so there's a lot of uh you know obviously\nIt's ... the six season is that in fact eat eat\nA lot of ... lot of uh as I mentioned not just getting good looking base let us get there like that you have to wait well absolutely I mean if you have to be you know stuck on a boat for six seven we write and miserable you'd look you've got a choice\nRight out of some ... not just the girls are guys are handsome man but you know it's not just about that I mean I think that some of the writing some of the\nRelationships that go on tape on your boat or with some of the folks at work together and you know I remember the love triangle I may have been season for I don't have the exact season but uh the what goes on back and forth between the folks on the boat is just as interesting as how you guys look\nOr I mean and everybody gets a little bit more attractive than season goes on because you're stuck on the boat with them right and you're making more than a decade and second of all\nIt is right so so is it more stuff that goes on when the cameras are off in other words we see all the fun the controversy the back and forth the relationships but some of that stuff carry on Capitol only after the episodes or over is this something that some of these relationships some of these of the folks back and forth\nWhat's that all year long does it stop once the cameras are\nPretty much it does yeah once the cameras stabbed once they're off the boat it's like it's been a slight see\nThat's it yeah yeah I mean one of those folks actually leaves is it um is it called like the last eight camps or they get sad I mean like ... for example he was a ... seasons which he said when he got replaced in season five\nI don't think so he's doing great things in Fort Lauderdale he's had a great catering business and only say friends that some people you're happy to see them I think the\nSecond I've always a long time yeah enough time some people don't make it say that that's true yeah\nPlenty of time and you know there's some ugliness a or\nA K chest pain for example I mean you took some heat on Twitter and the captain stepped up big time for you just recently\nYeah I did I mean I think people don't realize that not joining a show called America's next top model and doing a show about working so they can comment on my work all they want\n... somebody came after you about your physical appearance yes and they weren't very nice of you\nKnow but I think they're just bored and you know that right there's a lot of negativity on the Internet but I kept in stepped up and\nWhat you said what did you say cats on the phone or I don't recall the incidence specifically but but I don't have no but there's this but you ... your job here\nIs not just the captain the boat maybe it's not your job because you're actually about a guy in that part you end up becoming kind of like the father figure for all these young kids I mean they they they look to you for for leadership and advice and I I Believe really from watching the show that you generally care about all these guys are ...\nAbsolutely it's it's funny because you know you take eight or nine good looking people write relatively well educated ah\nProbably nobody by the way that nobody else has put 'em in real close quarters apply a lot of pressure throw large quantities of expendable cash and alcohol and what could possibly go wrong [laughter] really [noise]\nThe the love boat the steroids or something like that but our way over the top are you are you out to see a lottery your is it pretty much in\nPort for example a into Haiti were addicts emotionally than\nYours so people these people and not as they don't have the sea legs necessarily they get sea sick a lot to some of them to write\nSome of them do it on yeah they'd get great comic 'cause they throw up on the on the boat yeah that was one of the ones that are fun to watch are the ones that like overly and by the first day on I mean I just burn it of the first day at Harvard anything that will hold still and a glass of life\nAnd then all of a sudden we get out and see and they get a little emotion going on a lawyer John they're looking for a receptive\n[laughter] laughing through it is the most miserable feeling why get seasick myself we don't get a a like a whale watching crews for God's\nSake which I did last year in um so funny you said that in a San Francisco I was sick as a dog yes I hated that feeling you have to cap and correct me if you have to look at the horizon in order to have a that\nHelps and that helps and the amount of alcohol you know you don't want to limit that other acts and then when they do yes\nSo some of the stuff that goes on with you the season I Know that you have to again maybe step in between Israel and more limited though Josiah yeah and ... now you start to buddy up to Josiah right you guys get tight\nHe's lovely he's a hard worker he's experienced he's ... isn't held on lovely to into a I Would say she's different let me tell ya right very different yeah so you like to say more than I Do I not and I'm favorite because he worked so hard well you're not supposed to play favorites as it might just supposed to but you don't care there's I\nDon't like so many more that does their job and not somebody who doesn't\nOkay that's a little I used to have some very tough to work for by the way\n[laughter] I Know I Know [laughter] and half\nAs the way it should be like man the votes listen and see what you like that do do you try to treat everybody equally all like hey do you give the kids more cake when they deserve it well you know when\nWhen people do an exceptional job I mean as far as I'm concerned you don't get a pat on the back for just doing your job and showing up there is no participation trophy sheer wow if you really expel you go out to be a way you do the extra mile you do the extra five miles that's when you get that a boy and if you have a little screwed up along the way\nMaybe overlook that because once you've done in the past is so much better\nPony sounds like President Trump [laughter] hey listen below deck tonight on the bravo channel nine o'clock\nThe beginning of the sixth season a captain Lee and take chest pain in the studio with Bernie and said I have to ask you guys are any ... any shark attacks\nOr along the way I mean people have to just jump off the boat and you know lose a leg or something\nI'm not since rocky and several engine shark infested waters this you know it's not it's a nice new experience\nWhile the Caribbean and when I Would take cruises with Danielle burning ties in the Caribbean they would throw the garbage over like midnight on the boat and you would see the fins sought to circle so she thought about somebody of a more than one stand\nNow now I don't know if\nI don't think there are a lot of shorts in to Haiti or yeah although there are a lot of sharks why wouldn't there be quite whites\nA huge huge reach the whole island is around all the cheese nouns are surrounded by ...\nSo do you know everything like every island what kind of fish they've got I mean are you is that part of what you need to know as a cashier and one of the iceberg zone of it but [laughter] they're in the glasses [laughter]\nHey let me tell you something that guy or a two story that boat was going down captain Lee and he stood there behind the control as the water came breaking through the glass and he went down with the ship you if your boat starts to go down you on a jet ski back to New York and Fifteen\nMinute [laughter] first one I [laughter]\nI'm actually put on the back right now [laughter]\nGoing faster you for [laughter]\nAny anything else we should know about we talked about you and your ideal captain we talked about getting emotional what are we going to Ashton plays a big role the new chef Adrian he plays a big role anything else we should know about this season\nI mean I'll second happened land that it's the best season ever had a great cats curled up our largest yacht and a new exotic location\nAlso it's a it's a new boat it's been very very new\nIn a hundred and eighty five feet\nA monster she weighs so let me ask you let me ask you noticed 'cause all I care about to be honest these guys are great I Love the show love you how do we have to get an episode get on the votes only kill ya oh you haven't yet Mr skin women\nWe want to endure amount right onto the or preference she you know you don't see that I'm sure I'm not a ... we got is that right yeah I Would do the show from the vote even I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not kidding but\nWho do we get to pick the place in the boat and Charles Koch fears Chelsea Piers [laughter]\nCounty I haven't yeah how how exotic [laughter] nothing like a few of them has kind of a baby [laughter]\nThat'd be great if we can watch the dinner but it's really [laughter] so is it\nA below deck tonight on bravo the sixth season starts the best season ever according to cap the only and Kate chest pain tonight on bravo we wish you guys are all the best with the new season\nIn a book to captain lead you to thank you so congratulations you guys have both beautiful your show was quite Meehan bunny love it and feel free to come back anytime good luck\nWho's in a match up and they're always great going back to you orange soul you know this is what's at stake this could be another Yankee writes on post season\nOr could be you know I mean the one game against you know Oakland is always uh always a big game and it's you know it's going to be exciting but you know to see if they get by Oakland and go in the Boston in a you know here we go again another great series uh\nUh and uh you never know what's going to happen or you know they are there are getting healthy right now and are are getting are starting to play good and uh that's a great site\nYet but you can never tell Bucky Dent in the Bernie and since you're Bucky leading up to a game in Nineteen Seventy eight you guys are\nIn August you uh fourteen games back in a couple of the or a stitches catfish hunter Jim badey whoever remembers they were both her they were both hurts so uh what was a process like I mean did you really really think that it was feasible for you guys to do to accomplish what you accomplished\nOh absolutely I mean you know we didn't want you to before these guys were professionals that they knew how to do it you know and it was just a matter of getting healthy Boston was playing you know seven fifty baseball first half but then they started to get the bill they started to get some guy shirt and uh we started to get healthy and\nWe uh we said if we can make up one game a week of September we've got um seven and er that's that's where we'll\nCatch them in and that's exactly what happened you know we got healthy and the one guy that that I just you know the answer too much about his laundry that you're just a phenomenal you know shot young you know every fifth\nDay we knew we were going to win and they were captors came back and beating came back from store to get help through then we started putting together for five game winning streaks and as we got close um you know the feeling changed and we want him to September and and uh and did what we have to do\nThey talk about the uh you know the great years to ... may when the young this year gooden in eighty five which is good as it got luggage read\nThat you know in Seventy eight but you guys was was just so amazing you know it really started a monkey with the Boston Massacre that game and fully September when Willie Randolph knocked inside runs I think that's kind of the time you guys started to feel like we're going to catch his mother my first\nEver yeah oh yeah we want to know the first game than you know or are we beat him and then uh you know we swept him and then we went back home and uh and play them at home and uh you know everything changed I mean you could feel the electricity you know in in the one big thing that\nThat always talked about you know is the fact that you know when ... took over you know the papers were on strike bomb lemon time\nYes so every everything kind of calm down and everybody could like relaxing just you know concentrate on playing the game baseball and and that's what happened\nYou know it's amazing to the Bucky Dent you actually won the world series MVP which is sort of overlooked in all this horrible\nYeah you know with with this a home run forty years ago I mean does that was a big deal\nThat was you know uh you know we just uh you know people just remember that you know because it was a one big moment we're kind of the whole world shut down and it seems like you know everybody was watching the game you know it was a holiday and ah everybody's stayed home and and that's the thing I I I get a ... amazed that you know forty years ago and\nPeople walk up to me is not a day goes by where somebody doesn't say hey you know seven years old in Iran home I I'm you know the red Sox fans you know they have either Yankee fans love me you know Red Sox fans you know they'll say Iran home you hit the home run out through my TV out the window you know I get a chuckle\nOut of that but you have to remember that game you know sports is a game of big moments in that was a big moment I mean it was like when I was watching you know ... when he broke my heart hits home rather beat the Yankees you know are in the world series\nThat's very good analogy Bucky Dent forty years ago today the big moment against the red Sox but like Bernie segue point Ernie because on one of the world series MBP against the Dodgers so I don't know this monkey but you weren't in the New York papers this week\nYou know why [laughter] no okay it's a great story or something to do with all that so bad it's well it is actually kind of and it's all about football so the jets yeah I Know the jets Bucky get blown out by Jacksonville on Sunday\nSo they're interviewing the jets head coach Todd Bowles after the game and he says and I quote\nWhat can I say I don't know what else I can do talking about preparing his team to play well according to my friend Mike McConnell when the New York post\nWhen you imagine the Yankees in the eighties early eighties and you guys are like Eighteen and thirty one I guess after some loss\nYou came out and said the same exact thing that Todd Bowles said last Sunday the difference is Chris Johnson didn't sign of a time bowls but George Steinbrenner did sign up for you is that document\nAnd yeah I mean you know we watched as tough game you know a ... tough games you know ah that week and then you know uh I think Randy belonged to hit a home run in the eighth inning Alex game up and we wound up getting the I think they squeezed or whatever on it and then\nUm you know uh you know I was just one of those moments where it's a you know and said hey you know it was almost like what am I going to do you know we lost a tough game you know so all we gotta go we've got to go back and play tomorrow so maybe they didn't you\nKnow put the rest of the story and they just worked out but ah yeah you have talked moments where you go geez you know this is a tough one you know where you're going to do you know go go play tomorrow right wide open and go get him but uh\nYeah I did get fired in a ... that night after the game actually I knew I was going to get fired because I had a conversation with general manager about getting a player in there because of all ... get out of the first inning and we were needed a book that guy and so when I hang up the phone I looked at my wife at the time and I said\nI'm going to get fired him all she goes what [laughter] I go yeah I'm a little far tomorrow and that's exactly what happened with the note under the doors at his room at twelve o'clock and George Carlin part\nThat's never Pleasanton never pleasant but out of Lebanon lucky guess on on the Bernie ... listen\nTo them all let's fast forward to twenty Eighteen tomorrow's big wild card game against the athletics for all the marbles with the Yankees at home or a Aaron Boone has some big decisions to make among them the biggest decision is who to pitch to knock Severino or a half I mean what would Bucky Dent do\n[laughter] as senator died when I get very [laughter] ah\nI live in a phone call and get rid of all they're\nCaught out but you know that you know that's his decision you know he's been with those guys all your you know a\nA ... you know been a an an aids for them as a pitch well lately but uh the kid had just come overt pitch really really well you got to knock on you know that's that's a tough decision and I'm sure that they'll\nGo figure like I was just one game it's you know if it's going on it's it's for all the articles\nOn the way out here but you look at this Yankee team this year and ... it's a home on on Saturday then judge and they go on to break the record set by the Nineteen Ninety seven Seattle mountains and your mother was gripping hit fifty six you know hit forty he round here twenty three so rental hits thirty one this Yankee team this year\nHit more home runs in any team in the history of major league baseball by the way with guys like Enron judging gallery Sanchez too big time homerun hitters on the bench for a long time that's a pretty amazing feat by this Yankee club yes\nWell you got to give them a lot of credit you know you've got to give like catch a lot of credit because they have that you know they they made some good decisions they had some kids you know the kids are a set of carry on a long way to share you know a a young kid that they're\nAll ... and he actually broke Joe DiMaggio was Michael doubles that's amazing\nAmazing and you know ... or ... at second base those kids are come in and stepped in and and play a big time for them you know and uh you know the ... who's come over and just put a a big charging them you know when they were floundering there you know he said some big home runs for a minute and\nIt caught I got 'em over that hump to they could get judge and some of those other guys back or hurt you know so uh they they are a great job as far as having that to get them through the season\nBucky Dent forty years ago today that big a big three run home run propelling the Yankees the world series victory back in Nineteen Seventy eight listen we're at a time but the Denver thank you very very much for appearing on the Bernie and said show this one is great morning\nAlways buddy always for you you guys have a great day\nYou very well on a super guy [laughter]\nSeventy seven ABC
