Nielsen no this is\nEric ... how about ... very Nelson Ninety Seventy two you know what's on the country the week I was born in man you know what does that mean you can't live in living was that what are you gonna kill yourself well I mean what what kind\nOf audience and yell at me and probably kill that scare the hell out of the girls and guys telling her that all the time here but I don't mean sometimes it was it in ...\nSometimes girls like that no but I think for the most part I don't know it's it's it has been for a little a little ...\nI wouldn't like that I see not just you come across as needy when you do\nFor you don't want to needy guy who you know I Want a guy who doesn't need me but ah one eight hundred a phrase\nNice to to knock on genetic dumbest thing on his own number I Want a guy doesn't need well now it's like going to be independent and now the guy you want somebody needs to you on a need each other but you don't want to beach cycle\nOut at that and that's all I'm saying okay you don't want to be nuts and\nSet yourself up for a you know like I said just like I just so traumatic devastating break up a public like in this case with this guy this guy who just got sober about six months ago and if\nYou can't help but what if this is this is an emotional guy this is I'm ... I'm trying to say is try to help it somehow you can't do that if you've built in a certain way there's no time to irrational that he's already tried to discipline yourself on\nLike say you should be telling this is when I tell my fourteen year old daughter you should tell either don't go with any guy that seems to needy and now he wants to own you which is she's dealing with corn going now see that's what I'm saying he's mad at her because she doesn't like him back and he doesn't want her to talking to other boy I'm like he's doing the few at fourteen forget\nYou know he's crazy and then you've got you got jealousy and violence on the way they don't know if you don't have to pay\nThat is what I'm saying you want to do it is you want to prevent murder I'm trying to help both people vote part I'm trying to help I I'm I'm a I'd be damned good or a couple of ... you would be I think so Dr burning instead of Dr phil doctor be now\nWell come on late night he laid on my couch thank you for that sweetheart\nLike this is like the ... the ... I read about this I I I just didn't care by the way it is a member she was a she was at a wreath of Franklin funeral yes I did Bill Clinton and Louis Farrakhan perverted unrest and bill ... Oh yes yes there was one more this hour job now Sharpton that's right\nYeah I don't mean know blueberry pie when I got in front of me [laughter] I got some some ask tough talk [laughter] or something I don't know\nYeah it was so so anyway I just wanted to say that for our young I Know we have a burgeoning a young demo out there listening to the Bernie and such are just discovering us and I want to know that we all want them to know that we're here for okay well I think they've figured that out you did a great job thank you very much certainly thank you\nI mean this is just some\nWholesome seventies you ABC [noise]\nBut I'm not saying that trust everybody in the White House somehow that maybe\nThis is this a roof and this is a vicious [noise] place Washington DC is a vicious vicious place the attacks [noise] the the bad mouthing the speaking behind your back and you know in\nMy way I feel very comfortable here [laughter]\nPresident Donald Trump courtesy of CBS [laughter] the minutes luckily stolen\nLast night the atmosphere that atmosphere in which I thrive yeah forty two of the president but ah\nHe didn't have a very nice things to say about ... something like the guys are good guy but he's probably leaving soon\nYeah he thinks he's leaving they didn't say anything bad about you know he's he thinks he's a Democrat Mattis was for staying in the Iran deal yeah so they have had some differences aside the overall by and large are I mean getting rid of ISIS and all I think mad as has been a a a term it tremendous asset to be I'll be said when he leaves as well\nWell he did and he was going to be said Donald Trump he said everybody everybody leaves that happens a lot of John Kelly in him hate each other so that's not going to be upsetting when that ends Kelly in Madison County and then the President Trump right don't call them President Trump if you're a friend of his he's uncomfortable with that\nHe's like even my friends they call me Mr President yeah Donald was what do you mean there'll be so formal all the time I think he's talking to you\nBut honestly when I spoke to him and my from my backyard that was in the summer of Seventeen\nAbout six months after he took office I called them and and it was kind of awkward I we had a call Mr President right yeah I Know what the call he says his own friends and family call not yeah ... it was a but he got used to it is used to it now and he feels like the present two years in a specially after\nWhatever he's accomplished all the good things he feels he feels good about it and I'm so Mr President is a very applicable and it was back then as well\nBut now it's a\nIt's sticking its I mean even the ... even have the news anchors on local news or low the goal the president of the United so President Trump they should just call them Trump they call President Trump now right he had a good weekend with the the past are coming out of a turkey out of house arrest\nBig rally Saturday Night and then the big interview with Leslie stall\nYou didn't even have to pay ransom rain or exchange anybody for that guy no\nNobody did was uh he used the the weather wait full faith and force of the economic power of the United states\nTo squeeze turkey into a into a recession\nAnd they were like okay we'll let them go right then that's it then goes to a nickel and now well I guess they'll pull back a little bit and they'll say I don't know they'll hold the line a little bit in the future\nAnd the same thing with the uh the Saudi Saudi people that's a it's another complicated they would have meant that dude that they killed well yes uh\nThey they they were apparently they did kill them but ah he's not an American citizen and with the the ... with the president is saying is that\nThe ...
