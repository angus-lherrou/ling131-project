I don't either way but you know when you're a parent ... she likes one kid while the other side [laughter]\nSo like I Love my kids the same is a kind of the same way with the ... or you like a I'm a Spiderman guy I'm an Iron Man guy but you gotta love 'em all the same\nSo ... you don't have to love them all the same like if you guys ever check out the show um I you'll find that I'm a big Spiderman X. men guy you know I Am yeah a model of Superman I hate to admit you hate I hate him we said there's like him a lot that's why as the ...\nAh [laughter] All right I\nDon't know about what why do you do what you are comparatively don't like Superman what is it about him\nAs this there's nothing I like like when when you have a degree of difficulty they go in right Superman has no difficulty kryptonite criminals that guy yeah but how often doesn't run across kryptonite\nEvery single episode I was [laughter]\nI mean first okay so so you're not a big Superman guy you like Spiderman next man what about you\nFor me it's ghostwriter its moon night it's characters that are more darn gritty and dark like\nYour whole crack alone don't [laughter] only when it's last was a special [laughter] I like that I like to go try to about ...\n... yeah ghost writer fortunately we didn't get the movies we wanted out of it why not studio so\nLike Tony I brought up the studios have a lot to do with this and that's why Disney is now using their power to get marvels content back to them so they can kind of see it where it should be so we're getting Spider Man with the MC MCI you were getting the X. men coming back right we're getting you know geeks heaven and everything we want to see yeah\nI'm so maybe fingers crossed will get the characters that we love portrayed the way they should do\nWhat about you John what show up in a fund me all the time because I'm that guy tell us everything I Do I feel badly singling out you know you love everybody for this for the most shiny us [laughter] that was a command still considered a cold was out of this deal oh well that's a that's a great question he won't even\nMore from from that super friends that are in a lot of women that both of you and I could be the one that I look at somebody I Love it I didn't do he's out now he's well he's out there and oh he was gay [laughter]\nOff and you know there's like a joke [laughter] ever uh\nNo I'm so so now they're trying to make him and this is what this is what happens I refer votes on and make them more role on and make them more butch Brian I'm right you know he was he was ... it was real soft back in the past have told me this is this is gonna sound blame you're probably just before that let me guess you're famous Black Panther [laughter]\nActually one of my top but he's not the way he's one of my favorites that was a\n... movie freaking movie and I met a Jordan okay when I went to hard rock not first weekend and we smash guitars you know he smashed right next to me guys a sweetheart by the way\nOh no yeah it seems like a real cool guy I mean I I like ... I you know what I what I liked about comic books and this was going back to you know my childhood sixties seventies I'm there weren't a lot of places and this is I I think to almost to the point about Superman or some men didn't have any problems\nRight yeah no problems I mean this guy would win his whole costume underneath his soup and never sweat never um was he was playing and what's her name the\nLast one was the same um and I guess he ruined her for everybody [laughter] so\nProblems with them and the University of guys like ... or Peter Parker who had this this power but he was always struggling all these marvel characters had issues the X. men you know I mean as as a young black man\nI related to the fact that that the general population hated the so called mute us a good point right and so it it it it it it it spoke to me in a way\nAnd so when I looked at characters yeah I was looking\nI was trying to find myself but the even the black panther back in the six I think they made him hit but now he's much more hip or you know in two thousand uh Eighteen and he was way back when I was way back when I thought he was cool but I couldn't really relate to this this this individual so uh Spiderman was my guys fighting you know yeah\nIt was white and both but like you said he was a kid that is a ... anxiety doesn't really know what he should do when you should do it so he said he fought\nAbsolutely hate well and that's what you mean and so so when you're flawed and you're trying to overcome that to me is what the hell was as if you had no issue yeah then that's a really stepping up\nA capital you know I really want to keep me of like an hour I Swear to God so how many young guys how many folks are going to show up over the next four days for ah for comic um\nEighteen million ... million jobs and making them astronomical not bad yeah\nI mean just Thursday Thursday's primarily the short the small day and we couldn't\nWalk yesterday while you go and you guys the free of you guys are once again the fireside chats you weren't there every day so what do they see you what can they can talk to you guys meet you guys\nAre so I ... back in Philly we have a boost that our towns is one more here's press whole Texans more enjoying the show gotcha after the con is over in Iraq we're actually doing an after our show um where we're going to have special guest Sidney we've already got one last night but really it's just to get an idea of what's happening at the concept\nThat night and you can hardly do lines of what was going to ask how much it [laughter]\nI got tired of seeing now listen I mean I I'm not dressing up but I Will say that yeah no uh there there's some pretty hot\nI'm Down there just up the superheroes and I'm In um that I was just the Spiderman guy here yeah [laughter]\nI was gonna live thought this was somebody\nBefore we let you guys run this was great by the way you guys are on the oh gee podcast network yes again you guys are the name of your group it's a fireside chats young and when does your new a diverse or come out every day what\nThere's a certain irony chalk that these folks on the committee judicial committee or people like Blumenthal was wide time and time again about his service in Vietnam Cory Booker who's admitted admitted in the past\nThat he's grilled women along the way and there's two or three other guys by the way that have done some pretty nasty stuff to what is sort of ironic that these are the folks that are making the moral poll on Brett Kavanaugh no\nI I Know a name yeah I've got a year that'd be called on that part you know look at me that\n... you know but look at our entire political culture starting the president on this one so you know there there's not a lot of honor on on this project\nHere but let me tell you something that you're there\nBy the FBI of a step back and forth is I find it interesting that ... and it's a gag that the typical I'm finding bipartisan pockets here but Democrats or the FBI report released or you know all these raw materials or at least\nI'm On there but of course and I'm going to say no and Republicans weren't all the wrong FBI material on the Russia probe and Carter Page and all that Democrats day now\nThe fact that had some consistency here you don't release Ron the reports that that's why there's a lot of an proven allegations in rock record and the reason they want the ... the reports that they are to introduce new and your window and judge Canada let's talk with the new and you remember\nReally usa and Chuck Todd from eight to personal liberty and said show\nIt seems like we've gone from a also this the sex assault charges\nWhich I think the Democrats have pretty much given up on ... although they're going to use it in the streets in ... when they protest I Believe in ... they're even going back to that but\nWe got from that too he lied about booming and the devil's triangle and also that he was a stumbling drunk which by the way is triggered me because I think it's a a slur against my Irish people but anyway I mean that's where we're at\nNow look I think the the most if they're going to criticize him and I think the bulk legitimate criticism was the temperament and how we responded\nAnd the partisanship what I always believe that the problem with this nomination the reason it was going to be more heated and and you know this is where I have some dispute with some of my Republican friends on that they said a democratic would have been this angry no matter who the nominee was\nAnd I need some Democrats would have been\nBut I think Kavanaugh was a special case because it can stop and I think in the same way that the words Robert board can trigger a conservative\nLook that the words of Ken Starr can trigger and that's a good point you know and and I think that the\nI think that it angered Chuck Schumer wanted to destroy cabin on two thousand five wafer got appointed to the to the federal bench and remember the whole thing was about Ken Starr so you know that it's been\nYou know that it's been the sort of salt in the world as far as the less concerned and I think that's why the anger is a little extra\nOnly ask you this you know when the when I got into a shouting match with somebody or a nobody as you don't shout at ...\nAnd you're right I don't ... I don't know but not nobody will be show results loud when Donald Trump was that his rally a couple of days ago and he was repeating\nWhat Dr Ford hide said not just you know me and burning very sensitive to Dr Ford we both think she wants to do something but there's been zero to ... I mean you will to tell us was Brett Kavanaugh when Donald Trump is on his rowdy\nWe both agree it was stupid which he's done them listen\nHe said stupid things a million times but we didn't find him to be mocking her he was in ... he didn't put on a baby voice or a female voice he was just stating the patch and the patch far but every time she was asked a question of significance she had no ...\nYeah well the ... look\n... look this is one of those where I think women and men are two different there and I think I can only say that trust me I've heard from a lot of women on that what\nWhat what would that the argument that many women heard on that it hey that's the problem here sometimes I don't remember if you're not gonna remember every detail now he's making it that much harder for someone\nThat is one thing and I'm the one thing not every detail she don't ...\nI think we are this is one where I think this is the gender divide that that I think that no matter what we say or think I think a woman here's\nWhat you know anyone that heard there from all of a ... as you know the Trump won the white women vote so I don't know if it's a along gender lines that necessarily Chuck Todd I'm you may be right you may be wrong I don't know what ... what year alleging there might be addict or do I I I mean I just\nSay exactly I I you know but you see what I'm saying is that I'm certainly many women have heard something differently and and I think it it it it is it's actually a good story in the Boston Globe today about how this um this debate has\nSparked a lot of debate inside marriages and I you know and I read it with very interest because it has in mind too and my wife's shared some stories and she's never shared with me before ... and I'm and I'm I'm sure I'm not alone I'm sure plenty of\nYour husband's out there as it is interesting conversations among very tough conversation so I'm I'm very divisive conversations I get it\nThis is why I personally I Can't wait for the story\n[laughter] with your believing light one quick sixty seconds to go another story comes out this week I'm bashing Trump basically\nGod rest his father sold Freddie gave him sixty one million not one million ah they continue to ... to dodge taxis\nOr you know these are they give them a billion dollars I mean all these numbers that came out this week that basically said Trump ties allied all along about what his father gave him and basically his parents made their fortune by dodging taxes\nI just I Can't believe all every single week chopped there's a story about this guy even as dead father to try to you know the deal Jim ice Donald Trump\nWell it was a it it it ... the Donald Trump well has always been something you know I Would say that he has invited the scrutiny on its own well\nWhen he said things that are just ... about it as well so I think and I hear what you're saying and and I think Trump supporters did see that for the ... and I get why they see it as a firearm but I'm there as well\nIs invited the scrutiny because he's denied like OK pi on that front hey look I think that it was a more nuanced picture it's not clear he broke any law and I think that that ... and and and if he didn't break block people might be outright why why aren't they illegal well that's something that huge\nEverybody should take up with people when it comes to that attack locked in the country because the tax laws are\nGone in such a way where if you're wealthy you can figure it out and if you're not you're going to get screwed\nThe amateur simple from Chuck Todd meet the press is going to be a role to this weekend with this vote tomorrow around five o'clock in the afternoon a Chuck Todd on meet the press you can only covered all on
