it is now the raw right if the allegation is the only evidence that is needed and that's what\nThe left and the Democrats have been trying to sell the American public but the allegation is enough and if you don't believe the allegation if you ask or evidence that evidence is what how you will come to your to your decision than you are viewed as a rapist enabler\nMhm I mean that that is that's the

Missouri dealership in New Jersey\nYour life hasn't been one big mistake here's how everything's sort of fits together so it's it's kinda the same concept of you go to heaven you mean by people who explained your life to you only this time it's the little girl and she wanted to push me to say\nAnd that he's a great guys a veteran and he actually find out in this book how the captain died something that I get shut haunted him for so many many years right\n... yeah it was based on an old uncle of mine and real guy Eddie who was the first guy told me anything about heaven he he was one of these you know I talk like that you know or the feeder T shirts but he took 'em in for dinner so there was a show and and he told me a story when I was a kid that he had he he had a death experience or on the operating\nTable and it came out of his body and he lifted above me look down and he saw the doctors and then he saw dead relatives waiting for him at the edge of the bed while and so I was as a kid I'd say what would you do what you do and he said\nI Do I told them get the hell out of here I'm not ready for any you yet and apparently you're scared them right back to him and I went back in his body but I always thought that that is what happens you meet people yeah that must be 'cause my uncle when lie to me you know and so I always thought that that's what happens when you go to have and so that's how the first book came about and that so it follows up in the next\n... well for people like me and Bernie we want you to write another book what about the folks that aren't going to have\nWhat's in store for us the twenty people you mean now that this is making a big assumption its album ya that question you\nMeet in heaven but it does the next person you meet in heaven to Eddie and the ... will who any meet in heaven including Eddie and ... what Eddie did in the war I mean it takes an incredible waste I won't give it away but it's very very powerful is what it is and there are folks go out and get it the next person you meet and having a novel by Mitch album\nIt's got to be on the New York times bestseller list forever again\nIf you're telling the truth I can go home no you shouldn't do it it's almost always a nice guy and he's humble\nWe know sports guys very well but I was a sports car my whole career if I did this dream job with Bernie starting three years ago and the truth is we don't have a lot of debts we yell and scream about nonsense we just do a we act like was smarter than most people but we're not you you know the ... story dying avail as beautiful book\nOf these two books beautiful books you mature album have this incredible amount of spirituality I mean this sincerely that is that is like nobody else in our business that I Know that goes above and beyond what the lions going to win a football game\nWell Jim horrible it's going to fix things with the Wolverine so it was something in you that makes you a very special person\nWell that's very kind of you to say I keep waiting for the kicker\nAt the end of it and you I mean you and your wife run an orphanage in Haiti forgot I mean that's a I mean you get back that's that's what that's what he's trying to say\nWell you're very kind to say that but I Want to be candid you know I wasn't always this way I mean for the first up till I was thirty seven years old and I saw more sports on television dying from Lou Gehrig's disease so I was in vicious as they come I spent all my time chasing\nTrying to become the best sports broadcaster writer in the world I work Seventeen jobs I spent three days a week and ESPN up in Bristol in our\nNew grow up with a ... mile in Detroit yeah him and me were best at I hung out you've got his ... across the country but uh you know then\nI happened to see this old college professor of mine who I was really close with in college and had lost touch with never even called him because I was so ambitious yeah and all of a sudden he's on television talking sixteen years or than sixteen years\nNow what was your on Nightline that night talking about a unless\nHe was talking about dying because he had made a thing about uh he was going to teach his last class to his former students out there about what it's like to die\nAnd Ted Koppel heard about this came up to an interview I happen to be watching TV I happen to flip on room controlled there's this guy who was a really close professor of mine for four years I mean I took every class he offered to you know I wrote my honor's thesis with him everything and here he is talking about what it's like the die\nAnd I felt so guilty that you know I I I called him was going to be one phone call and then it kind of guilt at me into coming to see him as I'll come see it'll be one visit right and then once during the two and two to three and and and\nHe ended up telling me at one point that the thing he feared the most with this disease wasn't the debt or the the the debt he was going to leave his family because he had amassed all these debts of dying for two years and you know one way to pay for it\nSo I got the idea that maybe I could write a book thousand page bills and honestly guy for all the nice things you're saying that was really the first like kind of selfless thing that I had done in my life that didn't involve ambition or anything\nLike that only seven years your jerk and then you became one of them and I\nI wrote that book and you know nobody wants to publish it came I remember I went around here in New York and was address sports right and it was gonna want to read a book about you and a professor and we finally found one publisher they gave us the money I gave all the money to him to pay its bills and I was going back to\nSports writing I mean I was heading right back to my old life and then the book took off really the only reason and it's sort of taking me on this whole other path so\nNo swell life happens it's an incredible I mean if you went predisposed to be the person you are today you you would never become that but there wasn't a very humble Mitch album on the Joseph ... VIP guess was on the Bernie and said show the the new book is called the next person you meet in heaven it's a sequel of course of the five people you meet in heaven as we talked about and what's very telling\nMitch album is that uh I mean with all your success\nYou still a stick true to you will do you live in Detroit I mean a lot of people would have just packed up and not come to the big city here and you know you stay right\nThey don't mean that is nice but is that we don't have a blue ribbon filming filled out as an ice where I live I guess what it's like an old Bloomfield Hills will say that that's\nWhere the auto executive live I don't live there [laughter]\nI live in the same house that I Lived there when I went through this was more a thought even why same life same everything's All right and that\nThat's very that says a lot at least moved to Ann Arbor it's beautiful I Want I have always told me about Ann Arbor or just from local stuff for you\nOr Michigan Wisconsin coming up on Saturday Night and they did cover against Maryland last week that's big [laughter]\nBut what really is going on with a with Jim horrible he has been he can't beat a good team he's been it's really been a miserable higher if we're going to be honest Mitch up to this point Miserables probably be strong but not as one sex against Penn State and Ohio State knows what he's won almost\nEvery other game has he hasn't delivered what they've asked to do and this is this the stretch here now Wisconsin and then he's got Michigan State for a week which is always hard and got Ohio State at the end there there was a bit of a way to buy the Michigan State yeah ... this year yeah but uh I don't know you know the funniest thing about him is that he's a great was a great quarterback\nHe's kind of a quarterback who any hasn't been able to get a quarterback to come to Michigan since he's been there for Ohio State one quarterback goes down another all American steps up\nNotre Dame one quarterback goes down another on America's this kid shape Patterson is brutal but he's also a transfer and I mean it doesn't even recruited me out to get them from a transfer so until he gets a really bona fide super star quarterback and it does what loose saving does with Nick Saban does whether you've got ten quarterbacks on the roster he goes to one to the second\nUh he's I don't think they're going to win big and uh I'm not sure they're going to win this game against Wisconsin they're they're they're good but they're not great\nMitch album the book again the next person you meet in heaven or a from Detroit and under sportscaster from Detroit of course as everybody knows but to sit brought this to my attention needs to tiger the Detroit Tigers broadcasters get into these\nYeah oh yeah they actually get it was so proud of that ad that they've been fired\nWell this fight in what's it look at it this way if you had to broadcast the tigers\nAt some point you're going to snap and apparently\nThey snapped a like it was either before game or after a game and they they came to blows yeah and so then the sad thing is that was the most action that tiger [laughter]\nWe're a pretty bad baseball\n... it's a rough go the pistons damned van gundy did not work out the red wings is is that Scotty Bowman driveway no no no the lions are okay and the tigers stunk well you know you're in trouble when you're lions or your best to light [laughter] this is not as this down\nTime in my choice of course we do however feel good that we've managed to feed\nOur entire former team to uh other ... other contenders forgot World Series so we have just a burly under pitching for Houston thanks very much we had a half of the Detroit a half of the Boston Red Sox\nGuys yeah sunny cuts all a well I Know that's bad around here including they've done Brodsky David and browse because the reason that all that that report cello was there and said you must have seen is is there a private prices there to guide [laughter] so ah yeah we watched the whole team go to other cities or the luggage\nYou instead of selling out that you use it out on the guy makes album is a great guy get his book the next person you meet in heaven go to Amazon dot com just get it today it's gonna\nIt's inspirational it's powerful partly got clinics where are you a chance to say thank you very much ... ... it was fun to have a good man which I'll\nSit on the seventies ABC [noise]\nSeven W crawfish\nBusy morning from the ... dot com traffic center I Am ... west bound Westchester evidence\nAccident at three

side of the street parking rules and regulations for the regime dot com traffic center I'm ... I'm Seventy seven WABC channel seven's bill Evans with the forecast\nI think that the um there's a lot of feeling here that FDR ton of allowed this thing to go on I'm Talking about one of them to not post when the book is about trying to capture all these guys but\nFDR knew very well what was going on he knew Jews are being murdered every every single day and he basically sat around for a long time and did nothing about it yet he's federal did today as one of the great presidents the guy that stop the war blah blah blah\nBut a lot of Jewish people believe that he sat idly by us we were being slaughtered every single day\nWell I don't know if that's entirely fair um the the report Taj coming out of Germany with scant uh the Germans control the information flow out of time magazine um from Nineteen thirty eight were Heinrich handlers on the\nCover wow it's heroin chief\nAnd there's an ... big article about him and in the article it doesn't make much mention of uh the Holocaust which was not white underway at that point the Holocaust started in earnest in Nineteen forty one forty two\nUm but surely there were signs with but in America FDR was dealing with a split population\nHalf didn't want to get involved with any foreign war after World War one and half dead and you know a FDR the ultimate politician and then of course at the Japan which had an alliance with Hitler bombed bombed us then the war started\nUm I did a FDR know what was going on he knew that Hitler and his henchmen hated Jews everybody knew that oh you had to do is read mine cop\nBut I don't think he knew the systemic system that they set up under Adolf Eichmann Eichmann was the architect of that and the fact that he got away for Twenty years and it's amazing and here's another tack you got to remember a few weeks ago that there was somebody in Queens of a concentration guard a camp\nGuard that was deported yeah remember that story after that they finally found him sixty Seventy years Seventy years after after the fact there was a woman living in San Francisco a concentration camp guard for fifty years Fifteen Years she married an American Jew ...\nYeah and this this isn't a book by the way\nYeah and and a finally found her deported or to Germany where she's still alive and get this she get the U.S Social Security check every month unbelievable\nIt really is somebody really is a Bill O'Reilly ... says I'm telling you ...\nIt's it's a suspense reads like a suspense novel killing the assets like Bill O'Reilly go to Amazon dot com go anywhere to get the book it's going to be it's gonna be a great reason that if I read and it's shocking one at that bill let me pivot if you if you'll allow me to a\nChurch or some topical or politics or the Senate we'd just witness to earn did to sort of lord of the flies the past month and you had this big battle well the Lynch mob justice versus due process and I think due process one but you have some thoughts about accountability if I'm not mistaken\nWell you know the message of the day on Bill O'Reilly dot com yesterday was that some of these things that happened in the Kavanaugh hearings cannot be ignored and two main things number one the government has to find out who leak that letter from Dr Ford\nBecause Dr Ford in her um team claims they never wanted to go public that they used the Congress to send a letter accusing having all but they did not want her to be put in the Firestone okay\nSo we believe them All right yeah you know and you say it unless there's evidence for the obvious ...\nSo it's leaked out there's only two people who got her congresswoman from California and Dianne Feinstein\nThat's all that's all who had it\nSo some on there and you're telling me the FBI can't find that out and find it out of All right so you figure that would they find that out and about\nAn hour and a half that's number one number two you have Dianne Feinstein the senator from California holding things back for six weeks the letter back for six weeks in dropping it just it the last moment to disrupt the cabin or confirmation that's politics right okay\nThe Senate Ethics committee\nShould be investigating this Feinstein and finding out why she how little letter back for six weeks when she could have given it to the Senate Judiciary committee or and or the FBI and this thing could have been responsibly responsibly dealt with instead of the Lynch mob\nAnd all the chaos that we had no classes are those are the two things that I like to see happen\nOkay sixty seconds we got to run Bill O'Reilly again the book killing the assessment amazing bulk everybody's got a theory everybody's got an opinion Bill O'Reilly why do you think Nikki Haley resigned yesterday\nNo idea really as you know now we have fifty five seconds\nLeft [laughter]\nThat's funny you know me I don't speculate\nOn these things you know I Know a lot of people do and that's why I don't even watch cable news anymore it's all speculation I have no blank an idea maybe she wants to go back home now South Carolina she's tired of being in New York traffic I don't\nKnow why she says she did a good job you know
