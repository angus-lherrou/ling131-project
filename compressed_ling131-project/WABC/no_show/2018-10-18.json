the ... are you going to be late with your rent huh Bernard they know that you're going to be like you know when these guys\nCome to our way to say I've been late [laughter] but here's the thing that's back to a shaken hands with John Gotti junior I mean let let's face it I did a me I'm going to put a negative spin on it you sold out for a vote or they say oh\nHere's an Irish guy telling me this guy came in the whole right you're Irish immigrant outgoing person Democrat Democrat yes the apartment\nAnd went to ... once they voted Democrat if he tried to kill me then you you uh\nTake younger I think of the people come up to me is how did you do that you guys really hate each other sleep he tried to kill you twice I said hey you think I don't know but not only that he\nWounded you grievously just six months ago your at your pain you were in you know when you haven't even your I mean it was ... you saw it but I thought you were going to die in Brooklyn cycle night with me I really did some party that walks around and thinking it's a badge of honor that you tried to that the the the this mob family tried to have you whack no\nNo no we're not I'm not like a one of the home boys you know who to you know they're constantly picking their shirts up as a sign of men who look how many times they get ... and that's what the let me say with me Brownsville east New York's other let me see the poodle Zoe\nThis group it's a hate group and like I said law enforcement better get their arms around this thing because you're going to see a different reaction from people who want to attend a Trump rally who want to attend any kind of a patriot ... bought in Portland\nOr the situation in New York that is a constitutionally protected right to engage in a political activities and it's being denied by anti ... shows up not to counter protests these are not counterprotesters there is not a counter demonstration become\nLooking for confrontation this was a civil rights violation and I'd like to see more people go to the department of justice in their state and after the ... civil rights criminal investigation be conduct as we can identify these guys in a criminal\nYou know sort of have a car to take what you said a step further you say there has not been one Democrat\nThat as denounced these people in fact it's been a complete in Texas is they've actually called for some of this weather with Kirsten Gillibrand Eric Holder Maxine Waters we've got a bunch of examples of politicians on the left\nThat I've actually call are they selling punching this type of violence\nYes they are and and shame on them you know and then they then they have the nerve to\nUh be offended and I'm Glad that people are starting in the media are starting to an on our side of the right side of the conservative side when I see right through the political rights are calling this uh this band subs all for what they are it's a mob this mob violence and that's starting to get under the skin\nIf you've noticed of of Democrats in the left leaning I'm liberal media who doesn't like the term but that's what these guys are so we have to frame this words matter near you guys know that\nWords matter and you have to frame this properly if you don't frame it properly do apply the wrong remedies which is why I said when I see people starting to defend themselves\nAgainst the sort of political violence I'm encouraged by this I don't advocate for ... for violence but do advocate for self defense of people have a right it's a God given right to defend themselves when they were attacked by jak voted folks\nYes they are the equivalent really the brown shirts the Nazi brown shirts back in the thirties essentially now I Want to ask you this sheriff David plucked as a black conservative\nI have to ... what did you think of the reaction to Kanye West a visit to the White House particularly CNN's Don Lemon and this uh do carry cell is that this is what happens when a when negroes don't read I mean this was to me was\nHighly offensive\nShameful it really is and but see there's those words you guys mangoes somebody list or Spain or with somebody and they like to call it the left of wandering off the plantation I did it a decade ago probably Fifteen Years ago other people have done and wandered off the plantation of liberal ideology and liberal politics\nThey have to send out henchmen to go out and recapture that individual because that individual is dangerous while they're doing their free thinking like I've been doing like Fifteen Years and others are starting to develop the courage to do so the Democratic party doesn't want free thinkers\nI Want ... so what they do is they get surrogates they get\nA they give a certain people and she was the black people license to go out and attack these individuals on the reason why they have to get black circuits so they can they can't be accused of of being a racist using terms like\nYou know a run away in the growing house negro and things like that that's how this thing works\nSo it was typical when I when I saw the reaction that this phone Don Lemon barked at the wrong tree trying to take me on on national TV ... um you know but he he's the kind of guy that that is recruited by the Democratic party by these these liberals\nTo go out and try to be here and and and and hopefully drag this guy back\nOnto the plantation and deliver a severe beating I'm Talking about metaphorically not only to teach him a lesson but also to teach any any other black that's going to consider becoming a free thinker going out there on their own that this will happen to you if you try it\nLike they bought the wrapping up here ... ... one more question for you or the big bottle has become\nTiny versus horse race obviously you're a big Trump supporter very big Trump supporter blocked I even some of his biggest supporters were all big critical of Trump hauling Stormy Daniels horse face yesterday what are your thoughts on the president's latest tweet [laughter]\nFor us to\nDrop I Love his style I Love his bravado you know when you poke the dog and ... and and you know people don't I mean by that left what do you call them are also dog when you poke the dog a Trump that big dog will bite\nSo that's what these people are gonna have to learn if they don't like it I say if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen you should see what ... calls me\nAll like I said well what do they what they said back in the day speaking of a black conservatives what they said about Colin Powell and ... just disgusting stuff but sheriff David clock we are at a time you're the senior advisor in spokesmen for America first action\nI'd love to see you in the act of God with Michael ...
