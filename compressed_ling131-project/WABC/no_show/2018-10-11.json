I spent three days a week and ESPN up in Bristol in our new grow up with a ... mile in Detroit him and me we\nWere best friends anyway I hung out you've got his trailer or we're running out but uh you\nKnow then I happened to see this old college professor of mine who I was really close with in college and had lost touch with never even called him because I was so ambitious yeah and all of a sudden he's on television talk in the sixteen years uh than sixteen years\nNow what was your on Nightline that night talking about a unless\nHe was talking about dying because he had made a thing about uh he was going to teach his last class to his former students out there about what it's like to die\nAnd Ted Koppel heard about this came up to new people I happen to be watching TV I happen to flip on room controlled there's this guy who was a really close professor of mine for four years I mean I took every class he offered to you know I wrote my honor's thesis with him everything and here he is talking about what it's like to die\nAnd I felt so guilty that you know I I I called him was going to be one phone call and then it kind of guilt immune to coming to see him as I'll come see you'll be one visit right and then once during the two and two to three and and and\nHe ended up telling me at one point that the thing he feared the most with this disease wasn't the death was the the debt he was going to leave his family because he had amassed all these debts of you dying for two years and you know one way to pay for it\nSo I got the idea that maybe I could write a book thousand page bills and honestly guys for all the nice things you're saying that was really the first like kind of selfless thing that I had done in my life that didn't involve ambition or anything\nLike that only seven years your jerk and then you became there's one writer and I I wrote that book and you know nobody wants to publish it and it\nCame I remember coming around here in New York and was address sports right and it was gonna want to read a book about you and the professor\nAnd we finally found one publisher they gave us the money I gave all the money to pay its bills and I was going back to sports writing I mean I was heading right back to my old life and then the book took off really the only reason and it's sort of taking me on this whole other path so\nSlow lights up and it's an incredible I mean if you were predisposed to be the person you are today you you would never become that but there wasn't a very humble Mitch album on the Joseph ... VIP guess list\nOn the Bernie and said show the the new book is called the next person you meet in heaven it's a sequel of course of the five people you meet in heaven as we talked about what's very telling Mitch album\nIs that uh I mean with all your success\nYou still a stick true do you do you live in Detroit I mean a lot of people would have just packed up and not come to the big city here and uh but you know you stay right they don't mean that is nice but is\nThat we don't have a developing filled out as an ice saying you don't live I guess what if I could hold Bloomfield Hills I guess that's where the auto executives live I don't live\nThere [laughter] I live in the same house\nThat I Lived in Tuesday's with ... I thought even why same life same everything's All right and that's\nVery that says a lot at least moved to hit all birds futile I have always told me about in Arbor or just some local stuff for you\nOr Michigan Wisconsin coming up on Saturday Night and they did cover against Maryland last week such big [laughter] but what really is going on with ah with Jim horrible he has been he can't be a good team he spent it's really been a miserable higher if we're going to be honest Mitch\nUp to this point Miserables probably strong but not as someone sex against Penn State and Ohio State knows what he's won almost every other game it sort of it has he hasn't delivered what they've asked him to do and this is this the stretch here now Wisconsin and then he's got Michigan State route one week which is always hard and got Ohio State at the end there there was a bit overweight about Michigan State yeah ... ... yeah\nBut uh I don't know you know the funniest thing about him is that he's a great was a great quarterback\nHe's kind of a quarterback who any hasn't been able to get a quarterback to come to Michigan since he's been there for Ohio State one quarterback goes down another all American steps up\nNotre Dame one quarter back all that and other all America's this kid shape Patterson is brutal but he's also a transfer and I mean it couldn't have been recruited me out to get them from a transfer so until he gets a really bona fide super star quarterback and it does what loose saving does with Nick Saban does when you've got ten quarterbacks on the rocks or he goes to one to the second\nUh he's I don't think they're going to win big and uh I'm not sure they're going to win this game against Wisconsin there there there are good but they're not great\nMitch album the book again the next person you meet in heaven or a from Detroit and to a new sports caster from Detroit of course as everybody knows but to sit brought this to my attention needs to tiger the Detroit Tigers broadcasters get into these\nYeah oh yeah I actually got it was so proud of that I I Know they've been fired well this fight is what's it look at it this way if you had to broadcast the tigers at some point you're going to snap and apparently they snapped\nA like it was either before game or after a game and they they came to blows yeah and so then the sad thing is that was the most action that tiger [laughter]\nWe're a pretty bad baseball\n... it's a rough go the pistons Danville Gandhi did not work out the red wings is is that Scotty Bowman right wing oh no no the lions are okay and the tigers stunk\nWell you know you're in trouble when you're lions or your best to light [laughter] this is not this is down time in a choice of course we do however feel good that we've managed to feed\nOur entire former team to uh other ... other contenders forgot World Series so we have just a brilliant are pitching for Houston thanks very much we have half of the Detroit or having the Boston Red Sox\nI Try yeah if any ... well I Know it's bad around here including they've done Brodsky David and browse because the reason that all that that report cello was there and said you must have seen is is there a ... prices they're two guys [laughter] so ah yeah we watched our whole team go to other cities\nOr they'll look at you instead of selling out you use to do it I'm the guy which album is

Hitler and his henchmen hated Jews everybody knew that oh you had to do is read mine cop\nBut I don't think he knew the systemic system\nThat they set up under Adolf Eichmann Eichmann was the architect of that\nAnd the fact that he got away for Twenty years it's amazing and here's another fact you've got to remember a few weeks ago\nThat there was somebody in Queens a concentration guard a camp guard that was deported member that story under that they finally found him sixty Seventy years Seventy years after after the fact there was a woman\nLiving in San Francisco a concentration camp

get this she gets a U.S Social Security check every month unbelievable\nIt really is something that really is a Bill O'Reilly killing me as this I'm telling you it's it's the suspense it reads like a suspense novel killing the U.S that's like Bill O'Reilly go to Amazon dot com go anywhere to get the book it's going to be it's going to be a great read it at a flying read and it's shocking one at that\nBill let me pivot if you if you'll allow me to a\nChurch or some topical or politics or the Senate we'd just witness to earn did to sort of lord of the flies the past month and you had this big battle well the Lynch mob justice versus due process and I think due process one but you have some thoughts about accountability if I'm not mistaken\nWell you know the message of the day on Bill O'Reilly dot com yesterday was that some of these things that happened in the Kavanaugh hearings cannot be ignored\nAnd two main thing is number one the government has to find out who leak that letter from Dr Ford\nBecause Dr Ford and her um team claims they never wanted to go public that they used the Congress to send a letter accusing Kavanaugh but they did not want her to be put in the Firestone okay\nSo we believe them All right yeah ... you know and you say it unless there's evidence or the obvious ...\nSo it's leaked out there's only two people got it her congresswoman from California and Dianne Feinstein\nThat's all that's all who had it so some on\nThere and you're telling me the FBI can't find that out and find it out of All right so you figure that would they find that out and about\nAn hour and a half that's number one number two you have Dianne Feinstein the senator from California holding things back for six weeks the letter back for six weeks in dropping it just it the last moment to disrupt the cabin or confirmation that's politics right okay\nThe Senate Ethics committee\nShould be investigating this Feinstein and finding out why she how little letter back for six weeks when she could have given it to the Senate Judiciary committee or and or the FBI and this thing could have been responsibly responsibly dealt with instead of the Lynch mob\nAnd all the chaos that we had no classes are those are the two things that I like to see happen\nOkay sixty seconds we got to run below widely again the book killing the yes that's an amazing book everybody's got a theory everybody's got an opinion Bill O'Reilly why do you think Nikki Haley resigned yesterday\nNo idea really as you know now we have fifty five seconds\nLeft [laughter]\nThat's funny you know me I
