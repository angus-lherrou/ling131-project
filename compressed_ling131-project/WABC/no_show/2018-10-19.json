get the hell out of Louisiana\n[laughter] well I just got back on us Lenny that's very funny look look look how well you have done and then right now\nDown to Brazil former DNC chair but you have a book out and it's called for colored girls who have considered politics and it's about among other things are above black female politicians am I correct none of\nIt's it's about women who dared to make a difference it's our journey for a women who have worked in democratic politics for the last Thirty years\nWe describe our journey working on a Jesse Jackson campaigned being inspired by women like credit Scott Kang Dorothy Height and that the Maya Angelou in Sicily tightened who by the way showed up at the ... or a couple of nights ago\nTo celebrate our book I had Thomas by the way it was also in the crowd when we came through New York so it's it's really about women who dared to make a difference and taken out to the political\nTejpal most shows Clinton going to tell you one of the ladies and you know very well do you work closely with actually during the last election she um she said something a couple of days ago about how to really upset you of being but you want to gym improved for women down and do a very good job with that\nAnd ... who will do do spouse I'm married twenty six years I Can't imagine what my wife has to say every day just to protect me I get it\nBut when Hillary Clinton comes out and talks about each\nOther as to whether or not Bill Clinton used his power to seduce Monica Lewinsky that was one of the dumbest and most responsible comments I've ever heard and quite frankly Donald Hillary should know better\nWell you know let me just say this um and I I was\nThere Twenty years ago not in the marriage not in the White House but I was there Twenty years ago when the American people educated what happened inside the oval office\nBill Clinton had to apologize to his wife to his daughter Chelsea but he also had to apologize to Monica the American people he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice\nI Would hope that we would uh spending time more time focusing on how we are getting along as as as Americans and not a particularly going back to someone's married I think it must be painful for her to continue to talk about this\nAnd to be able to to try to sort this out in the public when it was a such a private or deal and improperly and embarrass\nOkay who was a very public or do we bring our our homes have done it but the\nPublic for or you can imagine what happened between the two of them you you think\nShe or he went home that night and say honey I got something to say to you what she said well honey I've already seen it I've heard it let me tell you what I have come a ... it's been twenty is it it's it's personal and I'm sure it's it's grueling I've never had an opportunity to talk to\nA you know senator a Secretary Clinton uh about this a privately are publicly but ah when whenever I see if she wins says and then she speaks her true below whether it's a lot of Trump in the White House dealing with what she had to deal with over the last couple of years with all of the ... and all of the conversations\nStormy Daniels writing a book a Hillary Clinton we need to give these women opportunity to speak their truth tell that story respect them and then move on\nWell speaking of ah women telling the truth or done to Brazil and it is about women in politics the book is called for colored girls who have considered politics\nYou can do go to Amazon did did it right now for colored girls who have considered politics that you had to Hillary Clinton has said well what does it just mentioned\nAnd also a blues Warren's a disastrous DNA story all this coming just before the election not exactly what the Democrats looking for a two and a half weeks three weeks out the ... from the midterms right\nThe funny thing is that I watch Ted Cruz and be it'll all work a debate the other night and you know what\nNo one is talking about the Elizabeth Warren's DNA no one is talking about or anything other than kitchen table issues whether or not their premiums will go up health care is a big issue this year while the economy is doing good there's still some communities that are suffering\nPeople want to talk about kitchen table issues they're not interested in is what I call the beltway enlist uh to uh partisanship and gossip\nYou may be running who talked to was a poll taken no just yesterday that said although the issues coming up for the midterms Thirteen percent health care is still the largest is the biggest issue and quite frankly are the Republicans ... you know they spent all these years yelling complaining about Obamacare which I don't like either by the whites\nBut if you're going to complain about it or at least we'll be able to do something with it and the truth is not the Republicans have not so in this big issues that does in fact maybe bode well for the Democrats\nLet me tell you something my hundred and thirty two million of us have some pre existing condition whether asthma\nA cancer diabetes you name it we need to strengthen our health care system we should not be one paycheck away from bankruptcy if we go to the doctor and learned that we have an element we need to have the better health care and the world I'm tired of the United states\nBeing a a lack of when it comes to health care and protect and what I Believe to be the health of all of its citizens we need to do that by the way when you have extra money in the bank you try to make some improvement in your life\nAnd try to go out and say okay well you know I got a couple of extra dollars a month to get some storm whether I got a couple of extra dollar them fix that garage door or whatever but\nHere in this country when we get a surplus you know we do we we blow it next year we're going to have to raise the debt ceiling again because the tax\nCuts that we couldn't afford it gonna blow up big a big hole in the deficit we need to focus on our priorities I Would hope that if the Democrats are able to take back the house the Senate whatever we're still we're so far in the wilderness we we just have to take a cabin okay\nTo happen and we need something right what\nIf we take that something we need to fight for the American people strengthen our health care system strengthen Social Security and Medicare we need to do something to make sure all of our children have a decent education that's what I'm about that's what I've always been about\nWell and that's a good message has done to Brazil the book again is called for colored girls were considered politics and speaking of a couple of extra dollars\nYeah unemployment rate at historic lows right now the fifty years anyway a three point seven historic lows were African American money in the bank and the message I may resonate that the job is ... which is better than any democratic social program that ever came out of Congress\nJobs not moms could be the Republican slogan this year and that my uh the the older woman with them\nWell if we can get rid of the culture of corruption I mean the president promised to drain the swamp and all that he got some some new mountains around I\nRemember he must have had a reporter there at the documentary I at the look and what I what I said to the reporter but I think what I said that the reporter is let's not be hypocritical I was also bringing up the ice in our situation where the president lied and said that they use to spy plane was a weather balloon 'cause they thought the pilot was dead\nAnd they figured there was no evidence or the fact that we're shooting you to spy planes over the Soviet Union which could have caused a nuclear\nWar now that didn't make it that didn't make it to the column okay okay so then what would they would they said was they several as you said you've been to Saudi Arabia about seven times and let's not being naive here everybody we know these folks play rough [noise]\nYeah that's absolutely true but I but I think I also said they play rough it's a rough neighborhood and so you've got to be very careful you know what the president\nIs really not going to go after these guys as hard as some of these journalists wanted to so I said absolutely got a call them out and absolutely you have to figure out what to do as it relates to some level of sanctions\nBecause you have to always split the baby in a situation like this but I don't I don't think that we we have an eighty five eighty or positive relationship with Saudi Arabia\nUnfortunately they control twenty five percent of the world's oil reserves\nOr your three hundred and thirty five million citizens your population your comedy is tied to the oil markets whether we like it or not and so you know the rough\nUh we've been rough uh I think he probably left this out as well the United states sanctions the assassination of a democratically elected leader and Iran both day Nike fifty three\nUh we also John Kennedy two weeks before he died he sanction the assassination of the south Vietnamese president\nAnd so we can pretend that word we haven't been in the game or ever been in the game\nBut we have been in the game and so my my point to whoever put that at the paper I Love the way journalist cookie cut things but my point was hey there is a real is I'm going on in this society now you've got somebody with an iPhone they didn't even get them into a ... give a salad so for our listeners what's this give your\nCell phone your iPhone all of that stuff even materialize you can't really use them to transmit to receive\nAnd they killed this cat before he got in the skin so his iPhone ears I watch is on\nRecording we're in the new age of ... we kept that sugar coat anymore what really goes on in the world because everybody's got a movie studio and the television and a recording studio in their hand so if you want to pretend to stuff has been going on in the world or it's not going to go on fifty years from now we can pretend that\nUh but I I you know I think the president on a good job I have no problem being on the record saying he's got a call them out because he has to call them out he has no choice because you have varying constituencies that are going to have varying opinions but as a leader and as a statesman he's gotta he's gotta worry about the global economy and he's got to worry about a\nMiddle class and he's not going to do much the air whether these people like it or not\nAnd the also you you mentioned the gas prices the jobs here with the ah the arms deals and also uh the geo political a situation with the alliance between Saudi Arabia Jordan the Sunni Israel in us all in a very important so as you point out Anthony Scaramucci\nOn the Bernie and said show caution is the author of the day\nNow I Want to ask you this Anthony you saw the president on sixty minutes speaking of a journalist what they do pick and choose and ah they\nMay make things look like they're not even with the benefit of a editing a CBS in sixty minutes or they had a hard time making the president look bad on Sunday night I think he came off fairly well in a hostile environment\nWell while I applaud his new calms team and bill shine for allowing you to do basically you know you could go to our website Scaramucci communications plant you could see the plan I was going to put a wait\nAnd I basically I applaud them for just allowing him to be him that's what the American people voted for he's a very common sense oriented guy a and so when you get him out there it's it's very hard to distort\nWhat he's doing because he's telling you write to your face what he's going to do what you do it I was laughing at myself\nOn Sunday because he said I thought that the real estate people\nIn New York were rough until I got to this vicious play he's ... the animals down here and and I and I tell my Wall Street friends I Want you to a badge of the worst person that you ever bet on Wall street and you're thirty forty year career at Wall Street got 'em in your mind that step that person and\nWhy [laughter] I have no no that was hilarious and and so now the\nMost vicious there these are the most vicious diabolical animals and by the way they're inside the west wing he knows it I Know it or he even knows who the specific people are at this point\nHe's just having a hard time because we let some of these bozos go Lyndon Johnson said I'd rather have inside the tent teen outside then outside the tent paying into the chat and so he did he they're saying bad I Can't fire some of these guys because they're going to go full ballistic ... made a bitter herbs are coming up ... each\nHe's got wind of it he's up to speed with the fish is as\nThat and he looks like he's enjoying it now whereas you know a year ago or when I was with him in the oval office cheapest all upset about it like what the hell is wrong with these people but he's a very very bad people and this is why the American people do not like these people in Washington fellas it's just the truth right\nOr the interests you know they don't say let's talk about some local politics Anthony of the ... New York post has Andrew Cuomo dressed in a chicken sued because he refuses thirty five days since the primaries\nTo um ... mile an hour all the Republican gubernatorial candidates and he's going to win this thing by a landslide just like ... and other Democrats running in the city\nBut do you think that he has a responsibility in this democratic society to go out there and give modeling are all a chance to tell people why he may be the better choice\n[noise] well I I think he does and I and I think that you know the the woman that ran against if it sticks and he he allowed back at base to happen you know he spent twenty million dollars in the primary because he was very worried about a hard left blue wave tape you hear about\n'em but I think he looks at all in our already says man the guys smart he's articulate good looking guy charismatic\nAnd he doesn't want that lays ... diet minutes of the excess taxes the bloated spent thing that all of that stuff to be highlighted in the debate and we know Richard Nixon said this in his memoirs a big state aid\nWas allowing John Kennedy debate here because it led to the rise of John Kennedy and it led to the uh\nThe realization that hey John Kennedy could hold his own with the vice president of the United states so you know these guys are politicians balance you know you're not surprised that he's wearing the chicken soup this morning I'm just very happy I'm not wearing the tradition\nAnd that's what I was you went into one little factoid I'd point guns at Nineteen Ninety four his dad was running for a third term running against a guy named George Pataki wouldn't debate Pataki\nAnd guess what Pataki one just to keep that in mind if any is there and we'll just rather time here on the Bernie essential but look the movie moves starting Tuesday at Amazon and iTunes the book Trump the blue collar president you get an Amazon dot com right now\nUh so you're doing well you take an S. and we thank you for appearing on the show Anthony\nWell I'm I'm looking for all the guys invite me to the studios I grew up those hats\nYou got back to the United states\nAlready do I get that want to get back I expect to be getting and then like please\nNo doubt it will see a Monday Night ... at the hunt and fish caught for the young yeah the book signing Anthony thank you so much about our eye buddy rank you guys are common you've got to talk with Anthony Scaramucci\nSaid in the morning It's MORNING sixty Seventy seven\nNBC Radio dot [noise]\nSeven W [noise]\nWith issues both ways at George Washington bridge when the ... dot com traffic center I'm ... and again as you travel inbound there's about twenty minutes at least still getting into the toll barrier because the earlier accident that was over Jerome evident now if you're traveling westbound on the cross Bronx some\nPretty big delays getting to the up and George Washington bridge and again this because on that upper level three lanes of luck with some roadwork and that shouldn't be too much longer but still damage done I mean I'm looking this traffic on the Alexander Hamilton\nRich and it has stopped that same thing on the ramp stuff in the major deacon so we got starting to see a pretty big problem here outbound uh George Connecticut Turnpike\nOn the south side exit Nineteen that vehicle fire right and center lines and all and it's out of the street parking rules and regulations again today are in effect for the ... the dot com traffic center I'm Joan on Seventy seven WABC here's channel seven's bill Evans with the forecast today we're back to fall it's going to be sunny\nAnd it's very pleasant actually milder the high is going to be sixty four degrees with those little southwest when a great way to start off and we can now it turns cloudy is mildly or like little fifty four forty four in the suburbs down tomorrow we're going to call this easily by all we got sunshine clouds just before they could be a shower in the morning\nAnd then a front is going to push through tomorrow afternoon and then Saturday Night is going to be chilly who's going to be forty four Sunday windy a quarter again with sunshine clouds\nThe highest going to be right around forty nine and then we might have been some worries on Monday morning northwest it'll be cruel sunshine and higher fifty three this is where the jazz is brought you buy injury die as using DNA testing of blood work who's twenty because he thought it was only forty days now location in white plains\nJust go by five hundred dialogue with the injured by a drunk come this is ... dollars but I was Seventy seven WABC where it comes to talk\nTo your shopping cart", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "New York", "day": "19"}
