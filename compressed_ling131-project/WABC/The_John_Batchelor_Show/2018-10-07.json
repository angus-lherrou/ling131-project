... period across America\nAnd then years later these babies went blind\nBecause no one anticipated that the high level of oxygen to the little babies were early born would cause blindness\nAnd this man is blind all his life because of a new gizmo that doctors and nurses thought was so great\nBut that was on prove it\nAnd so when I talk about new gizmos and there's a lot of kids most out their ... and papas an axis and blah blah blah machines that have no track record\nThat's why here at British or the New York we have a track record with FDA equipment and proven ... over years thousands of

okay one doctor stood up and brought really to you and your loved ones new technology that offered treatment and inside a better care for cancer patients let me tell you about this man who became blind as a baby due to high oxygen well then he developed\nA cancer of his orbit whereas I was once\nAnd he came to us and he'd been at the big hospitals he had a ... going from his ... all the way down to tear ducts deep into his brain\nAnd the doctors want to do radical surgery on him and cut out all the tissues to forming surgery extensive surgery life changing surgery and then the patient came here and we treated the patient here\nWith pinpoint non invasive treatment here and now that mess we just staged up with a new MRI that mass is all gone and it's actually been four years\nFour years later that mess has gone he never needed that radical surgery to forming surgery\nBut the surgeons told them indeed is that the surgeons never told him he could have an option here Thirteen it'd be for Broadway with Dr Lederman they said you have to have this radical performing surgery and the patient was smart the patient knows patients actually a\nRadio listener and probably as this thing right now\nAnd he knows the beauty of radio surgery that we're able to attack the cancer and avoid unnecessary harm of radical surgery hospital stay at the ... and super infection and maybe not even making it through the big operation that was proposed elsewhere\nSo for him thank you for your trust and thank you for four years of good health this is the work we do here at Thirteen eighty four

why don't you check out Dr Lederman so she saw\nThem and she saw them and ready to get treated and then I saw her and I examined her and I\nFound that where they caught on her breast where they did that look back to me was infected and rabbits swollen\nThat none of the doctors and the big hospital had seen the same week it seemed to surgeons and radiation doctors and chemo doctors they also are the same week and know what\nIf they examined or if they examined or which she says they did they never noticed she had a ... of the right breast right where they caught on her\nAnd it was only here where she was examined by a doctor who's triple board certified what his eyes open who you talk to decide you like this and who offered to treat the say allied as\nFirst before getting involved with cancer cure cause cancer treatment might make the sale items get worse and worse and worse\nAnd then she went back to the surgeon who confirmed oh I'm so sorry I missed the diagnosis and do it back to the radiation doctor that big hospital oh I'm so sorry I missed a diagnosis and you're back to the chemo doctor oh I'm so sorry I missed the diagnosis that their leader must you must really be a great doctor\nAnd now the woman this is now months later she's\nWe cleared up to infection we use some radiation on her breasts just seem to be cancer free doing well and she tells me all the other doctors

leading cancer experts treat\nProstate cancer not in the in the first New York but ... you need a brain radio surgery some first in America and in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr leader minute to until like this for a free informative Brooklyn and\nDVD hey Dr Lederman we're back\nWe are back then we are Bob on the line how are you Bob\nHow you doing doctor later when I listen to your program for a very long time and I have a family member or was it was very ill\nSorry to hear that is run by says after ... shows me what question Jeff from me\nOkay we gotta catch it three years and uh I think your hospital or a well known hospital said best place well you'll have to go to cook for care hospice care\nA ... operation decay low\nFat or a live a\nLocked up ... adequate ... issued a point now where he has a\nSomewhere else telling ... cable someplace else and I don't know I listened to your program and I uh I tell ya I Wish it would show when it came to this relative of wine and the very beginning that that's the case\nDoes he have an option\nWell number one look I don't know the patient I don't really judge people without seeing them but I can tell you a few things if one places sending them home to die or hospices with hospice is is to go home to die or go to a facility to die so his doctors of seeing them and understand giving them a lot of treatment over the years\nHave told them to go home to die it means is a choice is probably pretty ominous\nNow the other facility that wants to give him chemo I don't know if they've seen them or not but\nOften a patient who's had a year or two or three years of chemotherapy the cancers already out smarter the chemotherapy so it's not very likely chemotherapy number twenty two thousand is going to be better than chemo number Twenty one thousand\nAnd even if it is chemotherapy doesn't cure anybody with pancreas cancer spread to the liver so if chemotherapy works for a few weeks and it's toxic I don't know that the patient wants to have it\nAnd most likely based on what you've told me that's all the information I have the most likely that cable is not going to help him we might be able to help him we need to see him and his scans of course because radio surgery works differently than chemo came only works generally in one way\nAnd the cancer usually outsmarts that way so the chemo doesn't really have any useful benefit at this point in this man\nIf he's got a master's blocking this bill or a tree micro to open it up is going to match the pack risk causing pain that might be able to shrink that down so we do treat people certain people who have newly diagnosed or recurrent pancreas cancer but would have to see that person\nThat that want to thank you very much and I am going to follow it ... and hopefully it it can make it a point they can see you are welcome\nBack to the climate that the patient has to be agreeable we don't do things it's a patient the patient is the president of the United states of his or her body and we always respect that a family can say whatever they want but I think\nNow he's in a pickle this person and we would fight to get him out of the pickle if he wants if he wants\n... thank you very well God Bless you and thank you for caring about your loved one\nThat we're talking about a a man who flew in from Seattle this week he's eighty one years old and he has a very high risk cancer as a police in a cancer PSA twenty eight so\nGleason is how it looks under the microscope number eight is very aggressive cancer PSA twenty eight is a very aggressive cancer\nHe is eighty one years old is married with a couple of kids and he had the rapidly rising PSA this other man\nHis PSA was being watched watch watch watch watch watch it was three ten years ago went up to twenty eight last year with the police in a cancer it was just to watch and watch and watch the news thinking that it would never happened to him\nShe went back to the same super poop or hospital and the\nDoctors told her this uh this is a woman if you see her walking down the street and say wow what a businesswoman or fancy woman\nThis is a woman who was told she should go in the hospice or take came up for the rest of her life it's another example where the doctors don't give the patient all the options they give the options they want the doctor was selling ... what do you say you could have came all the rest of your life or going hospice to die\nNow what is he trying to do was trying to scare her into taking came all the rest of her life well she's a smart woman she actually how does she get smart she listens to this radio show which is probably listening now\nShe get smart by understanding that doctors have certain motivations that came out Dr yeah it's great to take a forty nine year old otherwise healthy woman and give her came all the rest of her life\nThe average came most ten thousand dollars a month it's great for the doctor and scrape to the hospital is great for the president of the hospital is great for the pharmaceutical industry is great\nFor everybody except for the patient and everybody loved husband\nAnd she came to me we analyzed her case that we saw there's only three novels in the long one nodules blocking the airway and she has a cough and jazz respiratory symptoms\nAnd she hates chemo she's already had so many side effects from chemo she has painted her hands numbness in their hands and painting their feet numbness in her feet\nAnd she said low blood cows they already had to reduce the chemo doses because of their blood counts her bone marrow has been poisoned by the chemo\nAnd they plan to give her came up for the rest of her life what a torture\nAnd they never told her she could come to Dr Lederman Thirteen eighty four Broadway at thirty eight street\nWhere we take most insurances and I saw her last night and we\nChecked her out and I spent lots of time with her and her husband and the answer our questions and our staff checked her insurance and we made churches all covered and then she called me this morning just she wanted to go through over the facts and she was she was afraid of telling her chemotherapy doctor says I Want him or came up\nShe hates came out she's been poisoned by chemo our hands have been poisoned or feed it been poisoned\nAnd hasn't worked she just had came over a few months ago and the cancer came right back and she's afraid of telling the chemo doctor she wants to stop the chemo\n... doctor that should be ashamed it's the chemo doctor who should be ashamed who gave her lots of cable just a few months ago and it didn't work and the cancer traveled and now the chemo doctors should be ashamed for telling your you have to have chemo for the rest of your life or hospice that's not true\nIt's not true at all\nAnd that's why we're here today so you can learn I'm not selling anything except for a Jew ... and so you could learn what happens if God Forbid it happens to you and this woman is a listener and she learned she understood\nThat just because the cable doctor was telling her she had to have ... beautiful lovely educated woman\nTelling you have to go on hospice to die\nOr came all the rest of your life it's like torture number one or torture number two when there's non invasive treatments like ours pinpoint invisible beams\nTo attack the cancer that's blocking the airways to open up the airway to make that cancer go away isn't that a lot more appealing and with us as a ... percent success rate for the rest of the life of the patient\nThis woman had cable to David worked for a couple of months added so toxic and the doctor was unfair with her as a doctor wasn't honest with her and the doctor didn't give her all the choices\nI went to medical school to be able to help people I didn't go to medical school to solve chemo or sell surgery or cut off people's arms or legs or breast her lungs what are they doing over there\nWhat are they doing to tell this woman she has to go a hospice or of chemo for the rest of her life let's be honest and that's why so many people are coming to Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nBecause they're not getting the straight information if the surgeons are telling people you have to cut off your arm or your leg or whatever\nAnd the cable people are telling you have to have came up for the rest of your life\nHey there's other options or other treatment options this is why I'm first in America with body radio surgery and I can tell you I was tortured by those doctors I was tortured by the chemo doctors\nTortured by the surgeons tortured by the radiation doctors still to this day because they're so jealous of our work they want to get chemo for the rest of the life

awards on the film festival circuit about seven seven and next week you know not to put ourselves in the back we're going to be in in the London\nUm ... international short film festival in London international short film here next Wednesday and Thursday I Believe in in London or you know I don't know it's for short films not short people\nIn the Monday Tuesday next Monday October eighth and ninth all you know what I was doing the time difference that's why I said as if there was some kind of a conservative or a couple of days ahead yeah what I thought that's what I thought so I thank you for correcting me read it [laughter] I always love at one of the hosts and star\nGets corrected by the guest [laughter] um [laughter] so you also won an Academy Award\nYeah I worked on the uh OJ Simpson documentary OJ made in America\nOh my God it was incredible\nSee all of a sudden with me is is impressed [laughter]\nYou know we had all these stars you didn't let her hand on my thighs\nI have no duty we had Tony ... Judi over we had\nMichael you're on a registered with her because you had something to do with the change in rhetoric now all of a sudden she goes you know part of something big thick\nBut Tony dances one like seven ... I say so I'm I'm not even gonna try\nTo do and boom boom boom over ... [laughter] I'm so jealous tell us about the OJ deal\nUh we got cold into a pitch meeting with the director and producer\nAnd I'm at a lot of interest in the case for you know Twenty years and I read a lot about it and uh it's just something I really wanted to do and\nUh my company at the time the string theory is owned by a good friend of mine um we did I think like maybe a hundred and eighty five pieces of animation and design a basically I was the executive producer of the visual effects in the animation for the entire five part series\nAnd do you do actually have a statute did they give you\nKnow they're actually really weird about statues in general I think the only get one or two and the rule is if you're going to even give it to someone in your family you have to offer to sell it back to the academy for one dollar and they can buy it or allow you to give it to somebody basically just to keep it all the bay begin I obviously looked a lot on ...\n[laughter] well you you know the the Emmys at least the the local Emmys in as a regional amaze you just put down how many if you when you want to I didn't even have to justify as long as you have the thirty five dollars for the with all their boots over bowling trophies the original things are really cheesy but you know to show it every\nDay time whether like all the really weird I mean whether he's on the front of the original MA is okay or one or two\nI'm much you know something macadam your ward Mr Big shot documents ... why don't we explore the double murder [laughter] um we\nAre the term homicide homicide okay I'm Sorry to if I was like what was alleged ... ... yeah the other guy as the homicide was real and be all mental is alleged who or what was it ... if I did it and it was like\nReally tiny you guys had like access to a lot of documents and stuff right I mean for the yeah I went to visit OJ in prison a couple of times know did you know no no we actually wasn't approach to do the documentary he did he did turn it down\nA lot of money for probably ... and so now\nWhat what was the weirdest thing that you or or the coolest thing that you discovered while you were doing was research for the documentary ...\nGetting our hands on like original documents from the court system um\nYou know we actually had to recreate these documents by hand try to match Han writings try to actually get I'm Nicole journals and then bring to life in the film so they can actually be lit a certain way and just so you can bring them into a certain atmosphere so getting your hands on his original documents when you already have a deep interest in something like that is pretty cool wow\nWow and I bought his Heisman Trophy so that was kind of all\nWhen did you know [laughter] I bought in Vegas my friend Rob the room that I with them you know you can't say these things on the radio because people things when you say something on the radio that automatically means it's true oh so people will leave the Internet's can measure radio [laughter] like the word of God over here\nAnd then miss Johnson and thinking of ... I was just wondering if you discover any new information\nSo I mean I I come from a really crazy detective background my whole family grandparents everyone was NYPD I'm so I yeah I'm I'm a big sleuth myself and um\nSo the leaf theory and this actually was not really approaching the documentary but I've read a lot about this is one of the lead theories from the sheriff's department Los Angeles county is that the reason why you have DNA partial matches or it says OJ's eldest son who was not Nicole's son\nUh that did the murders\nAnd um the he actually was wearing a picture of him wearing a skullcap which is very similar to the one that was found near the murder um he had a golden retriever matches the hair and fiber that was found also at the murder it's explains why there's a partial DNA matched not a full day in a match to OJ\nAnd one thing I didn't know before the documentary was around ... severely screwed up because he was like a crazy leaves like martial artists like fifty ... whatever it is their degree [noise]\nUm so they said you ever had partake in bronco they basically screwed some pretty bad during a fight like the the absolute mangled someone\nAnd an ex they've had OJ strip down naked into police barracks like in the morning and there was a scratch on and they're like there's no way this guy did this because Ron Goldman beat the hell out of someone that night so wow and\nThat's why not go sit in fact they exactly [laughter]\nYeah and his son has never been questioned by the police department to this day his son was was the way to Florida next day and OJ hired a lawyer for his son before you hire Johnny Cochrane from so\nWhy didn't learn and never had any number and none had three violent outburst all against women all involving a knife his son was on a much gets offended medication and been hospitalized several times um and you look at\nThe new look exactly the same so even if there was like somebody at night up might see a finger and I mean all\nAll those sailing both sides of the single question thing okay [laughter] well yeah you're very careful about that now now I'm going to get a conversation back to me [laughter]\nI was on the radio comedy I don't know it's fine just wanted was all of this will be edited out I was like an object [laughter] there's no there's a fascinating don't get me wrong [noise]\nWhat was the motive oh so this is all another weird things from the cold at night that I Know wrap it up we could add if I'm Nicole was supposed to eat\nThat night so OJ's eldest son actually was a waiter in a restaurant and she was supposed to eat at a restaurant knew that he was a waiter there with Ron Goldman and she killed and she went to a different restaurant he left that night without clocking out from Russia and the only time he never clocked out he just manually like he just disappeared\nThat a lot of crazies up so to me that's my theory well we don't mind but I mean the one I subscribe to it will\nYou know it's it's like from a couple of years ago I found one of the flavors is moxie so I think\nThey're all extend them and it's just an awful lot of like ... the the different colors that we're all send them to\nSee when I was a kid they were called red hopped red house with a with a sort of a jelly bits which is you put in like a ... a bottle of vodka or by law bourbon and they dissolve it's much better for you than the than the cinnamon stuff that they have\nWhat's it called like a ghetto gold saga you just to know\nI mean what does this stuff that you made out of antifreeze which is the the really spicy\nFire law fireball fireball the fireball or the fireball\nIs any free so if you don't want to get any breeze but you want that hot spicy bourbon experiences but a handful of red hot in the bourbon and\nDon't try this at home 'cause I'm just offering this as an exact cooking show they show that was one of my show I could if I Want to be a cooking show is going to be heard and show but it's not going to talk about in the exciting things like movies and film\nAnd film and movies which is actually the same thing except like document is\nIncidental this which is the award winning short film that brand and direct pitch and Andrew Smith and I wrote and\nA ... a million and myself starring uh this is before we had you Whitney otherwise you would add apart believe me um and and Brandon came up with this idea um to put like the word is like some of the dialogue as words up on the other ... in the actual frame of the thing and\nAt first I was like what is up and then I realized that it gives like a like a children's storybook field so it really it's it's really it's really really kind of cool and I think that's one of the reasons why we're winning so many wars on the word on the festival circuit\nLet's just kind of always writing so it's kind of felt you know something on the\n... you know what they call it that is correct precision that crash that's that's my motto precision inclined\nJust one day step back I said she's always writing ever writes them more it was really it was a big eye opening moment is er into a big creative directorial decision\nActually probably the best one was when I we actually had to go back to the original illustrator and get the new frames of you doing stand up\nThose weren't drawn remember the original right that's how I made the little what was it the cocoon I think the club that was the ... crew was the name of the club was really cute that wasn't on\nYou know it's really weird when we actually have something that's now available for public consumption you've done it like three years ago you forget everything about it at all of a sudden I Wonder we wrote that we we shot that we're we're in this is one of those weird things like how long it takes me to do the OJ a movie\nTwo years just about two years but still to this day Dr man just as the only thing that my mom actually liked [laughter] she was she said now that's funny\nOh say that they that's that's good for you\nAnd then just to show a kind of critics she is I center music video I directed last year and she says can I ask you questions so sure she said did you\nDo the commercial before the video was the video [laughter] I said why should the commercial is fantastic video I didn't care for it [laughter] luckily I didn't I didn't do the commercial does music videos that you my name's in it so yeah I didn't\nCare for that [laughter] and my mother didn't like anything I did that keeps us going on I ... that caused the search for approval and and uh when I run\nEverything by her she hates everything I've ever done it's it's documented that so I knew\nYou know I Wonder if like the really really rich guys the really successful guys like\nMark Zuckerberg from Facebook and I even a mosque and Richard Branson you know at least ... billionaires whether they have the same kind of\nMake up like they have that and their personality they're looking for the approval the looking for the except instead of looking for their parents don't really tell them that they're now they want the money they just want the money has nothing to do with that but [noise]\nAnd you don't want to know that it's all about the money 'cause 'cause he almost got a couple of weeks\nAgo really bad weeks and I'm Richard Branson just jump right on that he used the loan mosques misfortune as an opportunity to promote his own thing he exploited one person's face for his own financial gains\nHe um he's using it to launch his um

Kavanaugh\nBecause a lot of people I think are thinking well he's on now so wrong was made right with the confirmation of judge capital\nI'm not happy at all\nI Am absolutely disgusted by what the

Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nSee that should be a happy ending to a horror story but\nIt's not there's still bitter this there are still concerned for the country\nThe Democratic party will now just move seamlessly on the midterm elections with the fawning media into with little recognition that they turn their constitutionally required duty of why it vice and consent\nInto a political dead Baluch demolition derby\nInstead of bridging the dangerous widening divide in our country the Democrats use that divide to stir up

[noise]\n\nBecause the shame belong squarely on the Democratic party who could care less by the way about Brett Kavanaugh and his family or Christine Blasey Ford or the so called survivors and we'll talk about the name of the second but the survivors\nThey were playing to the resistance and they didn't care if they ruin the lives and reputations\nOf two people unnecessarily that didn't matter to them what was left in the ashes didn't matter\nIt was just scorching the year they did this for themselves\nUsing accusations that were accompanied by no evidence or corroboration that date back to high school\n\nAccusations that wouldn't be taken seriously by a court by local law enforcement or a corporation but somehow were taken seriously by democratic members of the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nIt was quite obvious that it was evil it was obvious what they were doing from the very beginning\nAfter they tried\nThey they try tactic after tactic after tactic after tactic and as one failed the next ... the next tactic got worse\n\nBut the Democrats were willing to just strip away the ones to pack up all reputation of a good man in front of his family his parents and his two little girls and in doing so they hurt the reputation of the Senate\nThink about it Christine blocks\nFord shared her deepest darkest secrets in a letter to Dianne Feinstein asking the senator for confidence\n\nAsking the senator please keep her letter in confidence and and and do share it her name with anyone trusting her and then that letter was sent to the Washington Post and that's where\nThat's why there had to be a full investigation into what happened because no one will ever now send important information to the Senate and confidence that is going to be at that from\nNow on no one\nWill share information with the Senate because they can't be trusted\nWith information\nAnd they also hurt the me too movement\nThe foundation of that movement movement is that women must be believed\nAnd now there is this new awakening that the allegations are gonna have to be proved because of this joke\nThey hurt public access to government as there is a call the cut off\nThe hallways and elevators and the Senate office buildings after paid political activist harassed stalked Republican politicians inner orchestrated protest\nThe fear now is that that anger could easily turn to violence\nThey crushed any chance of bipartisanship because the hatred over this nominations go to linger\nAnd they hurt the country a country that was already divided\nThey stoked anger that divides us even more than the entire time they were doing this they were sending out fundraising emails God I Hope the Democratic party pays for this and November\nI Hope there is a backlash I Hope the American people are smart enough to see through this not the people that are already biased I get that I get that there's people that are blinded by by us and they can't\nSee the forest for the trees they they don't know what deterioration there was to our constitution and our country by what was happening I get it\nI guess if there were some of those people or people that don't care they just don't care they want to save abortion so much that they don't care\nThat a man has falsely accused\nThat it wants to pack up all reputation reputation is just stripped away they don't care\n\nThat's the same person that leak this the the the letter from Christine Blasey Ford the same person that that that's what drove that person\nTo do that that same blinded by us\nAt the end justifies the means well guess what you didn't get the ending you want it and now what now you burn up the entire process\n\nAnd if the Democrats somehow win in November with this this gusting to play display\n\nGod help us all one eight hundred aid for aid WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two to I've never seen anything like\nThis I've never seen somebody use\nLook I don't even believe all the allegations so I I don't know if they're real victims of sexual\nAssault or get into that a little bit later to why I don't believe these allegations any of them and they may have all been concocted then they might have all been part of a political agenda and think about that\nThing about being so blinded by your own lust for power\nYour own lust for personal profit your own last for personal fame that you're willing to weaponize and this helped destroyed an important movement in this country\nYou're willing to ruin the Senate nomination process and the reputation of the of the Senate you're willing to ruin people's lives\nFor yourself\nAnd to use the most disgusting allegations without any sense of morality any sense of decency\nI was thinking that today because his latest statement today was if you don't like what happened to get out there and vote it's unfortunate that half the country doesn't see how the Democrats to destroy all the time they're willing to let the country burned just to keep their own personal our\nRight and and tear down some of our most solemn procedures in institutions\nAnd some some of the some of the things we hold dear some of the things we hold dear like rules

next week\nHe had a good point though about the fact that the Republican Party stayed together and showed strike but they I Will I promise you the hero of this\nI I Know people look at Lindsey Graham it was a big moment I Know John corner and I know Mitch McConnell put a big part of it I Know Susan Collins came in the end and\nAnd and tied the ribbon and and gave the American people are present she was ... when she was wonderful one of the best speeches I've ever heard in the center for\nReally was and I know I didn't agree with everything you said as Judy said a moment ago I there are some of those things I didn't agree with\nBut I Know who she is and I know what she can\nDo\nAnd she came through and crystallize for every one of the problems with this and she has more credibility because of what she's done in the past so who is an important important moment\nBut none of this would happen without the leadership of Donald Trump it was Donald Trump the student from and said to the Republican base\nThat supports him wholeheartedly almost colds\nUsually he said to them this is important we have to have this I'm not backing away I watch judge Kavanaugh\nOh you're selling me on this kind of sounds nice anyway uh wouldn't want to talk about [laughter] they want to know the reason I called sure okay the coolest you need to shower I mean it sounds like okay go ahead [laughter]\nThe reason I called the is I I'm thrilled that Kevin ... was a confirmed can whatever that he's going to be on the Supreme Court and the thing that I hadn't been so embarrassed about are all these when these women and my gender these women attacking members of the Senate and Congress\nAnd and screaming and yelling and all these even famous women who make all kinds of crazy threats in at the at the rallies\nI embarrassingly part of that gender and I I I think that's the need to move and started on Facebook and everybody jumping on the bandwagon and I'm not and I think I Need to start another movement called the not mean movement\n[laughter] you're like I Do like that I had not me\nNot me okay so this is what I like to lecture I left on some notes other capital too much like rainy can stop me\nNeed to have federal offered being a victim and becoming empowered by destroying other namely men many need to where it had not been victimized\nBut simply hate Matt and even if really victimize it's not okay to destroy other to make a point not to mention those who simply lie about it to get attention and or belong\nMe a woman doesn't mean we are automatically a victim are telling the truth that's what gets me because I'm just I mean Dr\nFord was a woman and we assume she's telling the truth\nIs right she's a woman made no sense to me\nYeah great point it's not just her it is a lot of people to come for the accusations of sexual harassment not look\nBloody Ford had somebody at a high school part of us too much to drink if you believe her story get on top of her\nNot not\nRape her didn't even ... even take her clothes off and get past or close to get on top got on top of her when she tried to scream ... the I think the worst part of the story is then he put his hand over amount if you believe her story\nAnd then she left nothing else about her story though however makes any sense I've not\nBeen corroborated know knows why should I Believe her not only does nothing cooperated\nNothing makes any sense for instance she claims that they play loves music so nobody could here then she says in the next sentence she heard she heard people talking downstairs out how did you hear people talking downstairs if the music playing that loud yeah and by the way they how do you get out how did you get out with their two staircases\n... she said she got out and she went outside and and who was waiting for you there's no cell phones back there she didn't have a ride home how did you get home there's so much about her story that makes no sense she would be even\nRemember taking her home right ... what but what if she was driven there and nobody from the party she she said nobody from the party drove around if she was taking home then how did the person knows that she was coming downstairs for a ride like there's no cell phones anymore\nMm I mean back then so what who\nWho came to get her ... she did she did she go across the street and make a phone call or how did she not remember that\nWell if the facts and the evidence or not they're making the accusation simply not enough in order that order medically mean it's the truth that's where I where I get lost in all that\nWay but that's the good thing about this if you own the there's there's four or five good things about this and one of the good things about this is we all woke up to the me too movement\nThat in the past and she she was receiving a little bit of this and it's now starting to turn in the past any time a woman made an accusation we had to believe her that\nWay it was that's ... ... it was it\nWas a road do insanity buddy stopped with her it's stopped with her people said no this is going to for added stopped and he was confirmed anyway\nSo I don't I just hear all those women screaming and yelling and they were on the news and we're the women are like me were quiet where well hey we don't yell and scream and confront people and try to terrorize and get them to do what we want\nAnd and I and I think we lost in the shuffle because I won't lie or exaggerate in order to gain power hurting to destroy others it's not the way to get justice this is not the way to get justice\nNo and I got to go marry go figure shelling that\nYeah I uh [noise]\nI think there were people there in support of Kavanaugh they just weren't screaming they weren't claiming to be survivors and I have so many problems with the word survivor\nBut I'm not sure if you're with me on this but let me go through a couple of things that I have a problem with\nSurvivor assumes the story you're telling his true if you were a survivor and you're accusing something somebody of something\nThen that means your stories true because we're calling you a survivor it actually happened and the other person is guilty that's what it means to be a survivor a beat it didn't start until this whole cabinet thing they weren't called survivors\nThey were victims of child abuse or they were victims but usually was an alleged victim that all of a sudden we took away that because you ...\nYou know she's my senator from New York unfortunately you know and I want to know where is she going after Keith Ellison and Cory Booker\nFor their past transgression where is she doing that I don't stand\nFor especially Ellison I mean I'm Cory Booker eroded asked said back when he was in college so I\nKnow but Larry this is what I'm trying to get out with Kirsten Gillibrand she is claiming basically zero tolerance so I may be wrong but I'm starting to understand a disturbing trend that comes from\nThe speech to a movement is that\nShe went after a she got rid of Al Franken from Minnesota as soon as the one that led the charge against him right he's a he's a white man even though he's liberal he's a white man Keith Ellison and Cory Booker\nOr not I'm just saying that's what they don't want to eat the wrong so it's kind of a selective me too movement is what I'm understanding from people like Kirsten Gillibrand so I just wanted to throw that out there\nAh that's point number one point number two is you know\nIf you're are you a football fan liar yet on and make a sports analogy up yeah go ahead I don't blitz Tom Brady just don't do it it's not a good idea he's got a burn you all the time to look at an allergy I Know where you're going\nHe loves when you do that okay now the Democrats don't learn they have a terrible defensive coordinator wherever you as they they figure let's do this thing where we attacked a you know attack\nA cabin or and what they did is Dave blitz basically the Republican base they ... you know Republicans now may even have a chance of winning the house now based on the splits\nNow if for some unknown reason the Democrats do when the how\nThey are I Will guarantee that than a blitz Brady again they're going to go to try to impeach Donald Trump and Donald Trump is gonna love that he's going to walk to admit because that will guarantee is going to winning twenty twenty because them trying to impeach him which I Believe they will try to do\nAnd it won't work because the Senate will never vote you need two thirds of boats so it's a stupid move there are going to do it I'm predicting that they're going to do it they're going to the whole country is going to go through this mess which they're going through now when they try to pick from and he's gonna walks in twenty twenty he's going to win so easily it'll make it had been\nChris I agree with you I I Love the analogy by the way you don't blitz Tom Brady it's like you don't you don't go after Donald Trump like this I think is what you were getting out I also agree with you that if the Democrats take the house they're not saying it now because they believe it will hurt them in the midterms coming up but they will\nTry to impeach Donald Trump I I don't think\nThey'll be crazy and do it for nothing but they're going to try they're going to wait for the first opportunity and then they're going to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump\nAnd I also agree with you Chris and it's the best thing that could happen to Donald Trump 'cause they're not going to be able to get them as you pointed out I don't even know if they're going to get the votes in the house to do it but they're not going to get him they're going to end up looking stupid he's then going to have every hero needs an arch villain\nAnd right now Donald Trump doesn't have one\nHe goes after the media you kind of goes after the Democrats but when you have somebody that has some strengthening can come back after you it's going to make him more powerful\n\nSo I I I agree with you I agree with that scenario that the impeachment proceedings will start and it will benefit Donald Trump were coming back after this [noise]\nScream of perfect time on white matter releases chauvinist\nGo out there and change the course of human event whatever Seventy seven do you have these\nSays
