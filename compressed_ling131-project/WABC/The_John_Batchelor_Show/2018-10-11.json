bachelor show so [noise]\nI'm John bats are with Gordon Chang and we're discussing trouble in China and trouble in the United states about China we've heard the predicates hear of a campus university of Rochester a very successful higher education representing all the\nColleges and campus universities in the United states anxious about an event about Tibet for heaven's sakes\n... bat kept back Gordon it's ... ... ... it's the best bet that\nThe Dalai Lama hosted at the White House every president as far back as I could remember it's Tibet so are we are joined by a young graduates to a post graduate student at the University of Rochester Rochester\nA essay who came and he tells the beginning of the story mark Clifford of the south China Morning post former editor is also here and he'll ask questions tells the beginning of the story that he's disrupted in his plans to hold an event about Tibet\nAnd he gets information that it's not going to be invited on ... it's not it's not pleasant for the University of Rochester to have it on campus because snowflakes yeah so ...\nSo say who you're going to have this event in a mate auditorium in on the University of Rochester\nCampus march thirty first of this year just hours before it's supposed to occur you get ... off into a remote classroom you know will be on a place where anyone's gonna go\nAnd you of course afterwards want to go and find out what happened you'd go talk to the dean of students what do you hear from the D\nSo what I heard from the dean on my personal conversation with him was that a um he actually had to re book the room um after it getting canceled because he didn't want the university to look like it was censoring itself\nUm and I don't know if she meant this on a on a on a goodwill or whatever it may be but um he said next time that I I have an idea about holding this event\nI should go and and and talk to the Chinese community first and the university before I hold this before I hold this type of event so that um this type of incident wouldn't occur again\nI'm at and at that point I all I knew that the student group pulled off and and that was the main issue however the weird thing is that up until that time I'm even ... which I actually talked to the dean five days after my event occurred on campus thankfully\nAnd up until that time I haven't got I had gotten a single email from the student organization that actually pulled out from the event\nAnd so he actually then suggested that I go talk to the student organization about what had happened but uh all he knows is that it was the student organization that pulled up and that was the main reason\nAnd and the upshot of all of this is basically the University of saying that the Chinese students get a veto on what can be hosted on campus which really is it's essentially was said you know they try to prevent people from going to your event how many people eventually showed up in that\nRemote area oh I'm unlike unlike what a lot of people believe we have over Seventy people show up most of them were ah we had a diverse range of students but the most of them were students are that either came from mainland China\nOr those students who are a Chinese Americans but other than that we had a other a diverse members of the university community\nSo despite the best efforts of perhaps the Chinese government but certainly the administrators at the University of Rochester you get an inclusive event talking about Tibet a sensitive subject with Chinese mainland students Chinese Americans in a good cross section of the University of Rochester so it was\nAll for not all of this attempt to ... your um event off campus right detail garden where cooking a lot of diverse characters who are also the Centers for the future those are young people they have long memories will\nThey do John and this indicates that a lot of the efforts of um the Chinese government um and the Chinese security services um to censor in a press or a counter productive it just doesn't\n... to mark because you mentioned the umbrella movement the a yellow umbrella protests in Hong Kong those were young people\nWere young people and just to wrap up or what Gordon said I mean think about this is quite chilling ... the the uh or would you said John that the Chinese government in Chinese people in in Hong Kong Chinese putative Chinese students associations have a veto over what can be discussed on campus\nAnd I when I find shocking\nThe administrators go along with this so much of the time that people are so scared about a little bit of money that's being doled out through Confucius institutes or or did they just allow themselves to get intimidated look over their shoulders and it's not usually some high level pressured some\nMid level person who just are two sides are going to pull the plug on some inconvenient event\nTo these Chinese students there at the University of Rochester they're paying full ticket they don't have scholarships here or there on money from home money from mom and dad what are you know about their resources well\nFrom what I Know a lot of them actually do pay out of pocket a film them are on our our on some form of scholarships some from what I've heard is a government scholarship\nBut from ah from what I Know recently is that some of them even um I get sponsored by somebody to come here and study right so um they're paying full they're paying full top dollar um\nAnd that's good for the university but in the university where you see what the motive here they don't want to disrupt their a flow of ... are are more mainland China of course there's a Chinese is a student association\nYou know ... there's a the Chinese students and scholars association is on most or virtually all campuses where there are mainland Chinese students\nAnd really this is simply an organization although it's supposedly Chinese students and scholars is really run out of Beijing and its intended to monitor um students also to organize them for political activities on American soil this is a violation of American sovereignty clear and simple\nBy ... the foreign minister of China chastised over the Decatur we mentioned over Taiwan the threats to Taiwan over tariffs\nAnd over in ... and ... overall that the Trump Administration is being in transition worn in public about this book back because he's got the Trump style you know let anything go\nBut I Am struck by how the Chinese with their confidence in the long game our our act I would say they were acting rattled if there were a couple of cowboys wandered into my ...\nWell I think that there are increasingly assertive would be the nice word aggressive belligerent or less nice words um\nAnd it's not clear whether it's a coming from some kind of bravado or some real sense of confidence or if they're actually speaking to impress their boss in one he's got one Boston as a matter of fact that boss guy named ... being\nA ... probably should have been meeting pond pay oh in on a previous visit he did meet ... first\nHe sends him to subordinate to subordinate give him a tongue lashing and you know as as we were discussing before we went on air Jon usually in diplomacy you're behind closed doors right you don't do that kind of thing is you try to make a point to to someone your boss as well as the guy on the other side of the ocean\nYou know the other thing here is that what the Chinese are doing when you look at the actual actions you know canceling dialogues and and the rest of it\nOh yeah see dialogue castle in the middle of October very significant\nThere's this ... security dialogue canceled October there are a lot of milk Tamil exchanges that have already been cancelled a clearly they're not going to put on anymore or at least in the near future\nUm trade talks have been canceled all of these things that have not occurred have generally been for the benefit of China throughout the years and for Beijing not to go forward with them as an indication that yeah they're throwing a tantrum but they're doing so in a way which is counterproductive to their own interests\nSo that shows that there's got to be some sort of stress and the political system right now because they're doing things that don't advance their causes and when countries do things like that you know something is fundamentally wrong at the top\nAnd mark life in Hong Kong it's I'm I've not been there but Gordon tells me that it's a magical place that is part space colony part of part of the Asia economy\nIs they're anxious to talk about this is their whistling past the graveyard talk how did they regard these in these notes that are discordant well\nFirst of all I think it's remarkable how much space Hong Kong people preserved for themselves in the Twenty one years since um the People's Republic of China took what was a British colony back into Chinese hands in Chinese sovereignty\nA lot of people thought that this was going to happen much faster so we've had a half a million I'd say probably a million people out in the streets in two thousand three protesting against proposed national security legislation\nFour years ago we had the umbrella movement where the center of the city was occupied for Seventy nine days\nSo and the one hand that's that's remarkable to Hong Kong people are like water they're usually very gentle a few drops here and there and every once in a while to get together and there's a cascade of torrent that sweeps away um be what's in the way however\nThe last few years have been really tough and there is as I said before very concerted campaign to narrow what is permissible what can be talked about in Hong Kong um\nThe the leading pro democracy newspaper website apple daily is a has been way you know it's been the subject of a boycott and its print operations and on its website so which is seen more and more uh actions of this sort and I I think it's got people feeling pretty discouraged pretty beaten down into 'em\nUp for the most ... you know people who care are nervous and then on the other hand much of the business community of course much of the government much of the elite is saying don't worry everything's going to be fine\nBut it doesn't look like things are going to be fun because you do have\nYou know you simply you got to have a large portion of the population that's not buying into this if you go back to July first or June thirty I'm Nineteen Ninety seven I'm the last day of British Rule there was this euphoria that China was going to take over\nAnd if you would pull people then which I'm sure somebody did\nYou you have like Ninety nine percent of the people saying this was really going to be very good\nBut doubt if you were to take that same poll you have people say look I don't even believe I'm a Chinese I I'd they they're saying for instance I Want to be independent these are voices we hadn't heard of six years ago so it seems to me that Beijing is doing\nIs I'm actually making Hong Kong much more hostile territory for its interests it absolutely has made it more hostile to actually and the thing that's important here today is ten ten double ten day it is the national day for Taiwan the republic of China\nA lot of people in uh Nineteen Ninety seven were saying look Taiwan you too can become part of the People's Republic this was going to be okay because you're going to have autonomy in Hong Kong we're going to be the shining example that leads you people Taiwan\nBack to the Chinese and it's not working out that way Hong Kong is now the negative example for Taiwan it is the example for people in Taiwan and say look we don't want any part of this look what these Chinese did to Hong Kong\nMark I tell a story there people waiting to board the aircraft Ted Kennedy and nowhere\nTo go to Asia right now so they're listening to us All right I tell the story an anecdote no names of the young men who does business in China and I asked him about the security concerns we see them at reported in the newspapers all the time\nA Chinese cyber theft\nOr also minders when you\nDr in China and the mainland China not hookup mainland China and uh the secure the iPhone is not secure anywhere really unless you turn it off and maybe not even then they told me that when he does business in China which has not infrequently he leaves all of his electronics in America\nAnd when he arrived from the mainland he's aware that there are a minder they're no where he is he has face to face meetings\nAnd they exchanged thoughts and then he leaves the country now he has a particular technology I won't name it but it's highly highly sought after around the world\nThat is a story that I Would expect to find in a thriller as I get on the airplane as I'm sure people are reading thrillers before they fall asleep\nBut I tell this story to those lines of Newark and at at JFK because I think something has changed I don't think that was true ten years ago when Gordon and I started talking there's a level of surveillance that now suggest violence is close\nLulu certainly a level of surveillance that would um I'm pretty much any foreign business person going to China to leave their electronics and hope you're absolutely right and most of anybody who knows what they're doing doesn't bring their phones to John\nAnd without our electronics without being able to travel to China as a a capitalist you have already exceeded to the power of the anaconda you've already surrendered some of your freedom well\nOr looked at another way China's surveillance state is at war with its attempt its own attempts to develop a more modern economy China's largely I'm buying borrowing begging stealing technology and a lot of hard work pretty much caught up in his pretty close to the technology frontier but how are they going to get farther\nIf their own people can't talk can't trust each other can't do we chat which is like what's that um\nAnd our um you know under a state of surveillance and can't think and talk freely I mean this is really China's dilemma\nYeah and this is going to be important because obviously control of technology artificial intelligence quantum commuting\nComputing quantum communications fired gee wireless biotechnology biotechnology all of these are really going to determine the course of the twenty first century\nChina who stole a lot of it in some places it's actually a head um but it's only been ahead because they've been able to get foreigners to come and take foreign technology\nUm being able to develop on his on his own that remains to be seen way thank mark Clifford from the from Hong Kong\nHe's the former editor of the south China Morning post which is the daily reading Hong

red notices to arrest or people that that the Chinese Communist party felt where a had committed crimes in China who were present the abroad\nAnd one of them was dark on the east or the president of the German based world way gr Congress so the the way gr government in exile\nAnd he was a you know China brought up some various charges against him he was not deported back to China and eventually the red notice was withdrawn I think that that make the Chinese very unhappy that Mr among was not able to deliver this um wicker independent this leader to them\nBut in in general I mean one expects that when I'm someone that's appointed to an international organization nominated by their own country that they will serve the interests of the international organization and not be primarily responsive to the interests of the country that sent them to the international organization\nSo this really calls into question all at the Chinese Communist party members who are working in foreign organizations as to whether they can in fact be loyal that organization or simply agents for the interests of the Chinese regime\nYou know Charles the strikes me as another ... um incidence of overreaching and see jumping\nThat he demands absolute loyalty he gets the Sims he gets signs of it in China and now he thinks he can get absolute loyalty from foreign organizations as well and it just seems to me that there is something that's going on in Beijing I don't know what it is\nYou know it could be over the ... could be over ... the businessman turn tell all ... who knows but the point is that China has done something to black and its own reputation\nOr this is something that's going to take a very long time for the Communist Party to recover from if it ever recovers from it and essentially we're looking at um probably intense political struggle at the top of Beijing because something like this wouldn't happen but for problems at the top of the political system\nYes I think it's indicative of issues are in within China because of the failure of of the sheep policies\nUm both in leading to the United states finally I'm responding in a serious way to China's flaunting of international conventions and I'm afraid\nA conventions and purr learning of us technology and also you know the belt and road program is not going well China's over extending its its

with countries like Cuba and Zimbabwe and and Cambodia\nAnd pouring money into into Pakistan Turkmenistan in Venezuela um you know that's that stresses the Chinese economy a great deal and the expectation of economic return as the ball\nAnd even the expectation of political loyalty from these rogue regimes is also low so the policies are just not working the way that that she had promised\nAnd I think that this is causing this\nThe pet in the regime and there's no effective means because the sheets concentration of power for there to be a natural process a transfer of power

being challenged it has problems all over the place\nSee jumping is being blamed for these problems and now he's reaching out and trying to hold others accountable so they're going to be a number of scapegoats here there's going to be intense political fighting especially because ...

headlines from the Financial Times newspaper out of London it's also published here in in Asia I thought I'd read them off and no particular order\nA aimed at the troubles in the People's Republic first of all we have Chinese age and charged over attempt to steal GE secrets allegations relate to move to obtain information from us aerospace companies\nWe have the secretary the treasury Mr mention\nWarning China a currency devaluation U.S Treasury secretary says an interview that he wants to issue raised in trade talks\nAnd we have also the U.S to withstand scrutiny of foreign investments focusing on China new measures aimed to protect critical technology from countries including China so that's London talking as opposed to I could go to the wash the wall Street Journal and find much more\nThis is a change of posture towards China in the United states and I could say that in Britain I Want to extend this to the ... does China have a response to this are they just turning their backs and waiting for it to pass good morning to\nGet even in college I Am actually I don't think China does have a a a response China has got used to ... way of dealing and many of those headlines of course just reflect what China's to some extent mean getting away with for a long time are we are by their spine that industrial espionage\nWe know by currency manipulation and self control of markets on free markets untrustworthy markets [noise] um\nAnd we know that there's a ... of an investment it's just not there so these are all issues that were for the three of us we in the west being starting with China neither is being a change of ah you know focus and Washington\nAnd elsewhere and even in the ... even the Germans are and I realized that hey China is not our friend it's not our partner\nOr we have to be much more circumspect and I don't think China has a response primarily because think about what's happening here you're basically asking to China to basically do have a different model from the past twenty or Thirty years and it just doesn't rape it ready for that that doesn't know how to respond are praying challenged\nYeah I think you're right freezer because what we're seeing is you know confusion on the part of Beijing you know for decades they've been able to get their way they've been able to you know smile and if that doesn't work they've been bullying they've been intimidating they've almost always gotten what they want\nNow they've run into somebody called Donald John Trump and it's not working for them and I don't think that they know how to deal not only with Trump but also as you say\nWith the English with the Germans with everybody else this is a real moment of time where the world to bits and adopts a new policy in Beijing has yet to figure out how to deal with this\nI think that's right because it isn't as simple well Trump has made a big play for the deficit and that's all we have things that started the deficit is too big that's one major and I would argue pretty per measure of the overall relationship between China but even if China just starts buying more stuff from the states where there's more oil or you know energy or if it's the grains or whatever\nI fundamentally doesn't solve the problem off and on level playing field when it comes to China at family doesn't solve the problems is the political problems in China\nYou know and and China clearly it's if it's not panic it's clearly a flailing I write and you look at this Interpol chief that the Chinese ... that only two years ago I Am at Yankee here he is being disappeared in China and he's under investigation for corruption so much for the anti corruption campaign ... position Interpol two years ago in the first place\nIf wherever you look at China that that in math\nYeah and and when this this whole thing about currency manipulation I think is endlessly fascinating\nFor decades China yes did manipulated currency in other words they drove the value of the ... down in order to gain a treaty advantage for their exporters\nThis year of course the renminbi is falling precipitously against the dollar and other currencies but it's not because of Chinese currency manipulation as we define that term it's because the Chinese themselves don't want to hold their own currency\nSo they've been actually supporting the ... and that's the opposite of currency manipulation\nAnd that just shows the fragility of the Chinese system and I think we're going to see other symptoms of that for Jodi in the economy in Beijing has got to deal with that in a hostile environment because countries like the U.S are not trying to support China anymore\nFraser I went to press you we spoke with mark Clifford our colleagues about Hong Kong and how it's regarding these\nTroubled moments how is Singapore dealing with this disorder in on the mainland China because Singapore is a prosperous community and not not a small amount of it depends upon the success of China\nAre not just China but just global trade you know I'd say I looked at my window and see the harbor from the office here you know five years of the ships go through Singapore sports on on on a weekly basis in the hundreds of thousands of the containers um\nAnd so the global trade is very important to them that are really concerned about trade wars that always concerned about China and climbed on there to depend on Chinese to that as well but they're all from the sidelines they're clearly nowhere near the thick of it in the way the Hong Kong as\nBut a lot of people in an age are white because they simply don't know how are you the shake hiked\nAnd of course there are there and what he does well is because many of the complaints against China they know to be true this is ultimately you know it's ...\nCalling China's often anything it's calling the ... and saying look stop bullying the kids were not going to take it any longer things have got to change and so that it's changed coming and no uncertain how that comes is it going to\nBe an inclusive change where we can all still continue to grow but on a federal level or is it going to be at retrograde change where you know China becomes more inflated in global trade suffers I never want to become a somewhat isolationist we don't know yet\nYeah Fraser I don't know if you went to the ... conference in Singapore which I think just wrapped up but even Bremmer of Eurasia Group the risk consultancy said\nFrom the United states who recently took up that post and has been very successful these last month\nAnd the other is Dina Powell former member of the national Security Council now in private enterprise once again\nYou're a measure of these two candidates especially because\nThese are Republican conservative voices or not and the ... the president is as you as you said right after the election attitude no so how do you measure these two candidates for the attitude no Donald Trump good evening\nHi good evening to you John well both\nIndividuals are extremely accomplished a very smart people I'm\nDina Powell as I understand it um had served in the number to post at the national Security Council under general McMaster when he was a national security advisor very close to him you will recall that the president then dispatched with general McMaster and replaced him with John Bolton\nThe one of the big reasons why Trump replaced mc ... twofold actually one\nPersonally they didn't have much chemistry they just didn't get on but the other reason is at McMaster as accomplished as he was an is Mick master in many ways was deep state McMaster was established Schmidt this McMaster was off brand\nTo Donald Trump and well he shared a lot of the president's policy inclinations he worked against him in a lot of ways because he still cared what the establishment thought and thought to preserve establishment influence\nUh at the NFC and brought in a lot of foreign policy establishment types that were working often at cross purposes with the president and his immediate team\nOn major issues like ending the Iran nuclear deal getting out of the Paris climate accord or confronting China on their currency manipulation and the the trade deficit renegotiating NAFTA and so on [noise]\nYou know there were just too many problems in the mix master relationships that wouldn't mix master\nWas fired or let go a dean of how his deputy also chose to to leave because she didn't want to work after John Bolton that not all of that's understandable I think that\nUh the president's daughter Yvonne coach who's very influential probably suggested to the president that it would be wise after the Kavanaugh hearings to replace the woman with a woman\nAnd maybe that argument has had some traction with the president he might understand the politics in those terms\nBut I think Dina ... herself as accomplished as she is is off brand for the president\nAnd setting aside the gender issue here and looking at looking at the equation as\nWe really need to replace Nikki Haley was someone who will continue making the progress that she's made at the un I think ... the far far better choice Rick Grinnell is like an extension of President Trump he is fearless he is anti establishment\nA by the way he would be the first openly gay I'm a UN ambassador\nUm which would be sending a real signal to the rest of the world wouldn't it\nOut and Grinnell is he broke last diplomatic you spent many years that the United nations under five us un ambassadors a nominated by president of both parties\nBrock Obama George W. Bush and so on so he's got a wealth of experience he knows the institution better than anyone I've ever seen\nAnd he knows diplomacy [noise] part of the problem I think John is that in some ways for Grinnell is a victim of its own success\nHe has been a tremendous US ambassador in Germany he's essentially one of the few us ambassadors on the continent who actually know what they're doing and he has had tremendous success in leaning on German corporations major ones like Siemens and Dinah Miller\nStop doing business with Iran\nIn the face of new sanctions on the Iranian regime and the withdrawal of the U.S from the Iranian nuclear deal\nHe has to hit the ground running he doesn't waste any time he picks up the phone and talk to the CEOs that these companies himself he does all of the\nThe hard work and I think the president like having him there I mean the word is that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a little free to frack which is good and I think the president that we think the president might be a little loads to remove him from the center of Europe and bring him to New York at the un\nBut my feeling is that he should because I think given all the success he's had in Europe he could have even more sitting in Turtle Bay confronting all of our enemies and dealing with our our uh allies on a more regular basis\nPost common armonica we have to we must anticipate that this is the conversion consent post and that the Senate will weigh in and that very loud voices\nUm voices we heard during the cabin on happiness will speak again there are several senators running for president others raising money in these last days now this process wouldn't happen until after the election but in any event that's an opportunity again to raise your profile for the Democratic primaries\nThat begin pretty much the competition begins right away and twenty Nineteen\nAnd the beaches in Iowa so I Know that MSNBC and the rebels double\nCorrespondent for uh MSNBC Andrea Mitchell has already declared Grinnell very controversial talk for unacceptable because the explanation he offended and angle America all bats that translation he's not\nA one of us okay far no that's the recommendation but it's also warning Monica didn't Mr where no went through a rough process to get to Germany didn't it was a long wait and now a\nLong way thanks to the Democrats Chuck Schumer\nAnd now they're rearm so does I mean it does Grinnell want to face that pummeling again after ...\nAbsolutely he would uh work as a as a friend of mine and he is absolutely fearless and the recommendation that he makes on glue Merkel nervous is a good thing and the presidents seizing loves wreck because he's a fighter [noise] um I also think you know the assumption that Tina Peng which set sail through\nIt's also a big assumption I mean we don't know what they're after the Kavanaugh education I think anybody that the president puts up for a major nomination it's going to have to go through the ringer\nSo the question is who is willing to take this on who is willing to fight back I mean I think either one of them would be up for the fight but I think if you were looking for major major appointments\nIn the cabinet at the un who are extensions of their president and his populist revolution then I think the choice it's obvious that it's Rick right now\nJohn Bolton a longtime colleague in bars and I miss him I miss you John Bolton budget and the national security advisor and you're not admit that you're not permitted to talk freely John Bolton is said to favor Richard Grinnell rich Rick Cornell is that that is sensible the Monica that the national security advisor wants to have a\nA a voice in choosing the ambassador to the United nations\nYes of course in recall that John Bolton served as US ambassador to the un he knows the institution very well\nAfter being humbled by the Democratic Senate led by Joe Biden yes I Do recall\nThat yes and remember that President Bush had to a point there during recess made a recess appointment because it was so controversial and the Democrats may dislike the hell I remembered that what it was only there for a limited period I think it was a year\nMaybe because it was a recess appointment and he'll Bolton made tremendous progress there but he couldn't he didn't have enough time to actually start to reform the institution which I Know is really heavy lifting it's turning around a battleship in the middle east the ocean\nBut Nikki Haley made tremendous progress in that direction\nAlthough with regard to Iran North Korea\nYou want somebody to succeed her who will continue the boat and Haley legacy of confronting our enemies I dealing with our allies and trying to reform the corruption at the un

because the corporate belt is so far from the sun or the temperatures are very low almost absolute zero so this combination of great distance from the sun in cold temperature make it a perfect preservation zone for\nThese objects that are out there they are we believe a centrally earning changed over all these billions of years\nAnd so our ability to fly New Horizons across the quick rebel and observe ultimate truly up close and other corporate belt objects in the distance is somewhat similar to making an archeological dig into the history of our solar system and how the planets were for\nIt it's very high priority scientifically the national Academy of sciences right that is the highest priority or at the time that the New Horizons was getting started\nAnd now we're at the the second stage of combination of achieving that National Academy goal we've explored the Pluto system as you said in twenty Fifteen and now at New Year's eve and New Year's day courting twenty Nineteen we will make the first ever close up flyby\nOf of corporate belt object and we're going to revolutionize our knowledge what we know about it\nWhat about the dangers yes the risk out there is it crowded\nIt is not crowded or the corporate both is fast in fact that the surface area of the corporate belt is larger by a factor of several than all this space from the sun out to the planet next year\nAnd so even though the clippers just teeming with small bodies with small planets they are individually separated like great distances and so there is no significant risk to the spacecraft in crossing the Quaker belt which will be doing\nAll the way out in the end of the twenty twenties as a matter of fact because the corporate logos\nTwice as far out as we are now almost\nBut there there may be dangers at the fly by because if ultimately has large numbers of moons or rings or other structures we don't want to fly through those because our skied is so great we're traveling thirty two thousand miles per hour\nThat almost ten miles per second and striking anything even the size of a rice pellet could tread the spacecraft\nSo as we approach ultima\nWe're using the on board cameras in radio and pictures back to look for moons rains other hazards if we find them in our path will fire the engines and divert to a safer close approach distance or in order to make sure that everything goes well\nDavid\nUm you're you're flying by at this huge speed how long do you stay getting pictures of ultimate too late or if it's so quick that you you you don't spend much time getting pictures or how has that determined\nWell that's a great question you probably remember as we were on a ... approach to Pluto that we started getting pictures that were better than what the Hubble Space telescope to deliver a couple of months out and that's because politicized continent like\nThe size of the United states uh but ultimately is very much smaller it's about the size of Chesapeake Bay and in in the eastern seaboard\nAnd so although or cameras concurrently see it it's just a thought in the distance we're still Seventy million miles away we're closing it almost a million miles a day but\nWe'll only resolve it and be able to get high resolution pictures and images and other data types\nOnly in the last day before the fly by in the day of the fly by\nAnd we only get one shot at that if it doesn't go well on those two days or will come up with half a low for no loaf at all so we're planning very carefully and testing all the fly by plans to make sure that this very high speed flyby of this small\nScientifically valuable target at the food cure of our solar system is successful\nWe're we're we're looking towards ultimate truly but we have some hints about what you're heading towards and over the last year I Believe this summer and the summer before teams went to a remote places on earth Argentina South Africa ... uh Africa\nOr to view\nOf the object using a\nMethod called transit the transit system how did they do this Alan and what did they learn about alter my tool using the transit says\nWell this is a type of transit it's called a stellar occupation in which we predict mathematically we're on the earth ultimate will make a stars week out as it passes in front of and then we position telescopes in the expected shadow path\nOf ultimate and from signing how long this store weeks out we can determine the size of ... and by doing that at a whole series of places in the shadow we can map out its silhouette it shape and that's important because ultimately\nIs so small and so far away that even the Hubble Space telescope can't resolve it it's just to point to like this is the only technique that allows us to determine the size and shape\nA and we were successful at that uh one of our teams on your horizons are are going to be the strongest team led by Dr Mark ... deployed over fifty astronomers with two dozen telescopes to Argentina in the summer of forty seven and then again to Senegal\nIn Northern Africa this summer\nAnd in both cases they were able to get in the shadow cast watching wink out uh with uh\nOne of the more telescopes and as a result\nWe all are pretty good deed on the size of the things I said it's about the size of the Chesapeake Bay ab ... miles across\nWe have a pretty good indication of its

Greece and turkey right and the southern part the southern gas locked in a court order is now under construction starts in the Caspian Sea at Azerbaijan passes through the ... through Georgia\nAnd then crossed his through turkey or and\nThrough turkey it must chip Bulgaria that's why I'm Talking to the ambassador these that's the inter connector part but after Bulgaria the possibilities are mud many first of all the possibilities to go through Greece across the ... under the Iranians see\nTo Italy and southern Europe but you're also saying that these guys can connect to the Balkans and flow into Eastern Europe as well as I understand that so it can go in many directions from Bulgaria\nYeah absolutely and in fact the southern gas cornered or that we've been talking about is um the one that stretches up from the Caspian Sea is a right to mention across\nA ... and turkey but then a\nFirm turned up it turns into top uh from turkey to Greece obey any entity but uh we the connector I'm Talking about is a new one it is that it is not being built yet and they sent their connector a connects Greece from basically tap Greece to Bulgaria\nThat is that's very interesting project to key one\nBecause they brought in not only as I said full Bulgaria now as such but for the entire region because it increases predictability a of supply and ed it provides additional opportunities for for a wider I'm ... to benefit from this resources\nAnd Bulgaria needs energy to grow all countries need energy to grow and it's not obvious where they're going to gain that except from well there are competitors ... there's Russian gas\nNineteen eighty two wasn't an engineer he wasn't especially close nowhere near as close as\nTwenty sixteen but in any about Ronald Reagan at that point was dealing with the recession or a very very difficult economic environment because of the inflation that he did it come from the Nineteen seventies and the oil ... of the oil shocks and\nThe Democratic party was very comfortable in control of Congress had been for thirty forty fifty years Laura a very good evening to you watch jaws Nineteen eighty to show us about where we are in twenty Eighteen good evening\nGood evening John thanks so much for having me on well I Do think Nineteen eighty two is a fascinating year to go back and look at first of all we had a Republican president\nUm who was facing his first midterm which has obviously where we are in today's world in twenty teens but what is also interesting about\nThat year is that it is in fact the same group of Senate seats that\nWere up that year that are also up this year so when we go back and we know that every senator served six years in the Senate when we actually go back thirty six years from this year we get to Nineteen eighty two so this is the same classes\nOf senators that are standing\nFor election we also had essentially a new\nPresident who\nThe country wasn't really certain about in fact his approval rating within the low forties that range between about forty one forty two percent and what you ended up having was a year where the president's party a lost twenty six seats in the house but they picked up one seat in the Senate\nAnd losing in the house the house did not change hands as I recall the if the Democrats were comfortably in control but that those twenty six seats gave the Democrats decided advantage I was you were going into eighty four\nThat's exactly right so what we're really talking about here is that the Democrats were already in control but with Reagan's when in Nineteen eighty he had had some coat tails and had brought 'em some Republicans with him\nYou saw the Republican I'm conference shrink um shrink by twenty six seats after eighty two and that made it really in some ways the reason why Ronald Reagan had to start working with Tip O'Neill\nWas because it forced them to find those compromises because he just didn't have enough\nOf even a minority in Congress to do a lot with\nOr I'd four weeks ago were doing political science here on the midterm uh twenty Eighteen someday forty years hence someone will have this conversation about twenty eight in the sea right they're fine we're going to divide it into pieces\nThe house that we've been addressing right now in the Senate post cabinet because that looks to be the event of the moment although the hurricane surrounding us and that could change the voting significant states like Florida Georgia\nOh Laura in the house of representatives right now I have not seen and I have not heard from conversations any significant change in the house races that are most at issue which would be the suburban districts\nWhere the district went from Mrs Clinton over over Donald Trump but it has a Republican representative at this moment have you seen a cabin are changing those districts\n[noise] no I think if anything what we're seeing is that sort of more of those college educated white women in the suburbs um I think\nThe cabinet situation help them make up their mind and mostly help them um make up their mind against the Republican Party um if you look at some of the underlined data what\nHas been most fascinating to me and the recent polls is it it appears as though the to swing groups now in the actual electorate are I'm college educated white men\nThey are now split essentially um I think the last poll I saw said forty nine forty nine between the two parties in terms of which party they favor and\nI'm white and blue collar women\nUm who are still leaning Republican\nI'm forty nine to forty five but are much closer than they were when I'm Trump was elected in twenty sixty so what we have right now is that the white college educated women have moved more decisively in to the Democratic camp\nThe um blue collar white men are decisively in the Republican camp but there I'm sort of spouses and mates and friends are not\nNo we go to the numbers that I had over the last week I have had twenty three losses which is the best case for the Republicans and thirty three losses which would give control to Nancy Pelosi do you see anything in that range Lara from your information\nWell I Do think we're probably\nStarting up more toward the thirty five or I'm forty seats and the reason why I say that is right now if you look at the cook Political Report they've already raided Fifteen\nRepublican held seats as leaning democratic or likely democratic so if you're already starting with Fifteen before you even move to the twenty nine tossup seats\nThan it it starts to become pretty easy to get above thirty because if you just assume that out of the twenty nine tossup seeds fourteen or Fifteen in other words half of those are going to go democratic\nAnd then you add them to the Fifteen that are already there you're already it's thirty and that doesn't even include the twenty five Republican held seats that are leaning\nRepublican but are certainly I'm more up for grabs so I I Do think\nOne of the things that makes this different than Nineteen eighty two is that our um parties and our country has sorted more and the polarization is much more real and it's also true that Republicans hold many more seats and they held\nIn Nineteen eighty two and that in and of itself makes them more vulnerable\nIn the Senate magic and I want to go to the you know please I was just going to say so\nI imagine what you're looking at is something more like thirty five forty seats rather than twenty six\nIn the Senate much more difficult post capital we hear stories the momentum I certainly see the Chester is a toss up\nOr the strength was clear when you saw a mansion vote for a for Kavanaugh that secures him in West Virginia\nMcCaskill in the high camp became under question but the places that I'm paying attention to our Tennessee where we've seen good numbers for black burning these last days and Florida where we've seen good numbers for Nelson\nSo right now in Nineteen eighty to the Republicans picked up\nOne is that credible for you will pick up a one seat with the numbers and we're seeing now\nI wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being up to or maybe even a plus three but a lot and that would be a net gain on because a lot of that and how do those two open seats\nReally do land I don't know that we have an understanding of which way Arizona's going or which way Tennessee is going I think there's also kind of the wild card about Texas\nUm just because we're such a strong candidate he has a raise 'em as much if not more money than I'm Ted Cruz at this point and I do think\nThat there is some difficulties for Senator Ted Cruz in a\n\n\n\n\nHouse\n[noise]\nSeventies you want to say around Bob Brown stories and we

begin with the gathering of eagles and the\nFall of Nineteen Seventy but there are restless there are many characters here who have made escape attempts over the over time they have skill sets but they've been individuals' escaping we're about to see the construction of a mass escape it will be recognizable to\nNeal block a and block be they're looking for a way out and they see in the springtime and in the summertime and through the end of the fall before winter closes there's a rice field or near a block be how is it that they come to decide on a tunnel from block be\nWell they they attempted many ways out they as soon as they got a new camping in the fall Nineteen Seventeen the recon order it and try to figure out a way to numerous attempts to get out jumping fences break into walls nothing works\nRiding out in the garbage bin ...\nUm you know any number of ah perplexing it down and they ultimately decide that the tunnels really the only way to get out from underneath a these three series of of of walls\nAnd so they begin um but first they need a place to start the tunnel and in block be a there was some stairwells that went down to the sellers and there was a partition wall that sort of blocked out underneath the stairwell\n... arguably so that prisoners couldn't jump out at the guards coming down the steps but what it became was the perfect entry point\nA hidden underneath the stairwell where they could start a tunnel through the wall and then to the closest a field\nThe officers are taking the tunnel but there are um soldiers allied soldiers president who are orderly who are treated as servants are Batman and the Germans do not regard them as suspicious so our officers masquerade as as orderly is that how they could act it is because black\nBe is basically a divided into an officer section in an orderly section and this there was a new orderly section so they need to recruit some orderly to help them provide uniforms\nAnd then the officers a change in a room walk across the yard go into the orderly quarters go down the steps go through this fake wall that they engineer or to tap open and close that uh seamlessly so it could be discovered to begin the\nTone yes and they see the rye fields and they know that as they begin in December this concept of tunneling they're going to need to get all out there and they estimate the number of yards any forty fifty yards to the rye field so the rye won't be back till spring time so it's time to dig\nBut before we did they also recruited people from the camp\nI have down my list here let her boys senator man the tide ms and Curt growl from India let's talk about letter boy who was he\nLetter boy was was one of the individual in the mayor's office uh and so was able to provide\nVarious

them\nI'm Joe the guards were sort of more open to helping the prisoners if the barrage of a right\nAnd that's letter boy sanitary man was not was a civilian and they they persuaded him with presents

and the men were being um support it almost wholly by\nWhat was being sent home front\nRight their breakfast was bitter coffee usually the correct acorns and acorn or and so they recruit people from the cap they have the order lays who cannot escape with them because of the orderly are caught there'll be ...\nCorrect I mean if you were an orderly and you were caught his gaping I it was it was in many ways a death sentence because you would then be sent to a coal mine or salt mine or other other work camp a that was very brutal uh and the life expectancy life expectancy of those cancers

which was so small that you could barely even raise yourself up on your elbows right\nNow everybody has a feeling of claustrophobia and every time I watched the great escape I have that feeling there was a wonderful twilight zone episode was about a tunnel where the men got stuck on the tunnel and that was the scary and nobody knew how to get him out that's about to happen\nThey start the tunnel
