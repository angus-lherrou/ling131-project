is Dr Lederman Harvard train trip a board certified cancer doctor worked at thirty for Broadway talking about the patients I've seen the last few days that we can learn together and we cannot make the same mistakes we can learn from them\nA sixty three year old woman she came in to me she's married her husband's on hospice which means he has\nJust dying and she's taking care of her husband she has a child chose diabetes and heart failure cut extensive shed a routine scan of her chest and she was found to have a mass in the chest shut a chest X ray which is negative so the other teaching point chest X rays not equal to a C. D. scan\nKeep that in my chest X rays old technology see tea is more recent technology this woman smoked for forty nine years you can see lots of sides around New York\nTalking about scanning for cancer and ... smokers well\nWoman got scared and she was found to have a mass shut a biopsy\nThe biopsy showed adenoids cystic cancer in the long though often that no it's just a cancer started in the head and neck area of the mouth area or throat area\nAnd she was staged up she had multiple scans and ... and looks she's lost wage from one thirty five to one thirty she's four foot ten inches tall [noise]\nHas a smash up multiple medications examines her she has a mass in the town so we got checked out it was negative so she has a primary cancer adenoids cystic cancer in the long [noise]\nAnd of course the surge has one of the cod are open they wanted to cut up on her chest and throw the long into a pocket and she would never have that long to breathe are gathered she understood that\nWith surgery there's complications opening up collapse in the long I've ease to hospital stays in factions\nAnd she would never have that long back along they threw in the garbage would never come back to help her grieve\nAnd so she came here or friends who are radio listeners like you older to check it out and she checked it out and she liked the fact that with us we have high success rates for treating lung cancers and we treat lung cancers everyday\nFirst in America with radio surgery for every reason of the body\nAnd first in America for radio surgery of lung cancer so if you have a lung cancer or cancer the travel along a lung cancer is a cancer starts the lungs and a metastases to the longest a cancer travels to the long we treat both have the ability to treat both this woman\nShows us because she wanted an outpatient therapy she didn't want to be in a hospital she didn't want to be away from her husband who was so sick\nJoined in the hospital anyway so you don't want to be cutting she won her along the collapse you didn't want to lose that lung function should want to be short of breath after they cut out her long no\nAll those were reasons that she chose radio surgery non invasive treatments and when you call her office and get our book what you'll see lots of examples of lung cancer is ...\nOr an after our treatment patients we treated with lung cancer lung metastases thousands over the years this is the work that we do every\nDay when I brought body right do surgery to America what it was a scam you know\nJust those doctors were defensive because they knew that there'd be less surgery because there's less reason to have surgery there's less chemo because there's less reason for chemo there's less standard radiation because there's less reason\nFor all those old style treatments when you can have new innovative pinpoint treatment for lung cancers pancreas liver and bladder prostate of cola than rectum and bone and kidney cancer since are calmer melanoma and more\nWere ever war you have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being a continent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know in ... about that and events\nAre men who communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in quiz it to her I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go wrong\nIt was more like Apollo Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize oh my\nGod as you look at the ivy that used to and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in fact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad\nAnd sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was in my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease and stroke you're in good shape and still had all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only was I in good shape I was in heavy\nI wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start

I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is your doctor Gilead I mean because you're not part of the old boy's club your independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYour patients painless message of recovery fully\nRemaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nYou know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing the robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars have I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be turning them into a person who can no longer physically\nFunction why am I doing this when there are other remedies and why are they doing it because this is their business the surge and all they know how to do is cut\nOut your prostate gland that control so much of what a man does and I would suggest to everyone out there a void that at all costs don't be still not don't be a dummy like I was\nGet that valued second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and you will feel fully functional again thank you so much my pleasure\nSays Dr Lederman thank you Rob I won't talk about uh fifty three year old man there's a man who had Twenty years actually more than ... years of former\nWho was diagnosed almost Thirty years ago when he was in the air force he was having from the spleen removed and then the other masses arm ... from and they had chemotherapy for years and then you know therapy for years\nAnd then the cats are grew in his right back and they had biopsies surgery chemo chemo for two years and the cancer kept on growing and the Americans came all doctors cover all your chemo them you know therapy and then they just run out of ideas and they decided to give us a chance\nHe came to us that they are today for Broadway and we states them up we've found is lymphoma there's ... in his left that broke the color boat he was born in St Vincent's island in the Caribbean\nIs computer programmer great man and he had multiple nodules or Mac\n[noise] didn't respond to Kimmo didn't respond to him and know therapy came to us in the ... more than two years ago we treated him\nAnd he's now cancer freezer meant cancer free with all the cables doesn't work and all that ... therapy doesn't work you came to us as a last resort and now his cancer free doing well working and caring on normally is a good way with excellent quality of life\nRobot other woman I was talking about with a massive cancer of the right breast was a fun getting cancer we treated her she's now also in remission with our trip and we see so many women with early and late breast cancer coming to us for treatment wherever\nBook with about radio surgery or of the breast your car office of two and two choices\nMany women with advanced breast cancer things there is no help until they come to us a third to before Broadway\nWe're back at nine to allow them tonight at\nMidnight on W. are if you have questions call us at two on two choices to one to two four six forty two thirty seven months after leader minister ... ... email ...

not new\nOh what a woman comedian does what was your job as a woman comedian for late night with David Letterman\nWell I'm every show has been warm up comedian and when I was living in LA and Emerson graduated was the uh associate producer of saved by the bell oh now I was making you know twenty bucks a night of the comedy store just barely surviving and he offered me a job a thousand bucks a week to warm up saved by the bell\nNow that it was awful in every way because it was babysitting and it was you know it wasn't really a fun job but it was great money and it was across the hall from the Knight Joe with Johnny Carson which was literally a six feet from the Tonight Show which was very exciting and I got some nice people\nBut ... ... just Iceland nice people as well as a kid you know everyone was there a very young kids and they were nice enough\nBut um it started getting me and and the jobs and I worked at the Dana carpet shows the warm up\nAnd then the people who work there were working at Letterman and they recommended me when Letterman needed a warm up and pretty much I'm you know it's like\nThe ... best way to describe it as you're a car is cold in the winter and you get someone to get in the car and warm it up for you know that the person who owns the car and drive off so my job was to really get the audience in you know ready to go for days and I knew him so well in what he wanted and how we needed the audience to be\nAnd uh was able to set it up for him because it wasn't like a kind of a set up was more like he was very intelligent and he he also like you know it's kind of caught\nCombination of intelligence and silliness and and that's what I did to get them ready for Dave\nSo outlandish ... parlayed that into being the stand up comedies Allen quarter and\nWell I got close to him I'm the first year and I was able to come to the desk and every commercial break and we go over\nYou know different segments and we start talking about stand ups and he loves stand up was a stand up and a little by little that one time the ... that ah you know Joey Friedman the great snowy Friedman who got an incredible job of Comedy Central which will do the book and they needed a book or and he said how 'bout you do it\nAnd I said huh [laughter] I says you know it's pretty bad at all these people are going to want to be on the show thousands of people and he doesn't who cares do it\nSo I ended up doing it and uh I did that for eleven years ...\nSo I did the David Letterman show the first year when he was on when he'd be a right or that summer the first summer and or\nDid not have the greatest experience frilly my first network yeah we do is set or I did is set to actually do the set but what happened was somebody had cancelled I ...

played great Beatles song will lead you know with his shirt fat so and um so the day before I let them it's like what should I ask Paul you know you have any ideas and I said the week before Michael Jackson it passed in my first thought was what's going to happen to the beat them using that Michael Jackson as you could oh great okay\nSo the next day or you know they set up a card with Michael Jackson's photo and everything in the first segment goes by McCartney and Letterman talk and they don't bring that up so much Letterman gets up to go talk to reduce them at the desk gets me and McCartney and I'm\nLike I gave him ahead not he gives me ahead not back\nSo I Walk over and I just say you know I was wondering about the when the Michael Jackson stuff and goes oh yeah the Michael I'm not going to ... I was going to try but not as a I was wondering too and I looked it up and I think we get it eventually and it was just great to just talking to him and\nWe had like three or four minutes subject and then I Walk back and then the next segment so let him go so how about the Michael Jackson stuff\nAnd he was ready for it because of him and I talked about it so now it was one of the greatest conversations that was talked about in magazines and newspapers all over the world that whole Michael Jackson section was it was all really important so now I'm freaking out and then you know I was freaking out now I'm double freak\nSo now we go to the market because my car and he's going to be on the marquee and I'm up on the marquee with McCartney and hanging out over there\nHe's always playing on top of the market\nAnd then so he plays a couple of songs and I know that he's going to do another whole section and it's like a million people on the street so I Walk downstairs and I watched that extra section that they do from downstairs and it just ... I Can't believe that I met this beetle talk to them set the segment up all that and then I get in a camp to go home uh and I shook\nLike a leaf because I realized oh my God I just had a thing with McCartney while I was happy it's like yeah\nSo anyway McCartney you know and by way of doing that God help and uh it it was one of the greatest stays in my life yeah\nAmazing name so suggested I\nBuy it has happened to me and I'm Jealous that was when I hear a jealous of yourself as a damn him Mary [laughter]\nI Would ... well I mean [noise]\nI\nI Wonder who can that be at the door [noise] man how long how long has me Paul\n\nMcHugh one poll economy that's right you know beetles Lola\nI'm married to an American now you know from New Jersey if you can believe it but at least this one's going to look to stand on what we live in long island's eastern demagogic and somebody off the community and made me want to explore my horizons as an artist so I'm open to stay to the theater where you can see me live this summer activities\nSome plays and stuff\nThe ... theater where you can see classics of the stage and done on a five course gourmet Reagan dinner this week Paul McCartney is Alexander Hamilton in Hamilton\nI'm gonna get a scholarship to kings college I probably should brag but that got amazing the stomach problem is I got a lot of brains when the polish I've got a hold on just to be heard with the root of knowledge I'm just like my country I'm young scrappy and hungry and I am not throwing away my shot with\nTVs Perry Mason and Star Wars sides Raymond Burr as Aaron Burr\n[noise] Alexandra how soon\nCan we agree that dogs are dumb and Mitchell sure ... sufferers woods with his life we both know that's absurd so\nHang on how many men died because he was an experienced in ruins\nOkay so we're doing this [noise]\nHave in common with the downtrodden poor boys wanted more\nShows of oh who was nobody's who\nTo cruise to school like in the rooms\nAnd he he did get\nNo fake [noise] does\nYour rent it brings\nTo the needs of those like in the band when he brings ... as the ...\nSongs on the table some history built in to the mall and they need\nTo be here and there and everywhere and on the road from my ...

month Thanksgiving weekend as a new my father's place at the rousing okay I'll\nSee you next week everybody learn other episodes that Rob Bartlett radio comedy our right here on the Seventy seven we have these shady [noise]\nSome jumped off the bridge others just made their way to another section of the river that separates the two countries and made it across that way\n\nThe group is now ... trying to because they went over the bridge and all different ways\nThe group is now trying to reform the caravan and the border city of ... so there are about two thousand now about a thousand of going back about two thousand now and they vowed to continue their track\nTo the United states which is about Fifteen hundred miles away Fifteen hundred miles away there go and how many of the two thousand I think it's going to make all the way all the way from the Guatemalan border to the U.S border I I think the numbers are going to dwindle a lot and especially\nBecause the Mexican police and the Mexicans are going to be all over them because now they now they're working with the United states\nAnd look I get I understand many of these people come from crime rate in impoverished countries with no work available and they're looking for something better but that doesn't mean they get to force their way into our country no matter what their messages\nWere not criminals coming over here because we want to work when he got better you know a quarter like that's why we're here\nYou understand that President Trump is going to use the pictures of thousands of people surging through the gates against you interact with people and say this is a scary\nIs that while they were aware of what our president President or not if they have all the respect you know we don't we're not\nYet no look I I don't think the vast majority are but Donald Trump has warned that there is a bad element in the caravan so he is using this there's no question is using this caravan right now\n\nAnd that there there is a bad element he's saying using hiding among the the masses of people to gain access to the United states\nAnd the president said he's willing to get the military involved in stopping them\nI Would call it in the military and I were to offer for our close up the broader if that happens\nAnd if that continues to move forward the caravan we're talking about which is I think a man made caravan you want to know that I think some bad people started at ...\nMore importantly or maybe most importantly\nYou'll have some very very bad people in the care of and you have some very tough criminal elements within the caravan [noise] but I Will seal off the border before they come into this kind of bring out our military is not our reserves are bringing out our military\nSo now we have a line being drawn\nIn the sands of Arizona the line being drawn in the sands of Mexico right before the midterm elections this is now a mid term election issue by the way\nEverything is about the midterms cabinet about them in terms\nTo show ... about the mid term everything is about the mid term elections Donald Trump on his side of the wind is willing to bring in the military to stop the thousands of people\nWho want to enter the country illegally and mess I guess I could apply for asylum some of them but given the stories like not being able to get a job that doesn't get you asylum you know you can feel bad for them you can go as the stakes that your your country such such bad shape\nThat not enough people can get jobs but sorry we have a legal way of getting into this country we can't accept everybody in the world that's impoverished and just because you made the trek up here doesn't mean you get injury\nLook I I Know a lot of you were buying into this claim that the caravan was funded by George Soros and the Democrats did they get set up another crisis at the border from the mid term I'm not sure about that\nBecause first of all there's no proof of that and even the president right now is backing off of that just a little bit\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of and it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan\nSee now instead of coming out and accusing the Democrats of starting to care of and what you did just a couple of days ago today when he was in the ...\nBut uh he's saying a lot of people say which he loves to say when he doesn't wanna accused directly a lot of people say I wonder who started the care of it\nSo it's not even saying they did it but he's saying they like it I Will say this that if the Democrats did start this caravan if they've promoted this if they paid for it it was stupid stupid stupid politics\nThis is now being used by Donald Trump to stir up the Republican base this is a Republican issue\nImmigration wasn't even a big issue in this mid term until this caravan this this help get Donald Trump elected\nYou're playing right into his hands Kavanaugh caravan Kavanaugh caravan right into his hands because one of the major two things that he got elected on was putting conservatism the Supreme Court Kavanaugh and dealing with illegal immigration caravan\n\nSo I that's why I don't think the Democrats were that stupid to start this caravan right now when they\nWhen the issue would they would have the issue to be healthcare have you noticed that it's difficult to find Democrat talking about this caravan right now if they were using this if they started it if they wanted this for the midterms they'd be talking more about it you see the problem is\nWhat they wanted with the pictures at the border they didn't want the track the mass\nThe book the bridge filled with people along the way they don't want that picture\nThey don't want the Mexican police lined up across the river trying to stop\nPeople from Guatemala migrants from Guatemala and migrants from Honduras coming into their country\nWhat they want is a month from now what they want is\nTo see the thing is it didn't even time out if they did this and they're not going to make it in sixteen\nDays or they can they can they go I guess they can get single hundred miles a day right you can walk a hundred miles a day that's a lot for a family\nYou know you have kids in tow and stuff like that that's a lot isn't it a hundred miles a day ... let's figure it out if you walked eight hours a day and let's say you walk\nEven ten miles an hour that's a that's a good pace that's neat nobody walks ten miles an hour right so let's say you work ten hours and get it for miles an hour\nRight that's that's the only forty miles sixteen\nDays it's four hundred what\nSix hundred and forty miles you're making it you don't make it in the border so you wouldn't even tiny amount of time so this is truly a Republican issue it just made no sense for the Democrats did is they already had the enthusiasm about the midterms\nThey didn't need an issue that riled up the Republican base more than the Democratic base and that's exactly what they got\n\nBut maybe the most important thing out of this and it's being under reported it's not being talked about it because in the media they don't want to talk about things that\nAre positive for Donald Trump but the most amazing thing about this whole thing\nThis is brought in Mexico and the United states closer together\nMexico doesn't one thousands of migrants making their way through Mexico any more than we want them showing up at our border\nMexico has agreed to help this is after the trade deal was struck now they're helping us think about it the government of Mexico has agreed to work\nWith the United states in stopping illegal immigration\nThat's mind blowing that\nIs the headline of this story and it's not being reported enough one eight hundred eight foray WABC one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to Andy B from Staten Island you're Seventy seven WABC\n... how are you Andy\nFifteen hundred miles [laughter] Fifteen days\n[laughter]\nNo not six years so it would have personnel idea yet\nThat's far but I I went outside support I mean do you need food and supplies for that amount of people yeah\nThey are getting support along the way I mean the Mexican government's having them out so you so you buy into the thing that this is a democratic blood it doesn't make any sense it\nCome from somewhere like in that area this is the supporters of the Democrats\nWill ... will be stupid politics if they did I mean I don't I don't get it first of all they're not going to make it easier in time right to because if you want those pictures of families being separated at the border which is what the theory is there not make it they had to leave earlier than this so that's that doesn't make any sense and\nMan would they weren't hundred dollar bills of all they weren't hundred dollar bills I've seen that I've seen the video most of the people get a like a book yeah it's not there weren't hundred dollar bills and and they're thinking that it was actually the cartels that was giving them money\nBecause they're trying to buy favor or from the people in in that area but um that wasn't it wasn't George Soros I mean I don't look I have no proof that it wasn't so your theory is as good as mine but I'm going by the reports that I saw I just don't it doesn't make sense does it\nMaybe you're right because you you know I I got a good angle and I I haven't really seen that Democrats been because you know the one word they'd be using right now which Hillary used to use in a campaign would be the scene of full angle you know what I mean\nI have an accent that no they're hiding from this\nI think they want this to go away I I just does not help for hours by laugh you know I just don't think it helps them I I don't think they're embarrassed by anything and politicians earning verify anything but I I don't think it helps them I think if they believe this would help them in the midterms it'd be all over this so I Want to know\nYour prediction Larry now hang up and I know you've got colder commercials or what do you think is it going to be a red wave or a blue wave your honest opinion there\nWell I think that the Republicans may pick up seats in the Senate I Believe the they're going to lose the house\nWow that's what I told my wife I think the house has gone to the Democrats and we're going to pick up some seats in the Senate and it's going to be a shame to see all these agenda that Donald Trump wants to get to be all that a little bit you know not much but a little bit\nIt may help him because it every president does better when they have an arch enemy and so he'll be able to look at the house and and go after them and I think it might help them in the long run but all these investigations are going to start against Donald Trump and the gay think it might I don't know\nI think if I I got a funny feeling it's going to unleash the uh the crack you know I Wish to crack and they say what Donald Trump that that happens\nI blew you might be right I'm going to get going but thanks a lot low in and he needs a villain we saw that in the campaign he needs somebody to go after and so if it's Nancy Pelosi if she\nIt was house speaker again oh my goodness he is he going to have fun with that\nHe's going to go after her so it may not be a bad thing and then if they get if they overplay their hand the Democrats overplay their hand into investigation after investigation after investigation the public might turn on them so we'll have to see Tony from the Bronx you're on Seventy seven WDC\nAnd a lot of good evening Hi Tony I'm a I think it's irrelevant you know throwing cars behind her I I think it's even irrelevant of free with than than our dollar bills or fifty dollars or five hundred

as well\nThe reason we have twenty five million illegal in this country and if not eleven million would CNN MSNBC and all the other big news channels have been saying for the last twenty five years\nThe reason we have the twenty five million illegal it could be accurate number is because it could joke nothing is ever done ... that people all across this border every day and they laugh and just say\nYou know I Know what I'm Talking about I understand only half of the legal immigration is the people coming over the border the other half are staying because then there'd be the\nOnes out there that they work at a school that they they just say that I'm not going to go back to my country is going to stay here that's why I'm also for hiring more\nFederal attorneys and more ice agents to find them and then don't tired to court and to have more Chinese and deport them as well the Democrats are in the house\nNothing will happen we need you verify we need less immigration and through my

call I think you're right I I you're absolutely correct that\n... that Vince George Soros sort of the Democrats really is irrelevant I I think that as a talking point for the Republicans to attack the Democrats and\nIt it it everything's about them in terms now so it all plays in the midterms you're absolutely right not having a job or being impoverished is not does not get you asylum you can't just claim that\nYou can claim that there's crime rate and you can claim that your government some more you can clean political reasons and it may or may not work but just simply showing up and saying

I think George Soros is behind a lot\nOf\nA lot of the protests and the so called mobs in America but I it just doesn't make any sense he's behind this when it it really doesn't add up\n\nAnd let you know you're saying that the argument against it as well just didn't plan this as well and they did it backfiring on them and it's great that it's backfiring\nOn the no the Democrats even haven't even been out in front of them that they're not even claiming they once said\nThey were on their way to winning this mid term especially in the house they don't want this all the sudden in Arizona and New Mexico and Texas\nBy the way the the the rally tomorrow in Texas with Trump for for Ted Cruz Seventy five thousand signed up for that I Will I'll get will will take some more calls on this when we come right back\nBut but listening to unlimited he he loses his train of thought and he says a couple of things that are absolutely absurd and threatening to date to deploy the military to shut down the border\nEven though the ... act forbids for bids using the military\nFor suburban duty some military bases suburban duty [laughter]\nFrom bend them from suburban duties you can't make them work at an orange Julius ... chair you can't make them go and plant flowers suburban duties\nWhat the heck\nHe lost his place on the prompt and you could see it in his eyes you can see that he had he just came up with suburban they can drive around in station wagons no no\nI don't even know what's suburban duties are here's here's the way that he could send a if you just cracks me up he was so\nProud\nThat he got posse Kevin taught us up that's what he was proud of you got to use that you know what I'm Talking about positive Kevin taught us that has something to do with the suburbs\nWhile\nHe never ceases to amaze me that he is on the I I again I told you before that I work with them and and the fact that he has his own show on CNN says so much about CNN and what they're all about\nI just don't know I don't think they can get rid of them I don't think I think they'd like to get rid of them they just can't see it gets horrible ratings he comes in of the\nI Believe out of the four cable news stations the top four he comes in fourth\nIn that time slot and then Rachel Maddow shoots up\nBut here's here's the way that Donald Trump could send the military to the border he would have to declare an emergency a national emergency which you could if ... people were coming to the border to get over he could declare national emergency get away with that\nAnd then he would have to get a waiver from Congress which the Republicans have the house in the Senate my feeling is the big granted the waiver maybe not my feeling is that granted the waiver so it is possible he could do that or you could use the national guard\nAnd he has enough states that would allow them to use the national guard that he could he could do that\nSo incredibly Don Lemon wrong once again one\nEight hundred aid for a WABC Peter from Middletown urine Seventy seven WABC\nGreat stuff as always um listen we have all these activists judges they block all the laws whether it's immigration we have no enforcement I'm so why doesn't the president just change the rules at the border let everyone and\nGive them healthcare give them daycare give them education give them everything they want but you couldn't scripted them all\nNow you work for me tomorrow the bus comes we take you from a military base we're going to work on some bridges were going to pay the next week we're going to do another chore and then I tell you no one will come to this\nCountry how about if you had to build the wall it or or even that Larry but it will stop\nIf they're coming here to really work and then you're going to give him work and tell them what work they're gonna do and how they're going to become American citizens it's not no one's going to come I don't care if the Somali Russian Albanian dreamers\nThey're not going to come they're going to lose their what they really want they want to get stuff when they get here and and they of course they're entitled to their human dignity but you can have\n... you know everybody just coming in as this big group no heat right even if you I I agree ... script them all put them all to do something okay yeah I don't want your case should remove well education all the stuff we do and no one will it will be a different scenario\nI well I I don't think that I don't think that's true because you're again well Peter you're you're painting with two way too broad a brush I\nAnd I can't tell you\nI Would never try to paint with that brought up a brush and say they all do this they are they all want this but I Will say that I have in pure ethical proof I've had first hand knowledge of people that have come to this country when I Lived in California\nAnd and worked hard and and didn't get any government help and then they hit out\nIn the in in some of the areas than just a matter of fact some of the forest fire some of the horrible fires out there started because of some of the immigrants cooking in a in some of the wooded areas or in the dry grass but it was these people\nWere working hard that show up at your door the knock on your door that aspirin for about ... I feel bad for them to be your bigger point which I agree with\nWas you can't take everybody just because they're poor\nIf if we need migrant workers if we really do need migrant workers which is the where the argument then there should be an annual work\nVisa\nNot citizenship just an enemy and you will work\n\nAs many homeless people you see on the street\nYou know what you're talking about one country\nEvery country in Latin America is capable people some ... the very people at the top and everybody else eating crumb\nYou're saying every few got a few got it and most people are uh they lucky they get one square meals a day right\nAnd they're not all capitals countries right those yeah it's almost every one of them is a capitalist country that's what you're saying El Salvador's the capitals country\nYes okay they're not they know they're not yet\nThey oh they're not their job we we can keep saying yes they are no there or not but they're not\nYou could argue with the fact you could argue the facts are facts are facts\nWith you and you're saying what you believe is affect what I'm saying is not a fact I'll tell you what will will look it up we'll talk about it Mike from queens you're in Seventy seven WDC\nYeah great show or listen I'm I've just noticed lately that the Democrats seem\nLike they hit their wagging the keeping people poor and they don't want to let anybody out of the box economic I Want to keep the base of poverty with like food stamps welfare and free college and blah blah blah and it it just seems all this uh it's not even negativity it it seems like the scheme\nWhere like where they won't give Trump an instance they are like wow you know the economy coming back in the ... they're getting from jobs going that just seen where they have this investment\nIn to maintain a poverty bait\nAnd I mean uh hypothetically you could get very well in public housing Niger it's a disaster you could get every man woman and child a voucher for fifty thousand grand move out tomorrow the city could sell the buildings and everybody would live happily ever after but I'm just wondering Europe's of age and as far\nAs the old Democratic Party used to be about labor in people getting jobs and housing I don't hear a lot of stuff or where they're talking about\nA jobs they just talk about you know getting like\nUh the doom and gloom a thing going and it's a very negative it very creepy ah your your observations I'll take my answer off the air to a great job either\nThanks a lot like you I agree with you I think that I think the issue of jobs has been taken away from them believe me they would love to run in the economy they would love to run on the fact that there's not enough jobs Donald Trump stole that from them and even when you're talking about union jobs he's help with union jobs as well\nSo and and he's not anti union at all and so that issue has been taken from them that's why you don't hear about it and also the media just goes along with them they are they doom and gloom right now yes and it's a weird that they can get away with it so\nThey're running a campaign solely on personality\nOn the fact that I just heard Bernie Sanders today I listen to his speech and Bernie Sanders talking about how Donald Trump is embarrassing and we don't want our children to hear Donald Trump or learn from Donald Trump\nSo you're right this is an odd campaign but it's working and when Donald Trump comes out and says that they're still upset that they lost the two thousand sixteen election he's right there was this immediate anger this immediate resistance on the streets\nAnd that's why the Democrats are going to do well in the house and not the Senate because when you have these pockets these democratic pockets around the country needs congressional districts they're going to do well state wide it doesn't work as well\nSo Claire McCaskill's in trouble in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp sin is going to lose ... questions you lose a Montana North Dakota's him play again with tester\nNelson might lose in Florida so there's many seats that the Republicans pick can pick up because state wide these arguments don't work as well but you're absolutely correct so state wide economic issues still matter defense issue still matter\nBuddy in pockets around the country the attack on Donald Trump the idea that somehow ... and ... and dangerous that does work so you're right it is there is this doom and gloom minute all centers around Donald Trump were coming back after this [noise]\nGreen perfect timing matters leases
