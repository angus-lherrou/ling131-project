coming into our country\nOr that they are using it to make other products so it is something that's being talked about more and more because after all\nUh the terrorists have been in place longer pay country uh companies are beginning to see what impact that having on their costs makeup and so forth so it's a bit more of the conversation certainly now that it was three months ago\nUm but all that said here here are the things that people have to kinda keep foremost\nIn their minds number one earnings are up about twenty five percent in this quarter and the third quarter which is\nAbove the expectation is a I don't think that's going to disappear the next year companies will not have the advantage of lower tax rate ... will be tougher but so far you're still looking at putting good earnings games for the fourth quarter and I think beyond\nWhy because we're still growing and the best news I think that came out today is that consumer confidence was off the charts I don't mean up a modest amount it was at an Eighteen year\nHigh consumer confidence what does that tell me that tells me we're going to have a gang busters fourth quarter\nBecause that is driven very heavily by holiday sales and I think a consumer is going into that quarter feeling flush uh and ready to spend a lot of money and I mentioned that particularly because when Amazon reported their earnings which was viewed\nAs the earnings themselves were excellent but the guy was going forward including for the fourth quarter was rather tempered a people sort of interpreted that immediately\nAs having to do with a slow down on consumer spending I Do not and I don't think Amazon ever really presented it that way or it had to do with other businesses that they're trying to launch 'em and various other factors but I did not meet that I'm as a negative about the fourth quarter I think we'll get a very good fourth quarter\nLoose starting with the start of the wall street for just a moment I was talk over these last decades always listening\nThat rotation in the ... into growth stocks consumer stock staples a is what happens in anticipation of a recession what recession we're the stock market is rotating now is if they are guaranteed that are going to be layoffs comes summer of twenty Nineteen does anybody think that's accurate\n[noise] well I think they only I Know I I don't see a recession and all that data that goes into forecasting the recession\nUnlike leading indicators and by the way stock prices and things like that really don't look that way to me at all they are also struggling a lot of them with a getting into businesses that are more competitive I I don't hear much talk about this but they're all talking about cloud services for example\nAs a big area of growth well guess what they are a lot of big companies a cloud atlas I was the biggest uh but they're not the only company in that in this in\nMy car that often IBM or both competitive amateur and oracle\nI mean there's a whole bunch of companies so you know I think\nA little bit when you're talking about searched Google ... apparently Google controlled something unbelievable like eighty five percent right of all search they do not control eighty five percent of anything else so I think that's an issue\nAnd finally Facebook a report it today and they beat estimates as as a lot of companies have this quarter um but in the stock was taken down at one point six percent because again there guidance as in very good well what's ... what's their problem partly again trying to gin up\nA business is like messaging where they have some increase competition but also um ... they are having to add a lot of people to monitor their site and you know a lot of ah there's been a lot of\nPolitical unrest about hate speech showing up on 'em ... news on these platforms like ... a Facebook also a fake news showing up interference with the elections all this kind of stop well how does Facebook really\nMonitor two billion users a day the answer is they do but they're adding lots and lots of people to look like they're trying uh whether or not that successful we'll see I don't particularly think there's going to be\nUm but the cost and create so that was pretty significant other quarter an effort to\nBefore we go to politics straight up and talk about the polling and the weaknesses and strengths of the parties is is the market reflecting in some way anxiety about the mid term yeah are they over interpreting events as they do because they're selling stock they're not buying stuff\nIt's a good question and uh I don't know the answer to that I think most people have felt for some time that there was going to be a a takeover by Democrats at\nThe high rise that it is right up political science yes Democratic House yes\nExactly and that the Republicans control the Senate since that is still the prevailing wisdom I don't think the market would be trading or radically on that basis but you know you don't know um\nAnd and I got to tell you or we will get into this but if in fact the Nancy Pelosi Adam Schiff Maxine Waters group\nTakeover significant committees in the house it is it a question of nothing getting done it's a question of endless investigation into the White House and to President Trump\nIs going to be extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable and I think people who are sort of thinking about as light view that as a negative for the stock market but let me up at at one thing\nBecause of the ups and downs of the market because the latest waiting in that third quarter report of inflation was well below Orwell would then I should say that as a desire court or the expectations of a bad hike in December have come back a little bit\nI don't know what they'll do

and the Caspian Sea is a region well worth\nExplicit exploring I welcome\nThe director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow my longtime colleague and friend and co host\nWho is now directing an economy that has reported three percent year over year growth exactly what candidate Trump and I'll president elect Trump and President Trump promised would be delivered to the American people year over year three percent the\nMost recent quarter the first estimate of the third quarter as three point five percent following a better than four percent in the previous quarter so Larry you're the one who would get the blame this week so you're the one who gets the credit because it's drawing a very good evening to\nThank you John happy to take credit yeah time by the way a we had a very strong in the ... the stock market the turbulence important point we had a very strong consumer sentiment numbers today unexpectedly so\nVery strong very very strong shockingly strong\nAnd really across the board and the different categories so this south they among other indicators\nThat this boom has quite a ways to go a lot of people are trying to bad habit three point five percent and the and the third quarter was good enough uh most of my friends I'm the opposite side said\nWe'd never be too We're now beginning to a four point to and the second quarter three point five\nAnd it's coming across the board profits are soaring confidence that soaring blue collar and why that is the fastest since the Nineteen eighties when I was a Cub Scout for Ronald Reagan women are re entering the workforce I mean you see it all the time without a permit rate\nOf a three point seven percent and one last point this is the supply side plan was not a demand side plan in other words\nThe corporate taxes for large and small companies and the individual tax cuts and the deregulation is creating a greater potential to growth ... why is booming right now\nAnd so not surprisingly the inflation rate is now coming back down it was hovering at about two and a half percent in the last three months it's down to one and a half percent\nSo that is another source of stimulus inflation is the coolest facts all low inflation as another tax cut\nTrump ... works and Larry as a surprise I bring on our dear colleagues Steve Moore the author most recently with art Laffer our other dear colleague of Trump ... inside of the American first plan to revive our economy Steve\nIsn't it accurate to say that Larry would get the blame so Larry gets all the credit for this to a roaring economy good evening Steve Hi John\nHi Larry ... you got a lot of his life up Larry the what was that as soon as something's going south and you're right I mean nothing is going\nOn with the economy right now it's it's almost impossible to find anything that isn't headed north in terms of jobs or whether it's a investment or whether it's a ... wages that the one thing I Would add to what Larry said that I find it interesting you know we did see\nA you know of a burst and consumer spending it in the last of the GDP report\nAnd and this I think contradicts the idea that somehow the middle class has not benefited from these policies you don't get a blockbuster consumer spending\nA number like that if if the middle class doesn't feel like they're financially better off that they're flush with cash that their paychecks are a little bigger\nAnd you know what what Americans feel like they've got a little more money in their pockets you know they they'll spend they ... they don't go to a restaurant or they'll go to the shopping mall I\nHave this this lie that's being perpetuated this election cycle that only the rich have benefited from this tax cuts is is is so exposed as alive by these consumer spending that was one other quick point you know I've been traveling a lot around the country in the last three months and everywhere I go job whether it's\nYou know Portland Maine or to Portland, Oregon all you see is construction spending it's it's the most ... opened this must be the biggest construction boom in American history with with uh with these cranes everywhere in the sky whether it's\nYou know whether it's Nashville, Tennessee or Memphis or Los Angeles or San Francisco or Denver, Colorado even Detroit and Cleveland so it's it's a ... I think Larry's right this is this is ...\n... as a boom that's hit every area of the economy\nLarry and that's that's our no go ahead Larry go ahead\nJust one quick point um I mentioned a moment ago that um\nCollar employment was rising at its fastest pace since the mid eighties um blue collar wages are rising faster than whites\nAll her wages now don't get me wrong I'm more than happy for white collar workers to succeed in fact I Want all workers to succeed in fact uh I think there's no crime and more people working successfully but it is interesting\nThat for the first time in decades the blue collar folks are gaining wages faster than the white collar folks\nAnd I think again that has a lot to do with the supply side nature of this expansion where the corporate tax rates are dropping to Twenty one percent the small business rates dropping too about Nineteen percent um that is paying off\nSo that blue collars people who own and operate their own companies and businesses and they are hiring and that's why the blue collars are doing the best they've done\nIn many decades I think that's something that again many of my good friends on the other side of the trial or they don't want to talk about it but you know it Henry Kissinger used to say\nAn argument is always better John when it has benefitted by the facts and at some point are critics will have to acknowledge the fact\nReporting on the twenty Seventeen tax and attacks and ... as tax cuts and jobs that\nAre lost in a very good evening to you or I beg pardon my ignorance when first we talked about donors tries I've now done my research and there are many reasons to go for a donor advised fund as opposed to what charitable foundation so let's plunge right into it because we have people listening and blue states in red states\nThis is in particular to where you live it has to do with how you want to direct your legacy first of all what he is a donor advised fun let's do the fundamentals good evening to you I'm\nSure we'll Thanks John glad to be a part of the ghetto let's start with the with the basics of of any a donor vice fund um they are a charitable tool that allows you to satisfy dollars while immediately receiving a tax deduction\nThe fund is legally controlled by the fund provider and you have a advisory privileges on your account\nAnd you can use money in that account immediately or it can be invested and grow tax free\nAdded ... can be open to by individuals families corporations ... foundations or even nonprofit groups I'm so any down revise fund can do all those things are and they are very useful simple tax friendly and more importantly if it matters to you private way of\nGiving us a tax fund let's concentrate on that because to Herod oh that's all the news right now we've got a mid term coming up\nTax friendly if especially in blue let's start with the blue states uh which I Am happy to participate but and I'm surrounded by blue states New Jersey Connecticut and of course New York what is the advantage particularly for blue staters this year\nSure from a purely tax standpoint I'm oftentimes it comes down to uh do you want to have a private foundation or do you want to open a death\nOr and the reality is a private foundations have significantly lower the tax deduction limits and it didn't than their donor revise fun so for example don't advise fund um can read the tax deduction of sixty percent of aid GI for all cash gifts\nCompared to thirty percent for a private foundation um which is a pretty significant difference especially if you're in the blue states um and have that that need predictability\nYes the duct abilities everything because you advise gets the auctions you do have a line them up and move into a donor advised trust I see that this doesn't require you to be super wealthy or even no high high net worth\nAnd because the average ... account if I read this correctly in an article that you passed on to me it's two hundred and Ninety nine thousand dollars\nUm I Would say it's actually even less than two hundred Ninety nine thousand dollars yet if the minimum contribution for death account ranges from five thousand dollars up to twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd um which is ... and you did not need to maintain that amount to sort of is able to to be able to benefit from that you could open up at five thousand dollars\nAnd spend it all down you can spend it down over the course of several years so I think it's really important to notice the note that the anybody can open Adele revised fun there's a perception sometimes that oh if you are\nA philanthropist that means you're ever Carnegie are tied wealth they have a private foundation and the reality is that the deaths are beautiful way of for democratizing a full after ... across the country\nYes let's press the costs here if I recall correctly to open your own charitable foundation can costs Fifteen thousand dollars initially plus you need lawyers but his lawyers can write to open a staff we can call up last invader and say how do I do this and you make your contribution right away and you're and you and your ...\nThat's exactly right I mean once you find you can find the count with cash security property and as soon as that account is funded you are ready to go and most to in our case you could open up an account as a matter of minutes not an account not a matter of days and months and no legal fees at all and then the minimum ... distribution is relatively low\nYes it's five percent for charitable foundation what is it for DAS\nRight five percent of the ... foundation refers to you are legally obligated to to contribute five percent of your core at an annual year a there is no such limit on a donor vice fund so you ah can decide to grant all of the money in your account out in a given year you can opt to grab none of it out in a given year\nWhat a donor advised fun allow ours is for the donor that would be the boomer to direct how that money to be used in perpetuity how does that how does that part work loss\nYeah we're getting to the idea of donor intent um and donor intent I think it was an extraordinarily important concept um because the truth of the matter is a wealth is not actually pass on very well to the next generation and and speaking with those in your audience who are in the sort of boomer and even pre bloom or\nThey may be interested to know that takes the average inherited Nineteen days to buy a new car\nUm and uh a lot of wealth has gone by the end of the second generation or from Europe standpoint if you've got a legacy you're interested in um a donor advise fun is particularly important and I would argue for those who are of conservative minds that this\nIs extremely important because unfortunately in our history the bulk of those private foundations that came from the Carnegie and the Rockefeller's the forwards out of a great capitalistic tradition now actively fund organizations that undermined those and so a place like donors trust\nSays to those individuals we care about your legacy we will ensure that your grants or our grants that your recommendation will only go to organizations that essentially promote ideas of free enterprise person responsibility limited government and that's a very very important idea when thinking about the next generation\nDon't advise sons didn't much exist in the ... century and you've been in business since the late twenties\nCentury now into the twenty first what's changed as the ... is Congress more friendly is the administration have people change their opinions why don't advise funds are attractive\n[noise] I think that the the simplest ... a reason is exactly the word I just use simple I'm desperate created originally by community foundations and many Jewish foundations actually a long time ago who are particularly concerned about keeping funds in and among the Jewish community and Jewish causes\nAnd so they actually came up with a philanthropic idea of a death\nWe have seen the growth of the last Twenty years twenty five years of death because there are simple and they are cheap and they're inexpensive and they protect intent and they're very effective at promoting and protecting privacy I think in the last Fifteen Twenty years as we watched the politics of civility decline a bit\nThe idea donor privacy has been at the impetus for the growth of a lot of death\nThe commercial donor by sense of grown for the simple reason that people had all of their stocks and finances in one place and they saw this as an opportunity to make some money and take advantage of it truth be told the largest charity in the United states is now the deputy which the daughter of Iceland\nAnd finally don't advise funds are a small piece of philanthropy\nUh the large piece I Believe the number is over eight hundred billion dollars is in private foundations but what I see is the growth for gas is exceeding that for private foundations is this a story that spreading or is it just me\nNo this is a story that's starting to spread particularly as if they did it come in the last couple of years where the growth has been exponential\nAnd I think in many ways a Congress has probably made it that focus so much on foundation\nAnd and made it so complicated and put a new regulations that what happens to Capitol find other ways of being Flintstone tropic and generous and guess what out of that come deaths\nThey're growing significantly I see no reason why they won't continue to grow a they're very effective and more importantly they're actually putting more money out into the nonprofit world than foundations are and I think at the end of the day that's a that's reflected deciding which we live\nMoney goes where it's treated best loss in ... president and CEO of donors trust that donors trust dot org I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nThis segment of the

election\nBut it's become now and one reason these articles in the New York times the Washington Post the New Yorker\nBack it appears according to the stories that Russia's actually put Trump in the White House so since we began talking about is two and a half years ago the the the the narrative of what's called Russia gate has really become very dramatic\nFor many publications Trump sits in the White House because of ... in the criminal and now as you say\nThe narrative continues with the circle to sort of certainty that the Russians will do everything possible and possibly succeed in keeping the Democrats from taking control of the house of representatives so that\nThe Russians couldn't protect Trump and people therefore come up to me and say you know do you think the Russians will be able to throw the election to the Republicans it's unbelievable\nWant to answer that Steve by pointing to the old Cold War I've been reading you know I Do that a deal about Russia and our in our book the spy on the trader\nWithin back mcentire this is the greatest that's been a story of the Cold War it's about a man\nWho was deep into the cage you be the son of the cage you be and he flipped to the am I fix some time in the Nineteen eighties and became the critical source for information of eh my six they didn't share it with the CIA his name was ...\nHe is now forever living ... anonymously in Great Britain under a sentence of death from the old kid you'd be no FSB but the reason I mentioned him\nIs that in Nineteen eighty three Margaret Thatcher was facing a critical reelection\nShe was working a hand in glove with Ronald Reagan fighting the old Cold War\nAnd her opposite number in parliament was a very prominent labor politician named Michael Foot\nWho was leading labor to challenge\nA Margaret Thatcher what I learned from the new book by Ben mcentire is that Michael Foot was an agent of the cage you beat they paid him for information for many years he was a KGB accept as a labor leader\nHowever the twist here is they didn't tell Margaret Thatcher that's right she went to the people and she won that race a dominant lay Thirteen million votes to eight million for a foot labor party and seven million for the liberals\nShe won that without making that allegation they thought it best that they not trouble her because it would complicate the situation with ... it would complicate the old Cold War now\nSteve I presented as as an example of interference [laughter] democracy but the interference by our side we decide we're going to interfere by not telling the leader of the British Parliament\nAnd in a close ally of Ronald Reagan that she's being challenged by the KGB we didn't tell her and here we are in twenty I mean there's forest here are we what we need is a what we need is a Broadway burlesque to ... to show this\nWhat we have in twenty sixteen is an allegation were all they do is tell Donald Trump all they do is tell Mrs Clinton she tells Donald Trump details Hillary Clinton\nAnd there's no evidence adds up right tonight there's no evidence that anything's real it's completely made up there's the irony of the old Cold War versus the new Cold War when it really mattered they kept mum when it doesn't matter they chatter away\nWhat struck me I didn't know the story about Michael for it but I remember him very well as the leader of the Labour Party at that time\nWhat strikes me is is that they\nThey knew about sport as a fact\nYeah and they kept they kept it from the political leadership yes in the case of Trump it was all whispers in shadow was no evidence has ever been produced\nTwo and a half years later that the Kremlin had any old compromise or or anything on Trump and yet whoever started this story I think we know what started in the CIA I Believe it did with Brennan\nSo it was the intelligence agencies\nYou're right the first thing they did was grab it as much as they could because I thought it would damage Trump's campaign and you're also right that Mrs Clinton actually said in the debate I think it was August the third debate\nIn two thousand sixteen she actually several debate the Trump was a a puppet of the Kremlin which is essentially an agent and there were such articles in the New York times by so called retired CIA agents literally accusing Trump\nOf being recruited agent of equipment so the reaction was completely different\nUh ... was a factor I guess in that case it was kept a secret what was something made up I think about Trump was Blair it everywhere they could get a TV camera on them or a newspaper to print it so I don't know if this is a sign of different times or of different kinds of\nPeople who have what I learned from this isn't it a democracy people believe the conspiracy of the moment if they want to there are still people in the United kingdom ... told me that's when we talked about his book\nAnd because he revealed that fact again it was not unknown but he ... he emphasized that again there are still members of labor party who denied this quote who say it's not true which made opposite if some tore plot\nSo more than Thirty years later so thirty five years from now we'll turn to what damage this is doing to us and speculate a little bit\nUh next I'm speaking with professor call and we're having too much fun of course because history is filled

midterm elections the story that the Russians are interfering undermining de legitimizing wrecking American democracy\nOn line that's how they're doing it no one is actually saying they're sleeper agents coming awake\nAnd charging ... the voting booth in critical districts across the country in order to swing vote to swing vote to the Republicans do the whole point here is that the Republicans are having the vote swaying away from them to the Democrats so I guess the charge\nThe the sleeper agents are not going to show up in the critical suburbs where the battle really is they're sixty six of them across the country\nNancy Pelosi had very best is said to win thirty nine of those Republican seats to take the majority by the allegation is that the Russians have magic online to do this\nAnd even I are looking at what damage we've done to ourselves by believing this because nothing comparable have it in the first Cold War professor I interrupted you 'cause we've got too excited about these Russian troll farms that I was like I don't really laugh at them I thought it was sweet the way they tried to participate but they couldn't quite mask the fact\nThat it was morning time in Petersburg and that's why they were suddenly on line in my Twitter feed\nIt was probably eight hours later and St Petersburg than it was here oh no I was in the middle of the night to remember the hours I keep well\nBut I say that's why it was already working day morning in Moscow right I mean at three AM in New York my Russian front it's eleven AM in\nLauderdale right on and I would see them on to her and I would see them after I got off work and all of a sudden they'd be there between two and four AM\nIs their workday writers are spread out like uh there's something else here and I mean this is not entirely generational I think every listener will have some memory of this the second allegation being made and I mean this appears in the new\nYork Times we're not talking about you know crock pot and goes out to publish somewhere or give me in a rural village in Arkansas we're talking about the New York times in the Washington Post which claimed to be the greatest newspapers in the world certainly in America we\nGet this narrative that what the Russians did by way of trial in addition to trying to um put Trump in the White House and I quote exactly I'm reading right from the front page of the New York times October twenty is just so quote\nDiscord and division and America\nSo what the Russians were up to was dividing us\nMaking us have profound political and social and racial and ethnic disagreements um and thereby it goes on to say undermine our democracy so I remember a long life and I can't remember\nAny time on my boys one\nIn the Jim Crow south in Kentucky [noise] through my young adulthood in Indiana and eventually in New York and then in the northeast where I knew ever sense\nAn era in my life when this country wasn't in the throes of pretty deep

there we can go on to Watergate we can go on to to ... to the Iraq War\nSo division and discord\nHas been part of American Life all my life the idea that the Russians created it\nJust seems preposterous to me and yet it's taken with great seriousness I expect very soon and you may think this seems so dynamically skeptical and cynical but some argument that ... will somehow created you know racial injustice and the United states that maybe he was linked\nTo American slavery or something because it has gotten completely out of control\nWell the the loser blame let me give you an example I don't mean to interrupt you know know what they're called ... or\nIs this this wouldn't be pipe bomb or a bomber I forget his name\nThe allegation against the Florida resident yes\n... let's find a link him to Russia now there's an article in the Washington Post and the reason I cite the articles and I don't want your your listeners to think I make this stuff up\nObama likes to say he just made stuff up but I didn't make this stuff up in the Washington Post on October twenty eight what's today the thirtieth two days ago the headline reads pipe bomb suspect posted about Russians\nAnd when I read the article it turns out that he was posting Russia propaganda let me just\nTell you what the propaganda is because it's important that they cite the guy posted something which is the Washington Post things she got from Russia saying that Russia and the Syrian Government or fighting terrorists than Sarah so let me repeat\nThat that the pipe bomber posted something nobody knows where he died\nUh it wasn't a Russian sourcing posted on his website or our social media an article that said that the Russian Army in Syria and the Syrian Government headed by President Assad are fighting terrorists and the post goes on to\nSay that this isn't true because it says Washington for years has said that these people and I quote we're not terrorists but a legitimate uprising against the authoritarian government of a shot well there's two\nDifferent versions of the war in Syria personally\nI Am here to the version that the pipe bomb proposed that but I didn't get

the Russians for having weaken the Tories are strengthened labor I'm not sure what the interpretation is\nAnybody losing an election on the planet earth these days can blame Russia\nCouldn't get it so live Ukraine aside for a moment because they're one understands what's going on I mean this really is a very intimate Ukrainian Russian affair and they are gone abysmally\nSocial media each other but what's gone or the way those issues arisen the Russian role alleged and British elections is because prime minister may has a catastrophic problem with the exit from the European Union with a referendum bright\nBright Perot mayors are winning\nShe either gets in the ... an agreement that's acceptable boat to the European Union and to her own party the Tory party or she's gone that's just the bottom line now and the party elders don't like they can win an election with her at the head of the tech so her fate\nHas to do with solving this breakfast problem so what's the reason is is the idea there should be a second referendum you probably heard about yes\nThe problem with this this is this is the most undemocratic thing in the world I mean it would be like saying we have election for president United States where we don't like the outcome let's have a redo\nI mean it it can't have a democracy if elections and referendum is our pure form of election it's a one issue democratic float some people think they are bad but nobody denies it for maybe centuries but certainly decades\nAnd many countries they have been just icing legitimate ways of resolving profound problems you would agree with that yeah we don't we don't do it very often states do it on bond issues and things like California loves to do it\nKind of like one but I don't know how many national referendum we've ever had if any salt and some democratic there's thinker by some things are good but they are what they are they're they're they're pure democracy\nHumans have we have two minutes go ahead\nSo that people are Great Britain voted to leave the European Union now people are calling for another referendum that is the people against breakfast and what are they arguing there now arguing that the Kremlin intervene in the\nFirst rough around and therefore it should be done to get there is not a shred of evidence for this not a shroud bodies become as you say John who did it it's become a political talking point for those Tories in England who won a second referendum they they're not going to get it even that they were proposed\nIs undemocratic what\nIs the default position the election doesn't count because ... intervened now we can't go on his democracies that's my point\nIf we can't trust our electoral process we can't trust our borders\nTherefore ... plants and all they trust the leadership bright state actually the\n... and we can't trust therefore the representatives institutions that they present the the the the presidency and the Congress so where's is headed John\nUh I I I Want to I Want to uh west solid answer here where it's headed is that democracy itself is being damaged democracy itself is being damaged by the doubters\nAnd yeah this is the ironic point on which I Would like to end the accusation against the Kremlin is they are trying to damage our democracy and my answer is no we're doing it ourselves\nAs the one more detail here about democracy and the mid term they're very difficult to interpret I mean Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker of the house is what ...\nWell science says happens after a close election in which the party out of power then challenges the party in power so that will not prove anything the only way for the Kremlin to show it strength next week\nIs for the Republicans to hold the house I guess I guess that's it it's one of those things where you throw the you where you further which in the water and if if the which drown it wasn't a which if it floats that was a which is that it\nWell we do one thing that's interesting is that\nTo the extent that Gallup polling and other polling tells us what people think we notice fifty seven percent of people want a better relationship with Russia that's pretty good

vigil at the central synagogue following the deadly shooting in Pittsburgh where the first funerals were held\nEnormously successful far exceeded the expectations nine years later and I guarantee any optical telescopes it gets launched into space is going to do exactly that guarantees and the data is still being analyzed there's ... there has decade decades of\nPHD theses a head of is a two and congratulations to Kepler and everybody who hands but now Hubble Bob's own humble he is the author of universe and I'm here and there were some doubt humble moved into safe mode what's happened Bob\nWells after three weeks of trouble shooting this ... this past weekend they successfully I'm sure I got the backup a gyroscope operating so that Hubble now works on three tries scopes which means you can continue to is that three dimensional control which means that can\nPoint very precisely and accurately and take the typically great images it always does everyone have to understand that this sets your situation is now very temporary Hubble no longer has any backup driver scopes as three gyroscope no backups if another fails what's going to happen then is it going to go to one gyroscope mode\nWhich will allow them to do some science but of a limited nature kind of like capital is doing its later days and they'll hold a second working ... hours go back a as a backup\nNot so much to extend the life of the telescope as much as making sure that telescope can be controlled and pointed and placed in a in a correct orientation because at some point\nUm they're gonna have to um either de orbit or raise it to all of it because this is big enough to hit the ground and so at some point late in the next decade Hubble's going to all that's going to start to decay and at that point they have to be able to attach a robot\nOr or engine to it to de orbited or to raise this all day in order to do that they've got to have it under some kind of control and that means I going to need at least one gyroscope functioning and so where in the limited life Hubble right\nNow the next gyroscope that goes it's going to be on its way out this is a tragic thing and we\nDo not have a replacement for Hubble unfortunately none at all I mean I had a lot of interesting comments on my website about suggestion a robot mission even a manned mission to\nFix the driver scopes of replacing the Hubble and actually one of those ideas as possible we have the technology to rub a robot mission to do this now they were looking at it a decade ago it was too soon now the technology and software exist to do a robot mission to replace those gyros\nYou could also do a possibly a manned mission using their dragon capsule and a sickness I'm\nA cargo Marshall together or to bring up a quick meant and a docking part and then maybe even a quickly made a robot arm to grapple Hubble and maybe do this by mad\nThat would be more ambitious I think but either way this is something that NASA should look into there's no reason\nWhy it was ... die Bob\nCould could we moved to a place where not to sell ... to a private enterprise that can fix it and then monetize\nThat's an interesting idea that would be that that's another option that would require a the Trump Administration uh taking a very different approach they haven't yet that that would understand the concepts of private enterprise more than I think the Trump Administration and NASA\nOn a ... there for perpetuity we can't remove the possibility that a future government would understand that monetize ... which is a miracle machine is good for the federal government and good for ...\nYeah absolutely right I personally think that a private company may be safe sex maybe Lon mosque should say hey I'll save this telescope to the public relations purposes and they could with something right Heather and make it happen and I really think that would be a good thing I said this\nSince I wrote universe in the mirror this is a telescope that will not die every decade someone's come along to try to kill it and every decade the want to try to kill it ends up become becoming a booster for the telescope and where to situation now where are we going to start facing the orbiting telescope and I think\nWhen that happens they are going to say well why do you why do we just said the robot up to fix it right that's where we're coming\nOut of curiosity again we had we had moments of anxiety about curiosity because he had a main computer and its backup computer\nOr ... or behaving unusually but Bob says things are restored Bob back a little better than ever\nThat you know I wouldn't say better than ever ... this is breaking news that no one else has covered yet the essence sent out a press release and most modern journalists today wait for the press release but I track\nThe actual images and the stuff coming from the science community\nAnd the science team has made it clear at that blog that they're in the process this week of resuming soulful science operations and if you look at the wrong image is I had links to both by the way\nOn behind the black you can see that in the last week they started to send out lots of images from multiple cameras every day that's something they haven't done six weeks so it's very clear that they've got the computers um\nIn a in a working in a manner that they're satisfied in that proceeding to download data again um they have not yet released detailed description outlying why it took so long to get the second computer up and running and what a what they're doing\nIf anything to repay the computer that produce the problems themselves last month it would be really good if they could get the secondary computer I'm working again so that they have a backup because both of these computers had problems over the life of the mission now and\nThen the on the computers of the rovers got so we'd love to have both of them in a good shape so we'll have to wait for that press release it hasn't come out\nAnd they're going back to drilling Bob is that what what have\nWe I'm not sure what they're going to do next I mean the average will plan was not to drill at this location but to stop moving out off of air Ruben region up the mountain but one of the things they discovered on getting new images\nAre at the psych they've been sitting there for so long which was a drill site by the way is that all the dust that had been scaring the ground in the interim blow away\nI'm not sure why this was this all occurred after the sense that the storm it occurred so it wasn't wasn't specifically that dust on that but it was wins and some of the ground is clear\nAll the all the dust from the drill hole also blow away so they're looking at the ground again and say listen this so we don't know what they're going to do next to the long term plan is clearly up up the mountain and that's not too far a few\nTime looking at the front has cam and what you see is recognizable um earth plot a landscape here Bob it looks like there's sand in very small grains a rock\nIn between larger boulders or larger rocks that are peaking through so that's the dust that you say blow away to reveal these uh these these folders\nYeah Avi Rubin rejects you'll remember John and it's shown it and many images since I got up to the top is kind of like\nUm [noise] it's a plateau that uh has like these flat boulders everywhere cracked with space dust in between so you're driving over almost like a a an uneven rock pavement flat rock pavement\nAnd so the bus blows away and you could see those rocks better and those rocks have been very hard they have not been able to stuff to drill through any of them very well and they really would like to get a drill off the top of the rich but they haven't found one that can do it yet so we'll just have to see how it goes next year\nBoy does that look like the bottom of something and had water on it could also be wind erosion I understand All right we go to park what is Parker about\nOh I felt a parka the park or sell the probe is on its way into an orbit of the sun or it's going to orbit the sun multiple times over the next decade um cut get very close to the sun to observe the sun well it was only last the summer\nIt has now set this week has set new to new space records the first it's and it's now gotten close to the sun than any other spacecraft ever has\nIts within twenty six million miles the sun's surface which requires a lot of protection for heat because even a twenty six million miles it get cooked and the second thing is this week it is now ... is now moving the fastest of any space craft we've ever launched now traveling\nAt a hundred and fifty three thousand two hundred and fifty three thousand miles per hour or more than that that was the previous record set in Seventy six by he Leo's too which is another cell the probe these are only just begun because it's every orbit is going to get closer to the sun as it flies in and every all it will mean it'll be going faster\nAs it flies in past ... so this is going to go over the next decade Jon lots of interesting things to be learned as a\nSob

investigative reporting in the race for governor shift in Florida posing Ron descent\nAs Congressman Ron descent as against mayor Andrew Gillum are in a very good evening to you I read in your most recent report at Breitbart that Andrew Gillum has an unusual background in preparation to be a political speaker\nUh he has worked and continued to work until twenty Seventeen with an organization that is identified the problem with the United states the last two hundred and forty years apparently it's predatory capitalism and Christian Gemini what the heck is he talking about good evening to our\nGood evening yeah this is actually a really significant story because until now\nUm there's been another group with which he has been associated and you and I have talked about it repeatedly is called dream defenders right which is there an anti Israel\nAnti patriotic anti police and military organization um and I reported on Gillum close association with dreams defenders how he signed a radical pledge that are called for the about Schmidt of the police\nUm and how he's written in support of this group how he hated their activism\nAnd he's been asked numerous times publicly by one does sound just the latest was actually in an interview with me twenty four hours ago um but many times including the debate Gillum has been asked to disavow this group and we've all been wondering why hasn't done so\nSo now and I can't believe I only found this in the last forty eight hours because I've been investigating Gillum for quite some time but it turns out that deal I'm for openly from two thousand and two until last year when he announced he was about to announce his run for governor in Florida\nHe was the director of a youth organization that first of all radical training youth organization that train dream defenders train be founders of dream defenders first of all they graduated from his training organization so that's ... first why apparently he's not this value them\nBut that we were like we took a closer look at this group I'm it's at the ... finance people for the American way um and he he served as he served as youth director\nUm your leadership program to recruit from two thousand five to two thousand a cemetery where oversaw aid organization called the young people for white the four and when I say he oversaw I mean while he was mayor of Tallahassee\nHe was paid by people for American away as they paid their actor and he was very hands on a we look at the website and his bio and its picture is right there at the top\nOf the staff directory and we find announcements where he did hires army headlined fundraisers so he's working basically part time for this group blog is the mayor of ... and it turns out this group and we went through the archives of its their website well Gillum was there it\nHas radical or more radical as grim defenders I I look at the rhetoric here and I'm quoting here\nUm their mission is quote the challenge us predatory capitalism they went to abolish the prison system just like dream defenders they want to fight quote a spiritual resistance against a Christian ... they want to read the fine the American borders\nUm collective liberation him um they accuse us of being a quote colonialists power on purpose or perpetrating quote structural violence and continued genocide um they claimed the U.S judicial system as quote justify a white supremacist policing practices\nAnd I can go on this is the highlights so it really this rhetoric mirrors the group that he has been trying to distance himself from\nDream to factor is only now Gillum was in charge of this group is was his organization and I think we are just scratching the surface of of his radicalism\nI'm reading from the statements from I guess their website right this is a these statements of their mission it's breathtakingly try at the same time it suggests that he is\nHe is against what he's now running for which is the constitution of the United states and the state of Florida it's peculiar has he come out in any fashion and explain how he's done a ... one eighty in order to be the governor of Florida if he is\nWell not yet this is just came out but I saw dream defenders actually retweeted at so thank you dream defenders for that um and by the way I'm going to be in Miami's shortly where I'm going to try and go I interviewed dream defender let's see how that goes but ... it's not just with this Gillum\nHas claimed that nobody paid for any of his trips he says he doesn't need it and we're finding actually people for the American away this group sent him to New York on the very weekend where he is strangely obtain that Hamilton ticket a two thousand and six team\nThat's been a part of the debate puzzle right that he wouldn't ... that he Gillum is not offered an adequate explanation for his funding\nEven while the trip had two undercover FBI agents and that they took it originated with them but but he was saying you know nobody pays for his wife well this group pay for his way\nTheir statements about um the undercover agent and I'm a ... a a lobbyist from Florida who actually got a to point one million dollar contract from Columbus city\nAre and who pays for different trips here and there um so he he's kind of trying to have it both ways but he also he claims he didn't say certain things that he said um he he talks about not having Medicare for all he actually he said it we'd we've documented that he changed a lot of his rhetoric\nIt would ... in order to run for president so sorry for for governor and this kind of reminds me of rock Obama where\nHe and the early days of his career was so associated with anti American radicals anti Israel radicals and then run for president on on suddenly a centrist platform and it's the same here with Gillum\nHe's made statements against moving the embassy of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem eyes rated very strange statements about the Gaza Strip and claims that Israel was using rocketing from Gaza to justify attacks against the Palestinians\nAre and now we finally he go I'm training and the founder of dreamed offenders which boycott Israel and he's claiming on the other hand that he doesn't support the boycott of Israel and that he's pro Israel\nTo make sure your trip seem less hotel minor dot com is sure to get you the best rain during the busy holiday
