Jarrett I Am sure remember him he had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody I Know but I'm just saying you know just in case you don't want to remind you so Jared and had a quadruple

someone up there I gave him a second chance on life he\nWent and it completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this triple bypassing all these other things and\nSo he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um\nYou know a piece heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he gets decided his girlfriend I think finally told him that you know you kind of either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago and and so he came in and\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals\nAnd snacks and take out ... you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever and and um\nYou know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things he used to do accounting ... anyway lo and behold a forty days later\nUh forty nine pounds wow [noise] and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain are we are no longer getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he\nIs my favorite part he gets to spend more money and buying clothes and buying clothes first girlfriend it presents for her so you know it's like [laughter]\nIt's always my favorite part I shopping is key to this whole thing and you know he ... and the best part is is that he no longer depressed because he actually started to feel so much better once the weight started to come off that he realized\nThat his life wasn't over you know the heart was sixteen out the bypass worked eight years ago so you know here we go it's like a second chance in life so he really is thankful he cooks now um you know he says I Can't believe how much money I'm saving by not\nEating out every meal and\nYou know like you're getting it sounds like somebody who's sponsoring like a

[laughter]\nIn Pittsburgh thousands of people gathered at an interfaith service to honor the victims of Saturday's mass killing of the tree of life synagogue and to speak out against anti Semitism including Israel's minister of education and diaspora affairs Naftali Bennett nearly eighty years\nAnd it starts to produce so much insulin through this um that that's encouraged by the visceral fat that your cells don't respond as well to the insulin\nAnd so because they don't respond as well to the insulin the message doesn't get deliver that the insulin is trying to tell the cell doesn't get delivered as well the cell or there's insulin resistance and the body makes more insulin and when that happens\nThe there is increased visceral a fat that uh forums because there's ... because they since the resistance happens\nSo here's that cycle okay and it's not a very pretty cycle it's actually a vicious cycle so you have increased visceral fat and that leads to insulin resistance when you have this little resistance that leads to increased insulin and the increased insulin\nTo more stored fat which means further increased insulin resistance so er and further fat so it's really you want you don't want to get into this cycle\nAnd uh it's a very bad cycle to be in so I don't get to teach you a and tell you how to avoid this how to prevent this cycle from developing and I'm also going to tell you what to do\nOnce that cycle starts how you can break it up so this is going to be a great show for you if you're dealing with these issues or you want to avoid dealing with these issues so again this is Dr Warren sleigh ten\nI'm at the regenerative healing ... center right in the heart of Ridgewood New Jersey right now I'm at the top of Madison Square garden live at the WABC studio here so you can reach me live at the studio at eight hundred a for eight WABC eight hundred a for a night to to to\nOr you can call me after the show at my office in Ridgewood at two o one a day to Fifteen hundred two oh one a day to Fifteen hundred or you can\nReach me check my website out and Jay hormones dot com and Jay hormones dot com and definitely check out my YouTube channel ah where you'll learn some things right now I have some shows about furloughs therapy there and that's a that's on the general feeling show and that's going to be a the the ah\nThe YouTube channel is a little over a month old I'm adding a show a week so hopefully you'll start to see more shows and uh\nI enjoy them so again uh we were we today we're talking about visceral fat inflammation\nAnd insulin resistance and that we're going to talk about what to do about this so now you have again we're let's let's take it back to where we're up to ... wearing this vicious cycle of increase fat especially visceral fat increased inflammation and increased insulin resistance the increase\nStill the resistance leads to further increased insulin which leads to further increase fat and it's ... you got to break the cycle or your health is in grave danger\nAnd so one of the ways that we are going to do that and we're going to talk about a great way to start a to break up this cycle is with hormones so\nThe a great thing about hormones is that many of their hormones and I I Love to use by identical hormones and I'm going to get more specific about which hormones and just a moment the ... or many of the hormones eat away at the visceral fat okay\nAnd so that's a great way to start breaking up this cycle and once the visceral fat\nOr starts to decrease the insulin resistance starts to decrease and you start reversing this terrible cycle\nSo for men okay and here's another part of the vicious cycle that that is interesting when you get when you have increased visceral fat okay the or your testosterone levels start to decrease so the fast growing up and\nThe testosterone is going down so again here's another aspect of that vicious cycle that works against you so the decreased testosterone unfortunately also leads to increased fat\nOkay and that's because ... thrown itself has a role in decreasing the fat\nIt improves metabolism and they're metabolized says that fat it converts that fat to muscle so by converting that fat to muscle you are able to break up the cycle of um\n... by a turn that fat the muscle you're able to start to break up that cycle so how do you break the cycle you give testosterone\nSo when your testosterone levels going lo and then you give testosterone you start to reverse the cycle and that's what you want to do you want to reverse this vicious cycle\nAnd you reverse the cycle by taking that visceral fat turning it into muscle and once you have to do the decrease fat your body will uh be more likely to make testosterone and you'll and that insulin resistance will start to decrease the information will start to decrease\nAnd you're going to start to get much healthier and the other thing that happens also we have a ... a giving testosterone is\nYour low when you're lowering your risk of a lot of the diseases I've been talking about so you lower your risk of heart disease because there's less risk row fat less inflammation so less likelihood of class forming\nOkay so that's real important now another a big concern about a lot when I mentioned to a lot of my male patients about starting testosterone is what about prostate cancer well everyone associates testosterone with prostate cancer\nUm because uh ... uh the testosterone is kind of the male hormone in the prostate is the the gland that just men have\nBut what's very interesting is that men who take testosterone who have higher testosterone levels have\nA generally have lower Gleason score is if they are diagnosed with prostate cancer Gleason scores are the index of how severe the prostate cancer is\nAnd the higher the Gleason score the more um severe the prostate cancer and the the worst the prognosis so those with low testosterone levels\nHad increased a brief higher Gleason scores which means that the prostate cancer that did a show up was a more severe those with higher testosterone levels had lower Gleason scores\nAnd why would that be well you're lowering the inflammation so you're lowering the um you're making the environment or less favorable for cancer development\nBy lowering that information and testosterone helps lower than information so to that so that's that's thrown does not cause prostate cancer giving testosterone does not\nSo that's been shown in multiple multiple studies\nAnd a break um reducing your risk for prostate cancer or at least more severe prostate cancer can be achieved with his asked her own\nReplacement because your testosterone levels will be higher so a odds are if you get a testosterone cancer you're more likely to have a lower Gleason score with a higher testosterone level\nSo now let's talk about for women\nWhat's a good way for women to eat away at this this real fat well for women especially once they've reached mental pause\nThey have lost their estrogen and projects thrown production\nAnd by because they've lost their estrogen and protest stone production they ... they get increased visceral fat and had it how is this manifests well during menopause women gain on average about ten to Fifteen pounds\nAnd I can assure you that they are not gaining muscle they're gaining fat and more important they're gaining a lot of visceral fat so uh and again visceral fat is the very ... very dangerous kind of fat for their health\nAnd that's why a lot of women tell me or they get ... they've had different medical problems that developed ... at the onset of menopause\nSo heart disease increases dramatically or for women around ... and ... and soon after and all are all kinds of inflammatory diseases even thyroid disease in a increases around the time ... what's the common denominator they're getting\nA they're losing the ash region and protests around and they're getting increased fat and increased inflammation and this increase inflation leads to these kinds of diseases\nSo there are a lot more in that there are ... at a lot more increased risk for heart disease\nOnce they once women are once they lose their estrogen and ... and the way to prevent that and the way to reduce that fat is by taking 'em by replacing estrogen and protests around\nAnd it's a very safe thing to do and a very healthy thing to do because it reduces the risk of heart disease it reduces even your risk of Alzheimer's and it reduces or your risk of osteoporosis so again this is Dr Warren ... ten\nI met the regenerative healing center right at the heart of Ridgewood New Jersey right now I'm at the WABC studio so you can reach me at eight hundred a for eight WABC eight

make sure you're still addressed sharply because first impressions last\nAnd you never know what opportunity will be there when when wherever you are in fact I always tell people make sure to have your business cards on you in fact how important is it is it like\nYou know and like you wouldn't leave home without your pants right\nDon't leave home without your business cards even in today's day and age I mean it's actually a good idea to have an impressive as business card help people that stop me and asked me for mine [laughter] I have quite an impressive business and it's quite expensive but it's worth it because once I have that interaction with the person I Want it to be memorable right\nSo therefore make sure to have your business cards on you all the time here's another thing about that a salesman is a full time performer you have to always be on time if you have a meeting you have to show up on time\nNow what happens this question comes up what happens if you're you made every effort to come on time and you just the you know you you gave yourself extra time you're not looking for excuses but\nIt happens and you show up like the best thing you could do is of course first of all I had a schedule lead the party know that you're running Late Show them that courtesy and then when you show up\nMake a point of it to say I'm Sorry say listen\nI made an effort to be on time I Know how important it is to be on time I'm almost always on time\nThere were circumstances beyond my control that the lead me from getting here I Am sorry and let's hit the ground running that's the way to handle it now of course again you should always be on time and always allowed that buffer time in order to allow yourself to ensure that will be on time\nBut that is also another and we have that down as rule number two to be successful and say oh let's go to rule number three\nAlways be clear and articulate\nWhether it's you're leaving a voice mail if you're leaving a voicemail don't mumble the message don't mobile your phone number leave your phone number at the end of the message I mean how many times people leave a voice mail and say Hi this is so and so thank you so much we get back to me they don't leave the number\nSo okay so you say a cane today's day and age everyone has a sea MS ah on their on their phone but let's say you don't have that number for whatever reason you're traveling you're not by your desk you're calling him remotely leave the phone number so that people know how to get back you also if you're leaving a email address is an important tip\nSpell it out clearly and spell it out really clearly unexplained the difference of let's say people easily can get mixed up between AT T and if the state tea for Tom ... for Peter bell and explain it\nOver communicate in fact there was a good post recently by Gary ... talked about and he said a word that I always use a favorite word your bottom line over communicate\nThe importance of over communication always be clear and articulate\nOkay let's move along to number four set goals now each of the Seventeen principles is really an entire subject by itself but let's see uh you know spend a minute on this one went up\nEspecially in the world of sales set the goals slightly above what you can realistically expect to hit not lower okay not lower but certainly not but also not much higher\nBecause if you do that then it's out of reach and then a person could give up writes like by losing weight right you have to make incremental steps you try to I'm gonna lose fifty pounds a one week you know it doesn't happen\nBut if you say I'm going to lose one pound and or two pounds\nAnd you approach it that way and you do it's slowly but surely ... certainly after a half a year you could knock off thirty forty fifty pounds shout out there to ... last go to shed a couple of pounds they're nice job there [laughter]\nHey you spread the word I think I could say it on the air anyways next about I mean keeping on number four here about goals be focused on the goals and set incremental goals\nNot just manually monthly as well it's also good idea to share the goals in fact I Want to it now want to talk about how sales and marketing work hand in hand\nYou can share your goals and leverage them to your advantage in the business setting so for example car dealerships right so car dealerships a certain goals and therefore let's say they have to then move certain product right they still have\nSeventy five cars and a lot and they need to get in the new the new models that are coming in so they will say to the to the crowd I said listen we have to have a a clearance here we have to ah we have certain goals and therefore you know we'll ... we'll entertain any reasonable offer\nWhen you do that you're leveraging your goals to your advantage and in many cases that works that works well let's move to number five [noise]\nBecome a great listener clients love people who listen and I mean really listen and know that when they talk they are being hurt okay\nSo I'm going to share a little story here about an account they landed a couple of years ago never forget it\nWe were in the room and it was a serious meeting was a you know kind of the deciding meeting to land bottom line marketing group to service and account\nAnd meeting went for a while if I recall correctly was close to three hours really long meeting and at the end of the meeting so the um the person will call him Andy\nAndy says to me he says it took 'em you must not be a busy guy said OK and be like ... ... ... um why do you say that he said because during the entire meeting you didn't go to your phone phones and Rene you didn't\nAnd go to it like you know contacting you like what's going on\nI said Andy uh I mean\nI I Can't show you the phone because it's confidential maybe how many but you want me to count how many emails came over the last three hours\nIt's just that have a policy if I'm meeting with someone I'm a listener I'm concentrating exclusively on that person at the meeting so therefore I didn't pull out my phone but their messages there of course\nHe said look you've got the account I got it because it was a great listener and he saw the entire time I was concentrating on him that's why even by my desk\nI have my phone my cell actually you ignore most of the day because otherwise the distractions are just too much when you're with someone give them your complete concentration\nEvery client loves that an deserves that we're going to move to number six but before we do we're going to take a short commercial break your two to Seventy seven WABC the mind your business show we'll be right back stay tuned\nHey Joe give me a minute [noise] I'm going to run the numbers on

Y. B. radio dot com M. Y. B. radio dot com number twelve\nA salesperson always has to act with politeness and even a touch of humility now of course you have to be assertive but polite and humble let me explain [noise]\nIf you work at let's say a desk job you have you know you have a you have a boss right so therefore right you're respectful to that individual okay right never bite the hand that feeds\nA sales person has to realize that every single client is their boss right you're a salesperson your clients are your bosses\nIn fact I you know something happened or the other day I was just shocked there was someone that called me that wanted wanted they wanted to become a vendor a bottom line marketing group and what was the person doing he was barking into a speaker phone now\nThere are times that a speaker phone you know ... maybe use I my policy is I Do not talking to a speaker phone unless I have a specific reason and I'll identify that to the client\nOr to defend or whatever it is I'll say there are few people in the room or I'm taking notes and I didn't have my headset whatever the case is and that will be a case when I may use a speaker phone but in general I don't talk to people on speaker phone it's not polite\nSo this person is calling me and he wants to my business and he's barking into the phone\nThey said listen you know excuse me you know and you are you on a speaker phone like personal does echo and I can't hear right and you just barking\nSo the person didn't even grasp because there was like yeah what's the problem\nYou know I tried to la hello like it was just you know so let me get some other tips that ah that fit on this topic under this note of number of twelve which is the uh the importance of always acting with humility [noise]\nNever say it's been very hard trying to reach you always had a salesperson that try it and we know sales people need to try and try and try and try and try and try right to get through to a prospect\nAnd then the the salesperson finally got through and said\nYou know it's so hard to reach you is that does that make any sense is that how you're going to try to build\nA relationship with someone the salesperson trying to win over the prospect you don't tell them is ... you're you're you know it's hard to reach you never say oh playing phone tag here you're ... let's not lose sight of this you're trying to win them over you're trying to build a warm relationship\nSo remember you're trying to win the relationship over from someone\nIt never ignore the obvious treat that person with great respect and act with a touch humility there are times you have to be assertive yep that's true\nBut never lose sight of the fact of who's in control of that relationship now we moved to number Thirteen this is a also such an important one ... hers and practice we talked about by the elevator pitch but I Want to discuss this now from a few different vantage points\nWere hers and practice practice your pitch again and again and again\nLet's say you're going somewhere and you're making a a you're going to a prospect you're gonna meet their conference room and you're going to make a PowerPoint presentation\nSo if you're taking it along on your chip double check and make sure you have that on the chip and make sure that you have it even as a separate file you have the original PowerPoint file and you have it as a PDF\nAnd if you're taking on a laptop make sure that a lot of has it and also downloaded onto the laptop a forum plan plan a plan B plans the let's say you're going to use a a a PowerPoint quicker right that forward that that easily a enables you to go back a slide for to slide et cetera\nMake sure that the batteries in there are good batteries you don't want the batteries to go out in the middle I mean how many times as it happened I mean everyone's probably rolling their eyes because if this happens so often it's it's crazy\nWhere there's a presentation and something goes wrong\nAnd but it's something so silly something that they could have resolved beforehand the batteries are out they accidentally brought the wrong file you know what a killer that isn't a presentation when you have to say oh yeah we're going to be on now I [noise] I didn't bring the rights of all let me show you what I have\nRight away when you say that you're destroying your credibility say you know what does that affect this brings to mind one of the great gifts that we had on the program ship hiking I encourage you to go listen to his shows he's is of course the the customer service group\nHe quoted the c._e._o.\nOf a major airlines yawn Carlson and he said that what goes through the mind of a passenger on an airplane\nIf they were moved down to trade table and as it comes down like gives a jerk and like it it it's it's slightly broken what is the passenger thinking guess what they're thinking of the land and get work the same way [laughter]\nIt's such an important point because people don't people don't put those two things together and that's all coming back to this rule number Thirteen were hers and practice if you're making a PowerPoint presentation make sure that you have the rights filed with you makes you have the laptop to make sure the batteries are charged\nDon't just delegated to someone else double triple check it yes be neurotic about it that's my recommendation be neurotic if you're taking the long the brochures to present make sure you have to mint condition copies and your briefcase okay\nAnd even you know I just want to say even someone who's very smooth and has the gift of gab and can go into a meeting and carry it\nMake sure that you have everything prepared with you because so often people show up and they think that they were prepared like oh who took the bushes that are my briefcase why didn't you check before you left the office okay\nAlways make sure to prepare before you had to a meeting or any business encounter and we continue with our list Seventeen proven rules to be successful in sales number fourteen always do a post mortem what is the post mortem well\nThat's an ... an analysis of what took place\nWe hit bottom line always do a post mortem after a campaign we look at the successes of the campaign that challenges what could have been done better um some of the interesting or twists and turns that come along with any type of campaign you can't foresee everything we try our best you can foresee everything\nSo we do a post mortem and we keep notes during the campaign also told just postponed impose you shouldn't just wait till the end of the campaign and scratch your head oh what can we have done better keep a running logged during the campaign of any ideas that came up\nNow what happens is is that at the end as you're looking at that\nWill be extremely helpful before you do the next type of a campaign but let's talk about this from the vantage point of a salesperson okay so let's say you went and you pitched in accounts and let's say unfortunately did not laying the accounts\nThere is always something they could learn from the experience maybe there is\nCertain types of people that are that you encountered that it's just not a good fit for you may be the type of situation didn't work maybe the the way you are pitching the account didn't work\nBut if a person just constantly goes about their work without ever doing a post war without ever analyzing what's going on they're not going to be able to improve themselves because they're not learning from any of the experiences\nEverything in life as a learning experience and therefore take the time out whether it's every day once a week at once a month\nOr after a certain project again especially for people in sales that are looking to lean big ticket items are in the world of sales in terms of landing service\nThere's always a learning experience but make sure to write them down and study them because that will enable you to really perfected as you move forward number Fifteen this is an interesting one dealing with emotions here's an important tip\nWhy are people entering the Powerball it's because they've heard the they hear these stories of the people right the next day and the newspaper this person won the Powerball now he's a multi millionaire um you're not reading the how many you know the millions of stories there's no stories on the front of the the New York times this person after the Powerball and didn't win\nRight you don't think of the person that they don't win because nobody's talking about the person that didn't when you don't think about the person who bought five tickets I'm wasting their money because no one cares about them anymore they're relevant nobody's writing about them when you think a lot or you think winter\nThat's an important to sort of publicizing the winter when you think raffle think winter so people kind of want to cut it off at after 'em by the drawing and they want to stop they want to stop what they're marketing but that's really if you want to continue the raffle at the next year or do it again the some of the most important marketing happens right then\nRight it's also interesting because like a lot of these rifles like the small ended on an on Instagram\nAnd I know this one account got like there's a lot of raffles and they never posted the winners and a lot of people are commenting like I'm knocking on ... I don't even know if they're getting up the price because you're not even saying like oh this person one it's just like um you know giving out a photo shoot\nBut then no one wins right it doesn't feel right exactly so like especially if you want to do it next year into another like spin off you have to make sure to like stress who the winner is and like take pictures with them and show them that they're a real person actually one\nYeah it's good you brought up Instagram because that can be found to be such a powerful player now in raffles\nUm because instrument makes it silver label and so festival makes everything I mean it makes everything so reliable and media and accessible and maybe you can talk about we've seen some really great success with influence or marketing on Instagram particularly in the case of raffles maybe you can jump in and talk about why you think that is that it's a successful\nYeah well I think the study is marketing a lot of people look at it as if it could be\nKind of outside of the comfort zone that it's just you know by by by don't have anything to do with me\nBut this one's a marketing works because there's kind of a relationship that's already built with the person\nSo if someone that I followed ready for a year and I know about their family I Know about what they do on a day to day basis and they're telling me like oh this really cool raffles happening you should sign up I'll be like oh okay you know like I really feel part of your life that like you're like a friend to even though I've never met you\nBut British layer of everything and there's a bizarre yeah but you know like it works like especially like Instagram Stories like ICU eating your breakfast like how many miles activist your in your breakfast but we're not in the same location where like\nYou know I could see you're talking and I hear you and I have a comment back to you so like I'm kind of like your Instagram friends even though you have two million dollars\nRight and you're going to I mean you're going to take advice from your friend more than you are going to take advice from an ad you see on the screen\nRight it's also important influence or marketing that like you have to make sure that the raffles on target with the brand of the person because like a lot of these times you'll find like\nI Know there's one in influence or who just like takes every single raffle accounts like one day there rattling off barbecue chicken wings and next day there rattling off cheesecake an exit wrestling off like a castle and I'm just like whoa where you're coming from\nVersus like other influences who like they know what's on Brandon the only take raffles that make sense of your high influence or new wrestling with the Tesla car makes so much more sense than wrestling off cheesecake\nMhm 'cause it doesn't it doesn't feel natural if it's if it's not on brand for the influence there doesn't feel like something your friend would recommend if they're just trying to tell you everything down there right\nUm yeah it's interesting and it's also like budget wise that's a very smart move because a lot of times people will\nSort of um [noise] you know influence or marketing is above let's get a big influence or let's get the biggest following and then let's let's pay them a million dollars and they'll do a post and we're gonna make a million dollars back if it's not a lot of times you can get a lot more bang for your buck if you find an influence or with a smaller following but I'm a more targeted following like I mean I I'll bring up the test a raffle again\nUm you could find somebody with you know ten million followers he charges you a million dollars will post or five hundred thousand dollars opposed to sell raffle tickets\nOr you can find specific Tesla influence there's um influence ours was in that speech about maybe sixty Seventy thousand followers but all of their followers are Tesla fanatics and you have a much more concentrated base and you're paying a lot less because you know a ... you pay per basically per follower when you when you're doing influence or marketing and a lot of ways\nMarried so she was ... saw how important it was that people who actually have a Tesla fan base because that's like something that's definitely on target the whole life has done to Tesla and I have something new owns a tussle being like guys I have a ... I Know you love myself so now you could get it passed a law\nSo that is definitely important I have to find someone who's in that like market and to understand that category\nBut we do like a lot of rattled especially with like ... which is not exactly a category it's more just a lottery it's finding people who like new things like car into art in ... who are with that includes like totally understand you know like the ... in the past and the culture\nSo it gives them like you know they're just like oh my gosh this is a cool thing that's never been done before you answer and you could win in each month on thousand dollars like that's cool\nRight and that's a good that's not just for ... a raffles but it's a you know it's for any sort of marketing at the point you have to sort of get into the mindset of who who's going to be into this so with ... which is like an an a sort of interesting model in a raffle which is it's a subscription base rivalry to enter when ten thousand dollars every month\nUm you have to think about like who's going to be into this is a new concept as a new idea\nI'm your odds are really high of winning\nBut it's you know at a subscription based who's going to be who's going to be into this concept then you have to get into the mines and it's a lot of times with the people who who are into the latest in the new west and are open to new ideas and then where are we going to reach those people you might not reach them unconventional platforms that might not be reading ... Wall Street journal you don't know\nThey're they're ... you know you have to sort of think about how are we going to reach them what's the best way to reach them and what mediums can we reach them through\n[noise] um and I I'm just looking over my notes here another interesting thing that I'm looking at is\nUm it's cool it's talking about like ... some of the reasons that we enter raffles that we don't even it's kind of crazy to think about what goes on in our brain that we're not even cognizant of\nBut um it seems that I'm In any in any sort of sport uh you know if it's a basketball for it's an activity um doping is released when you when it's that it's that like chemical something I don't know I'm In marketing I don't know if I had um\nIt's that chemicals some sort of something that's released in your brain that makes you happy right that's what does that mean diets and it seems that that same chemicals released even ... even when you almost when the weather if you make the shot do don't mean it was released if you almost like the shot Doberman is still released and that sort of what happens with rifles like\nYou win sick that's amazing you don't win but you feel like you almost one or you could have won you still somehow for some reason to feel good about it there's a strange sort of our lord took to that almost when which is interesting right which is also really important\nTo Lebanon marketing like even after I lost Tesla next I signed up for desert so\n[laughter] so I still haven't won a lot of winning this one okay All right for you thanks you can get November um okay I think that we're we're pretty much wrapped up this was you know look at some of the recent campaigns we've done at bottom line marketing group I'm Rena fighting off have you because I think\nYou really ... and early on uh for this a few of your brief explanation about the psychology about ... infant I find the scene so I'd move here and be on your show well folks that wraps up another great edition of mind your business and of course as you know the conflicts\nEvery Sunday in Tempe in tune in again next Sunday night at ten pm for another great additional mind your business right here on Seventy seven W.

the way the baseball so any so ABC [noise]\nDiet\nVigil in Pittsburgh Brazil's new president I'm Evan ...\n\nIn Pittsburgh thousands of people gathered at the six Presbyterian Church where an interfaith service remembering the eleven people killed and those wounded at the tree of life synagogue on Saturday among those who spoke was Israel's minister of education and diaspora affairs Naftali Bennett\nWell we treated him and his PSA also is zero zero zero zero zero zero\nThat's how he likes it he likes his PSA to be zero and we're talking about uh sixty six year old man from ... to be a woman from Jamaica she's marriage came to the sun and she had a colon cancer three years ago she lost weight should call and ask ... calling us could be show the cancers shed surgery in a neighboring state\nAnd then she had chemotherapy for a couple of months but she stopped chemotherapy because she was allergic\nShe wasn't offered any other treatment and now it's come to us with back pain and we found cancer up and down the spine up and down the spine so she has stage for cancers shed surgery it didn't work she had a recent PET scan\nIt showed lymph nodes in the abdomen masses along the threats ... spine\nAnd we offered to treat her to eliminate the pain and the cancer that's a beautiful thing about radio surgery as it as a\nHigh success rate in treating cancer high success rate in eliminating the pain and this is what we do so many patients come to us with pain so many came all doctors have patience with pain and they just keep on giving cable frequently giving narcotics and came up\nAnd yet not send the patient here when we know that our treatment can focus on the cancer that's causing the pain and by doing that we can help get rid of the cancer and the pain simultaneously and this is the work that we do every day\nAnd we'll speak about sixty six year old black woman and I say that because in the black community\nThe death rate from ... from breast cancer is twice\nIt's twice as high this woman's a corrections officer she's single she has a son she has left breast cancer\nShe was diagnosed a year ago she was sad that it three years ago showed an abnormal mammogram but nothing was done about that she was an seen by a throat doctor because of lymph nodes and the next year a biopsy which is suspicious for cancer\nAnd she went to another facility another biopsy and started chemotherapy the chemo doesn't work the breast cancer kept on growing shed marked progression of the cancer in multiple sites the chemo did work I mean no chemo for breast cancer [noise]\nOnly works temporarily the cancer kept growing in the bone lymph node elsewhere ushers can play of left hip pain shed fatigue she came to be weighing a hundred and thirty five pounds two years ago she was a hundred and sixty pounds she lost twenty five pounds she's five foot three\nSuch a terrible pain I examined her on the left side shut multiple lymph nodes and the neck and the Supreme Court Vicki what that's the areas to press a Latin word means above above the cloud call and then the lymph nodes of the neck\nThere was a forest centimeter mess almost two inches under the armpit on the left side and she had a ... centimeter mass in the breast in the upper portion of the left for us towards the armpit the right side was perfectly fine so she had stage for cancer\nShed chemo it just doesn't work that mammograms years ago they didn't tell her about it\nAnd now I can tell that she came to me eight weeks ago and she came for follow up and the cancer pain\nGone so that's what happens with most patients who come to us they're quick relief of the pain and suffering and often very quick relief of the cancer itself\nThat usually goes hand in hand with the cancer so lots of good news for this woman in a difficult situation when chemo doesn't work the mammogram didn't seem to help her she came to us was treated and there's now pain free\nDoing well pleased with her progress for the first time pleased with her progress and this is the work we do exactly the work we do for the man who came from Egypt he's sixty four years old he has four children at a throat

even if it works is only work temporarily\n\nYou cannot have surgery because as up against the public side while there is no way and she saw surgeons there's no way the surgeon can remove it so they're giving came out just to give came up with the chemo was not working so what good is that it's great for the chemo company it's good for the chemo doctor it's great for the chemo hospital but

it usually means end of life care and when you go on a hospice whether it's for cancer or something else the doctor saying that you have a short period to live\nMaybe they're right maybe they are wrong it's doesn't always work that way our patients that I treat on hospice and they get better and they live for years that can that happens I have one person hospice right now the hospices so angry because the person living so long\nSo how do you get to me on hospitals well either you can take it off of hospice and you're allowed to get off of hospice if you want your insurance to pay when you go on a hospice hospices terminal care and so they don't allow general blood tests or cat scans or ... or Pat's cancer treatment\nGenerally in my experience is almost never happens so if you want to get a value added you can go off of hospice and come in or you can buy a consultation you can just because your insurance company tells you one thing doesn't mean you have to listen to them so there's always a way if you want to make it happen\nWithout getting all of us and then they could\nGet ... calls at two and two choices will ... will help you and we'll help you or your loved one be seen so

got a mammogram\nSo finally with this mass the brass you saw a doctor at a mammogram as a biopsy and they removed the lump and to lymph nodes she had a PET scan and the surgeon told her we got it all

the surgeon did lumpectomy that's removing the lump of cancer he left positive marches margins means there was cancer left where the surgeon cut so where the surgeon cut their was cancer left on the other side of his life\nWas left to their body\nAnd that's how she came to me it positive margins poster margins were positive superior margins are positive the inter margins were positive ... lymphoma vascular involvement\nThat she came to me she came to me for this evaluation for this advanced cancer that was left with positive margins they left to cancer behind while\nShe also had to

rising PSA means the cancers coming back\nAnd the patient has one chance to be cancer free and that's with focused radiation like us in the surgeon should have sent him for focused radiation but he did it\nHe gave him some hormone pills for a few months a PSA went down temporarily that doesn't care anybody that's a waste of time and men hate it\nHe could have been should have sent the man for

back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way or the symptoms I could look for that would tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out in\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient\nWon't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd then we move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health now can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nAnd about half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\n... let me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nYeah that probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by well being I mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month a month where you you know you're get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low in and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move to a very similar to the close we had for heart health they are going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live out the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in the summertime\nSome mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold Veit at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life to\nMake you feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer 'cause I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you got the vitamin D at the recommended dosage to five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get they seem to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good all you're paying for shipping and the shipping deals pretty good\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the special form of vitamin K ... foreign vitamin K to it\nNeeds to bore on and I want it to be the patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think and we'll\nTalk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic play\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty capsule and a bottle of molecularly distilled alter pure fish or I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it then\nAnd they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference\nAnd they'll come back for more but then I said you know I don't want any Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want\nEven a nine Ninety five shipping and handling what

one you can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of fish oil when he got to lose right\nRight what do you have to lose and the reason the purity agree to do this is because the executives there now

important parameters and virtues but you got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of corporate sixty seven percent so this now becomes\nThe finest omega three nutrients in the
