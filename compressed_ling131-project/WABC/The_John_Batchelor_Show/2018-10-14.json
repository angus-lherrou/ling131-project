be smart and one of the great story to tell you and and um it's more uplifting than that one but that might be the most important lesson\n[noise] when I was a PBA H Venus and we're a conglomerate and in Nineteen Ninety or Ninety One don't hold me\nWe recorded off first billion dollars a year\nIt was an amazing accomplishment when I started with the company I'll never forget it was a public company we're doing about two hundred million and here we are doing a billion dollars in sales\nWhat's nice about all the time one of the founding families Larry Philips Philips fan using was the c._e._o. my closest friend with the time was the president and\nI was the president of the shirt division at the time and we had a an amazing opportunity to celebrate\nThe billion dollars also at the time there were six living former presidents of the Venus insurance company I spoke with the head of marketing at the time and I said to him why do we do something special he had a great idea\nShould celebrating an American company in America in New York what do we take a cruise boat around New York and celebrate great idea\nGreat idea we invited four hundred people to one of those crews boats with a number of floors he said he even had an ... another incredible idea not just fireworks at sundown during the day the party started about four o'clock went to eat or nine until recall he hired a\nJet planes\nWith sky writing it said congratulations and use it amazing night\nI was very proud because I made the decision to fight all the presidents the former presidents and have them have an opportunity to speak and those most grateful to have the first president I ever worked for a man named ...\nWho set the role model for me of learning how to speak present without notes as learned how to do it because of him when I saw him speak up\nThey said something very interesting I never forgot he must have been in his mid to late seventies at the time and when he stood up he said I Want to thank you for inviting me\nYou don't know what it's like how good it feels to be remembered unlike that\nEveryone made a speech and I made a speech older division presidents the c._e._o. everyone made a speech celebrating our night after night for each one billion dollars\nAt while it was a party why would they do to celebrate there was only one reason really we were there\nTo share with the troops to share with the associates to share with the employees\nWhat a wonderful opportunity and what a wonderful company Venus was at that time so even though under the heading of celebration even though it was a party was only one reason to be that the party line this is a great company\nYou can have a great future you too can be one of the president's you two could be standing up here and making speeches when we reached two billion dollars\nIt's never a party but it has a party line but that I'll be back in a moment\nAway [laughter] [laughter] see cases [noise]\nThere is a [noise]\nFriend of

in our government and our politicians are to blame tool about the party line\nThe lack of independent thinking and the fear of stepping up we're stepping out doing what's right new and couldn't agree with everything the party says new one and yet they do we deserve better\nWhen we get you a loan talking about the subjects congressmen senators who particularly you you'd be\nTied to be really

celebrate one hundred tenth anniversary we dedicated south to its mission to protect\nThe American people and uphold the constitution the FBI story began in Nineteen oh wait with only thirty four special agent to feel the opposite over the ... the last decade the FBI has evolved into an investigative that intelligence driven American institution with nearly thirty seven thousand employees I'm fifty\nSix killed opposite status by a model of the galaxy bravery integrity FBI historian Dr John ...\nFrom the beginning we can and trusted with a lot of responsibility overall we have done that very well in a reputation shown that throughout our history where we have fallen down we of quickly responded and changed and adapted to the lessons we've learned\nDuring the miles down the FBI extended Scrabble tutu with partners employees including those who have sacrificed their lives for our country and the American public support support and Trump in our work with FBI me I'm falling housing and if if you're\nA guy a dot com sitting\nIn\nAnd Trump reactor missing journalists the lights are still out in Florida I may have been hanging\nPresident Trump does not want to halt military weapons sales to Saudi Arabia following the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal construction\nI actually think we'd be punishing ourselves if we did that corresponded\nYour moniker Roger reports new claims about the vanishing ... who entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and was not seeing coming out\nHere with the investigation has holes that are that turkey has audio visual evidence to prove that Russia faulted tortured and killed inside the consulate now Saudi Arabia has consistently denying IDs claimed saying they're baseless allegation\nWithout the cutting without losing part of your lungs without the hospital stay without the chow stoops about the ivy without the infections and possible complications and not everyone makes it through open long surgery that the ... part of the oil um usually the longest deflated\nThan they have to put chest tubes into blow up whatever's left along and then\nOnce you're healed\nIf they can send your home but she can't send your home then you go to a rehab\nOr nursing home because this woman already had trouble breathing [noise]\nWell this woman called me up she heard from a friend a radio listener and I often say that radio listeners save lives shared from a friend that radio surgery may be very useful she came in I saw her\nWe talked about all the options and I don't do the scariest thing I tell people okay you can have the surgery but remember going to lose part of your along and you can have those complications surgery is a mechanical\nRemoval of part of your body you won't have it back\nYou can have chemo but came all doesn't work really permanently to cure lung cancers it's Only Temporary measure that might shrink down the cancer for a little bit of time and then it will come rip roaring back most likely\nOr he could have standard radiation which would hurt a lot of healthy long it'll take weeks and weeks or you could have pinpoint radio surgery the work that we first brought to America pioneered for the original radio surgery this was the work we do\nWith a visible beams from thousands of angles we computerized the body we find the cancer and then from thousands of angles sending invisible beams just lay on the table ... and the treatment takes about ten minutes and then you get up and go\nAcross the street to Macy's or lunch or to work or home or wherever you want to go but you're not stuck in a hospital there's no one says no tubes and the ...\nAnd this is the work we do\nWell there's one more thing I should tell you about this lady and that is that I saw her a year ago yes I saw her a year ago and we just talked about all these options and then she said Dr Lederman I Want you to treat me\nI Do not want surgery I Do not want chemo I Want you to treat me and I treated her a year ago\nAnd she came into the office I see patients and follow but I should tell you that many people one of the most common questions I get his doctor later but how are you going to do this works\nBecause sometimes invisible beams and you get hit by a truck like by surgery you expect it to work even if you get worse from it\nBut radio surges pinpoint beams and yes we follow every patient yes we do exams and blood tests and scans whatever you want whatever you think is appropriate and whatever the two of us think is appropriate we talk about that\nWell she came back this week and had to follow up scan\nAnd number one I saw her I walked in the room and I saw her I said Mrs ...\nOxygen and she said yeah ever since you treated me I don't need the oxygen anymore I said wow\nAnd then I showed her the scan we've got a new scan they said the cancer is gone and she said ... and I said yes you're off of oxygen the cancers go on there is no spread\nAnywhere else there's no ... no bleeding though spread no chemo no surgery just a few pinpoint treatments that take ten minutes each and her cancer is gone she's off oxygen she's breathing like she's been Britain for the last decade\nShe's doing what she wants to do she has cancer free in remission no evidence of cancer and this is the work we do\nI can tell you that why did I\nSpeak about radio surgery why did I bring radio started to hear why am I the Fritz that America was ready to surgery\nBecause I understood very well there is many many people like this woman who have brain tumors and catches the mouth and throat and lungs breast and pancreas liver and bones and kidney and bladder and prostate in other sites to\nToo many dimensions lymph nodes\nAnd so many people can benefit if they only learned and that's why we're here today she went to one of the biggest hospitals and saw one of the biggest doctors and thought that the doctor would be telling her all the options but no\nThe doctor was just like a salesman for surgery\nHe never told her walking caught on you and rural part of your long and you may even\nNot have got to the hospital get off the ventilator or you can go see Dr leader in half or he asserted well if he said that every patient they probably all becoming here is two Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nMost likely because who would want to have surgery if you're going to have a competing method

and\nDVD hey Dr Lederman we're back\nIf Dr Lederman with\nKurdish we were talking about prostate cancer and he is a man who's lived the life\nOf not only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear fried and hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out of control so much of what a man does in his life\nRobotic surgery as your answer and I've been kicking myself in that took his ever since maybe the dome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with ... show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill ya oh yeah and they almost succeeded\nBut when you had that robotic surgery you said\nOh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body liquids\nAnd I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot\nI was not to go to you Dr Gilead them in and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's in his life from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then to try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was like I might as well have been a unit was input tent and naturally that plays a head game on you and that you don't even feel like you're a man any long ago it was just a bad decision and I\nDidn't have all the guidance and I should've come right to you\nFor that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery\nThat I Would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain palaces and relieve myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since it was twenty twelve and I'm Still play with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever worn you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being a continent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know in ... about that in advance\nYour men to communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in quiz it to her I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe and antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go wrong\nIt was more like Apollo Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize\nOh my God as you look at the ivy that use Strunk too and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in fact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad and sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was at my nineties maybe that's the result of this aging\nBut I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only was in good shape I was in heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery\nBecause now when your basic functions when you can't you are in a when you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect\nYou mentally and you get depressed\nBut you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you had an accident and now what do you do grab a sweater and wrap it around yourself and run off to the nearest bathroom and then you always carrying around it depends with you and you're saying\nWhy did I Do this to myself and my ... and he said no I'm not I'm asking is I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is your doctor Gilead I mean because you're not part of the old boy's club your independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYour patients painless message of recovery fully remaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nYou know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing the robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars if I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be turning them into a person who can no longer\nPhysically function why am I doing this when there are\nOther remedies and why are they doing it\nBecause this is their business the surge and all they know how to do is cut\nOut your prostate gland that control so much of what a man does and I would suggest to everyone out there a void that at all costs don't be still not don't be a dummy like I was get that value a second opinion from Dr Gilead 'em in because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and you will feel fully functional again\nThank you so much my pleasure talking about a man this round has Ninety One if you look at every looks like sixty one he's a man who's\nSon and daughter and he has high blood pressure and heart\nDisease and these bright man these can talk about anything and he does these young looking young thinking\nIn right in the back of his neck as a basal cell cancerous nodules or cancer one centimeter in size\nAnd the other biopsy and the dermatologist wanted to do most they want to do cutting cutting like salami cutting and this man just did not want cutting on his body wanted non invasive treatments for his skin cancer

I guess you can cut him some slack for that but I'll tell you this no matter what how I feel about his music no matter how I feel about his past antics\nWhen he uses his men celebrity to try and stop the killing of young black men in Chicago when he uses his platform to lobby for social justice\nI'm a big fan Kanye West regardless of what the critics say and we'll get to that a little bit later\nHas done\nWhat other so called black leaders have been able to do he got a productive meeting with the president of the United states in the oval office\nAnd he was able to demand the undivided attention of the White House press corps did you see that did you see that gaggle of press corps\nHanging on his every word and then they mocked him afterwards\nBut they hung on his every word and he\nGot live cable news coverage from all of the cable news stations\nYes he was crude in his language but he wasn't hateful in fact he offered a message of love he rejected\nThe bigoted stereotypes of politics and refused to accept the comfortable assumption that the way things are are the way things have to be and still Kanye West was Savage\nSavage\nBy the liberal media Savage on social media called an Uncle Tom and worse mainly because he was a black man who was supporting Donald Trump and that is never supposed to happen\nBecause the black vote is crucial to Democrats in the mid term elections\nBlacks came out in historic numbers for Brock Obama not so much for Hillary Clinton so the new demographic democratic strategy has been\nTo get black voters passionate about voting in the midterms is to call President Trump a racist\nIs your racist I don't know I don't know what's in his heart but I doubt it\nBecause you never heard these accusations before he got into politics yes he said dumb things\nBut you see I don't believe saying something clumsy or offensive makes you a racist\nRacism is an ugly conscious choice one\nThat in fairness could only be judged by consistent behavior not simply what we claim is true for our own personal advantage or to shut someone else up\nRacism has a deep and ugly meaning in this country\nWhen someone makes the accusations falsely for their own advantage they weaken the word\nAnd it loses its importance and speaking of racism isn't\nThe idea that someone must be have or actor a certain way because of the color of their skin the epitome of racist thought\n\nBecause that's exactly what's behind the criticism of Kanye West\n\nIt's as if when you're born you're given a voter registration card and instructions on how to act in think based on the color of your skin\n\nKanye West just burst through that\nYou may not like the way he acted you mean like the things he says but you have to you have to admire his courage to stand up for his own convictions and let me ask you this what if Kanye West is successful\nHe brought up stop and frisk\nWhat if he gets Donald Trump to come out against stop and frisk what what did he gets Donald Trump to do something about mass incarceration what Kanye West inspires a federal response\nThat stops the carnage in Chicago and actually saves black lives nuts\nIt goes out and protest about it doesn't carry signs doesn't carry chance about police if he actually gets a federal response the say black\nLives is he still went Uncle Tom who sold out black people or is the hero\nKanye West even asked Donald Trump to take the again all the make America great again hats because it's offensive to some blacks who never had it that great\n\nIn other words he was effective by reaching across the desk and negotiating with the president of the United states through love instead of ... he didn't push him away he didn't call him a racist\nHe didn't come in they're full of pain and that's how we got the president's ear\n\nBut my fear is that it doesn't matter I mean after seeing the reaction to Conyers Smith\nIt doesn't matter\nWe all instinctively retreat to the safety of our group political thought and strike out against anybody who differs from our thoughts are expectations although I think the media's response to this was more insidious was worse than that because they were doing the bidding of the Democratic party no question\nThis is a threat\nTo the Democratic party existence this is a threat\nTo the success in the mid term elections if Kanye West can attract just ten more per cent of the black vote and he's stream Lee popular in the black community if he can he can pull ten more present away\nThe Democrats are done in the midterms look I I Would expect\nThat there are some people that are going asking you to offend got us out it was used how can you defend that I that surface that you're right in the in the White House if you thought it was a charade if you thought it was a circus\nYou weren't listening\n\nHe was saying some important things you went in there with the pre determination that he is nuts and he's not\nHe was disruptive but he got your attention didn't he\nAnd he got the president's attention and he just may get something done and all these other people who say they care about black\nCauses will get anything done\nThey sit back\nWhat black users slaughtered in Chicago and elsewhere in the country they sit back they say they care but if they care to swallow your pride and go into the White House and they won't\nDo that they're too proud full to political too worried about their own profit\n\nTo walk into the president of the United states and say hey here's what should be done that's about the Philadelphia Eagles who wouldn't even go visited the White House\nThey could have said they they could have fled their case to the president they would have had his ear\nBut there are two ... two hateful Kanye West wasn't\nBut I'm sure I'll take criticism to even for bringing this up but just like ... I'm reaching out to you in hopes of finding common ground\nSo that just like ... we can make America great periods one\nEight hundred aid for a WABC one eight hundred eight forty nine to to to come

about you think I should\nGo ahead I'm Sorry I'm picking up all your time you\nKnow I'm enjoying my conversation with you and um well you know what I did prepare little for this tonight I have all these notes so let me get to like the ... whatever but right off the bat you some of my son to wrap that I'm going to repeat it because it's true but I wrote this basically Kanye West diamond in silk\nAnd Kansas oh and there are more but the three I picked on and I'm saying they are all a threat to the Democrat machine\nSo let's go to Kanye West because I did say than the silk and Kansas oh and then they're all different\nBut you know with believe it or not he is a thinker there's no two ways about it he's still he's a thinker a true thinker and he's finding himself you know and quite frankly I agree with you when it came to Taylor Swift I hated him for what he did but I think he definitely were deemed himself right now\nAnd you know what he's married to him tied dashing it has like a few children he getting up there and that they said as a thinker\nHe wants to feel a what he thinks is correct and what's the things are great and I listen to and I think he spoke things that were made a lot of sense\nAnd you know knees Democrat people that are brought up and whatever\nHave to attack him because he had a tremendous threat\nOh absolutely Russia more much more than diamond in so much more than than in Canada so and it's because they're on Fox News and so they don't count\nAnd so but no but come on you know I'm Talking about for the general black population not for me but I think you're right I I think that they look at them and go oh no no no they're just doing that for the money Kanye West woods loved\nFor being for being deep rooted in the black community for being yeah a musical leader and the thought leader of the black community and all of a sudden he says there and that's why you know ...\nYou know you know let me think about it the Democrats with oh they wanted they want to keep people on welfare instead of wealthy they want their votes for the power and these people that are on welfare these recipients they basically get very little money and they're basically trapped and that's what they want the Democrats\nAnd you come along with ... west or dining in silk of Kansas oh and and they're trying to tell you have people wake up and people are waking up the the the black community I definitely waking up they're realizing what's going on over here and the Democrats are are are trembling\nThey're reacting to write and Judy I gotta go I'm

ranger who\nUsed to call the show all the time but now he just treated me saying [noise] I think you miss use the word social justice or you don't understand that I Do know that the the term social justice has\nBeen re appropriated\nA recently especially by people who say it's a distribution of wealth\nWhen I talk about social justice I talk about things like uh what I'm Talking about is mass incarceration what I'm Talking about is A People's ... trapped in a welfare state I I talk about some of the things that Kanye West talked about\n\nAnd if you want to talk about the redistribution of wealth it doesn't you know I Know that there's this liberal philosophy the redistribution of wealth\nIs taking it taking it from the the one percent or the elite or the rich and then giving it\nTo those who are either under served or considered for\nI understand that I understand that's what's supposed to be searched social justice but the readers for distribution of wealth\nCan't be creating wealth and that everybody can enjoy it that can't be the same thing it it can't be growing in the economy to the point where people get jobs it can't be growing the economy to\nTo where people's wages go up there isn't that type some type of social justice so in using the term social justice I reject\nThat's the term has to be a euphemism for the redistribution of wealth\n\nI use social justice in his its shore is for\nJustice\nEconomic justice for everyone in society and I know that's what it's supposed to me\nThat's what it's supposed to mean it's supposed to be an economic justice for everyone in society but I reject that that economic justice can only happen if you take from someone and give it to someone else\n\nAnd so I'm taking the term back but thanks for the tweet Greg and now I'm running at a time I do want to play one thing\nOne thing the Kanye West said because the media especially CNN and MSNBC and all the networks they use all the crazy stuff they use any of them to make him look silly or where they felt like a large segment of the population would be upset with him like when he went over to hug Donald Trump\nBut what did you want to hear what you hear what he said because it's really brilliant about racism\nAnd are not going to move one of the movie that I Love the liberal side to do\nLateral product can throw a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people do and I said I'm like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh these races you think of races do get gets an invisible wall\nI Believe is racist I I don't care what the color of your skin is if you use a racial stereotype you purposely do you consciously do it to put someone down because of\nBecause of the color of their skin it doesn't matter if you're black and you're doing it it's still racist serious with it and it was it was so cowardly the way CNN did this it was right after Conyers spoken it it was Wolf Blitzer\nAnd he had done a bash and he had some other people they already they had to bring in a black person right\nThere because they didn't want to criticize Kanye West so they bring in John Lennon\nAnd he says this\nWhat I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\nAnd embarrassing Americans but mostly African Americans because every every one of them sitting either at home or with their phones watching this cringing now minstrel shows if you're not familiar their\nSkits develop back in the nineteenth century the head music performances and and mocked people specifically of African descent that's what minstrel shows were so he's claiming that because Kanye West likes Donald Trump ... were make America great again hat\nWent to the oval office met with him and then spoke to the media it was a ... because all of the people in the media happened to be white\nThat's not Donald Trump's fault\nBut if you took away that the media it wasn't full of white people there was Jim there was Jim Brown sitting right next door\n\nI'm telling you I I don't even know why play Don Lemon I don't have no idea why I don't know why he has a job I don't know why CNN puts them on\nBut\nI I we shouldn't even be playing what he said he's just everything he says the stupid everything the man says it's stupid\nLike there are some people that I disagree with that I think are pretty smart or funny like Bill Maher I like I don't agree with them Ninety percent of the time but I like them I like Rachel Maddow I think she's very smart I can appreciate somebody I disagree with if they're intelligent and thought\nOr they're clever\nI can appreciate it I I don't have to agree with it I'm strong enough to be able to fight off the opinion but be able to appreciate the time to do with the thought\nPut into it and the way it was presented none of that exist with Don Lemon\nIt does I I kind of like as the cup although she said something stupid as well about Kanye West\nI thought that was really bad um I think you had there a man who's clearly not OK and a president who is willing to exploit that\nSo Donald Trump was exploiting a mentally ill or disabled person is what they were saying so\nBecause Kanye West doesn't agree with as the cup\nHe's mentally ill because he's a black person who likes Donald Trump he's mentally ill\nAnd so old\nOld white woman on the air saying that a black person must be mentally ill\nBecause that person doesn't agree with her\n\nI I I maybe I'm unfamiliar with what racism means more to say something racist\n\nIt isn't it racist and I'm looking we have two African Americans or the other side of the glass and that's where I'm looking at right now as I'm saying is waiting for a nod of the hat or something if if there is if a black person I've ever look it away from me [laughter]\nIf a black person has the gumption to express their own opinion and it differs\nFrom from a white commentator and the white commentator says well they must be mentally ill because it was purely because of the color of their skin because they're not\nThinking you're acting the way that somebody with that color skin should think correct that's racist right wouldn't that be wouldn't it be if I assume you had to\nThink or act a certain way that's not racist\nIt's not easy saying it's not racist ...\nThat's what I'm saying oh no no no no no no I'm what I'm saying is you're right is he just whispered in my year everybody has their own opinions and we're saying the same thing but if somebody says you can't have your own opinions you can't have your own opinions because\nYou're black that if you if you stray from the box that we put you in and say you can't think that way\nIf you if you're held down and thought if you're held down in intellect and if you stray from that box I call you a name I say you're mentally ill\nThat no I'm not saying it affects me or doesn't Steve I've got to go but thanks for calling inside and is your whole last week but it doesn't matter at this moment in time\nBecause there are plenty of people that are available for every job and so there'll be plenty of African Americans and plenty of white people and so you're going to have people companies right now are just looking for somebody anybody\nThe competition for jobs right now is insane and when I say competition for jobs I mean companies trying to get people to work for them\n\nWe are we're close to full employment\nWhere everybody that really wants to work\nWorks\nAnd that's why wages are starting to go up wages are starting to go up because there's a competition for employees\n\nSo in that in that atmosphere a quota doesn't mean that much and by the way I Would I Would argue even against your basic premise\n\nI Believe there's qualified people of color if if somebody doesn't hire somebody that's not top but it it's not because of the color of their skin or because of a quota system it's because they're idiots 'cause they hired the wrong person they can find someone competent of color\nIf they wanted to they're just being lazy they're being lazy that the person being hired they see\nThe racism is in the employee ... not the employer the racism is the fact that oh my God I have to hire a certain amount of black people so I'm just gonna take anybody\nThat's racism the quotas not racist they understand what the problem is with quotas I get it we don't need them anymore we really don't I don't believe we need them anymore so I agree with you with your basic point but if you're saying the quotas\nForce people to hire incompetent people\n... that to me there's a tinge of racism in that I don't ... I think\nI think you have to know your racist and um I don't I don't buy this notion of unconscious racism so I'm saying I can construed as a racist statement that doesn't mean you're a racist you understand that\nI think we throw around that we're a little bit too much and I've thrown around a little bit too\nMuch tonight but the idea that because there is a quota you have somebody that's not competent is the fault of the hiring person not the fault of the person that got hired will continue this conversation after this that was interesting though Steve thanks for calling we're coming right back with Larry mentorship [noise]\nOf perfect time on why it matters leases them vigorously insure them and his\nGo out there and change the course of human event whatever Seventy seven do what do you have to see\nSoup talk [noise]\nScience fiction author Arthur C clocks than any sufficiently\nAdvanced technology is indistinguishable from magic remarkable memorable experiences in modern stadiums airport transportation hubs and smart cities transform public perception intelligent digital signs and\nSmart censor provide the opportunity to impress enemy while serving the public scholar a leading global technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world visit scholar dot com today to start the conversation about bringing digital transformation your modern venue\nMoney sit in the morning here let me ask you a simple question what would you rather your adult boring old lay in bed over here or your\nBed all jacked up on steroids was perfectly\nLegal so annoyed stuff and I know that introducing the most advanced sleep surface ever created them my pillow mattress ...\nVilla masses topics are gone by the way is awesome guarantees you the most wonderful deep healing sleep all your life some my fellow mattress offers made of three layers that will transform your sleep just like your strength for mine I have what is well my wife and I we love at\nFirst to form where somebody civilian support even distribute your body weight him temperature throughout the night it's all covered with a super durable and saw the silk fibers that zips right off his completely machine washable and drive to trust me if you bet it's uncomfortable don't spend your money on a new one by my poodle much tougher\nInstead and right now for you are WABC listeners get thirty percent off all knew my pillow mattress ... to standard my pillows have more great bundle but none of my fellow dot com today your news from a cold\nWABC nuts my pillow dot com\nAs one of the world's most celebrated fashion\nDesigner car locker found is renowned for his aspirational and cutting edge approach to dial phone call I've assigned brings his unique mission upper eastern chief cue America through Carla found\nParis slipped collection for both women and mom including ready to wear accessories jeans embedded fashion house ... also offers a range of watches I wear and premium Franklin is available online at ... dot com and outlawed in ... and ... are you\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI Can't walk in a while ago I was walking and find that site right right and I don't know what happened I had the after effects of that my aunt and my leg\nAnd I noticed that I accept that I don't have that\nThat I think the I Am very very well and I don't feel any that he is an issue that looks like it's like my parents are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very very upset about it\nFor a limited time used discount code W.
