T. three incident from two thousand one where a single Chinese pilot came out flew aggressive maneuvers around one of our large a multi engine a reconnaissance aircraft and then collided enforce that airplane to essentially crash land on her mind a high non island this was a full ship\nSo you cannot write this office simply the action of one bad actor and the Chinese military this is a move by the Chinese military and hence the Chinese government against the United states\nIs this Cold War activity is this what we faced with the Russian Navy in the north Atlantic and the Pacific\nYes it is so it it is I uh I put out on Twitter last night this isn't the first time the U.S has been to this rodeo\nIn Nineteen eighty eight a in a very famous incident\nA China or a Russian a Soviet Union a ship a cruiser at that time came out and actually cites wiped 'em where we made a a actual connection between the United states a destroyer the region the USS Karen\n... class destroyer\nAnd one of the Russian warships in the black sea\nThere were other ships there that the u._s. was doing a freedom of navigation patrol there uh the Russians tried to actually come alongside and actually move the American ship out of the way and the American ship did not altered course in fact stood on as we like to say maintain its course\nUm until the Russians broke off but we actually had physical damage between that\nSo the U.S navy has experienced and this that wasn't the only infinite during the Cold War we had a number of those ah but it looks like the U.S and Chinese a relationship\nIs beginning to get to that area of tension and what's important to understand is that incident in Nineteen eighty eight happened very near the end of the Soviet Union when they were feeling a lot of tension from the United states\nAnd again I think that what we saw here and just the last Seventy two hours in the south China Sea may demonstrate that the Chinese are feeling a lot of tension\nBoth from the military standpoint but also an economic standpoint after all the tariff war is not going in their favor right now\nYou have a piece of the national Review Online right now anticipating what the army the navy and the air force need for the future I Want to shape that to\nChina and the and the western Pacific East Asia do we have the fleet to this capable of responding to these reckless incidents by the Chinese would have been better for example we've talked in the past if we'd had a ... class to run the freedom of navigation act and not put in our biggest battleships\nWhat is it about saliva DNA and hair samples that help you understand what you should and should not eat good evening to\nGood evening thank you for having me on um yeah the program is perfect first we start off with a\n... by energetic and using hair saliva blood work a if a person has to bring in with them were sent to the opposite and that helps as personalized supplements or for each individual or for forty eight forty is like a program\nWhere they typically we see people losing twenty five to thirty five pounds and only for women Luke twenty five to thirty five pounds typically men lose thirty five to forty five plus pounds it only forty days were able to guarantee at least twenty and forty days and we also use DNA testing\nAnd the DNA testing on a genetic level shows things like ideal diet type exercise regiments nutritional needs\nA needs for sexual vitamins and minerals in all about fifty different metabolic factors are on a genetic level or to to help keep weight off at the healthy as possible going forward\nI learn from the people who are in your program who leave you videos or who agreed to be talked to was there ... dieting that this also allows them to go off some major league medications I mean what we're talking big time\nFarm here that they are delighted to mention I no longer take my blood pressure I no longer take my try I no longer worry about my triglycerides what is it about weight loss that is that allows them to be free of medications\nWhile the things that you just mentioned they're all one to one related to obesity unfortunately the blood pressure medications the sugar medications for diabetes the cholesterol medication pain medications I mean all these things are worse than by by obesity blood pressure and itself I mean so\nThere's not a doctor on the planet that wall today that losing weight for an obese people will dramatically improve their health\nOr we're just basically getting the getting them those results were very very quickly very very briefly I and that's why we see people\nOftentimes within the first week uh minimizing or eliminating the blood pressure medications diabetes medication these other types of medications and we see that all the time and and this is what's supposed to happen you're so close to ... go get healthier and get off big league\nMedications when you lose a lot of weight\nA bout eighty percent of all that Seventy eighty percent of all the uh health issues in this country have something to do are made worse by obesity in weight issues\nOr to charming voices on your website this is Arthur who lost thirty pounds and forty days\nHe said he's not on medication now he's off his blood pressure and I think he'd been taking met her medicine for cancer so that he had a variety of of afflictions that he's feeling better about but Heathrow remark at the end that I like you said this is especially for people who don't like diet of always failed diets do hear that a lot Dr\nWe do here that we hear that people obviously is feeding a at a at a level they've never succeeded uh before\nUh but we hear people tell us all the time how easy it is and it's easy to follow I mean you're eating regular food you're eating regular vegetables regular fruits regular proteins we do modify mixing of certain things together because of different hormonal disruptions we do a minimize fats oils that are coming in because the body is\nBurning it's all fat for fuel that's really the key here sort of minimize that but it's actually there's nothing on the food that you can't pick up in any supermarkets\nAnywhere in the world anywhere in the country really\nAlso Jerry and this sounded like a family a family tragedy here Jerry's lost forty pounds and forty days he said he's going from a forty two thirty six and he he was grinning fine and then he said it was a line that I I paid attention to no surgery\nBut my brother had surgery and he's in pain every day what's he referring to the doctor\nI think what you're talking about is ah the the brother had some sort of Barry ... surgery or some sort of stomach surgery ah and ah I from what I remember I don't believe in that went very\nWell um and I think that's what led him to our program is that he did not want to go down that road he wanted to do this without any search you wanted to do it naturally a which is what our program as there is no surgery there's no hormones no shots\nFor all natural there's no tolerance stimulate the caffeine nothing like that in the south but what's really at all natural way to go\nThe other thing I saw repeatedly and we've talked about this before is that there's a there's a confidence in the voice when they talk about this it's as if they don't believe it's themselves that they do they not only feel better about themselves they think it's a miracle\n[noise] yeah I Love to what I Love to see about it is that what people are coming in and at first are so skeptical that they're going to achieve the numbers\nAre that we tell them they're going to achieve and then by their first or second visit there not even be free and the numbers go they don't care about that now they're talking about health like wow\nI can run with my grandchildren I could spend all day working again do doing my job where I get exhausted um I I have a ton of energy at night\nMy relationship with my loved one is better my sex life has improved all these things we hear that in fact they moved away from the weight they now see it and they improve their activities of daily living a and that's what gives them the confidence in the in the happiness and really\nA choice of a choice to live life again you know it's very difficult when [noise] when uh when when you were very overweight it's it's terrible\nI have information now that you\nOur popular around the world the countries I wrote down where Israel Hong Kong India Russia Ukraine Dubai how does it work ... from far away do they come to Jersey or can you work with them\nNo we what we do it because so many people we we put up thousands of patients on the program and the tri state area and in this country but uh because people see a business or a family member or friend on a visit from where they come here and they see this dramatic\nDramatic results in weight loss of improvement of health or do they want it for themselves as bad weight issue and and\nUh they've contacted us we do a phone complication with them with and mail them a kit for they had a lot of the DNA testing or they can email that blood work a choice as well uh we go over everything with them we ship the products back to them\nAnd what's great is uh they usually in another country they'll buy a body composition scale\nThat shows we really want to monitor to make sure people are losing fat not water and the way we do that is where the body composition scale\nOr they go on Amazon or what are these other companies online they buy a um a a body composition scale uh and they monitor they write down their numbers their weight their body fat body water numbers on a daily basis in the email them to me every three to four days and I monitor personally ... remotely\nAnd we find that people do just as well or even better because they're getting monitored three or four times the amount that somebody let's say coming in here they're coming in every you know nine ten Fifteen day somewhere in there a way we monitor people every three to four days because his shoes on email and people do fantastic what if they just do great\nAnd it doesn't they don't have to come to New York to do this they can just contact you through your website is that how they do it\nThat's the correct they'll contact us through a website I can call the eight hundred number

Israel\nIt can you give an example of an operation that they've participated in in the past something that would describe where what their skill set is for because everything I've seen about the IDF as they can handle themselves\nShore um but the IDF wouldn't necessarily respond to a terrorist attack let's say in Tel Aviv I'm of the sort that happened was January twenty Seventeen with 'em 'cause the Israeli Arab name not shutting off um who went to Tel Aviv and shot up um some people sitting in a cafe\nThat it would be a mom that with dispatched to hunt him down and they located and then

John ... knock on the line cut for the president is here and one of the states that is part of the solution for the troubles in the middle of on is Lebanon it's very difficult to follow especially because\nLebanon is dominated by a bad actor has below underground and above ground and these last years it's been a placing of Malcolm is that fair that has the laws turned it into a recruitment and money center but no transparency for governance no credibility for governor\nSo we want to go to Lebanon and find out the status of what could be the beginning of a remedy although Lebanon is overwhelmed with refugee camps these days\nWe very much for police to speak again to ... she's the Friedman visiting fellow at the Washington Institute's ... program on Arab politics\nI Need a very good eating as you and thank you for this I characterize Lebanon to me as non transparent but the reporting Malcolm has done these last month is that Hezbollah is still a heavy hand is there any brightness we can report tonight about eleven good evening to\nGetting a little kid to a and think you said definitely my pleasure [noise] uh I'm Sorry to say that no there is nothing ... a good coming out from the country what we're going to be seeing soon and I've been on ... worst situation\nAnd we're looking for gay people are thinking that the formation of the government is finally going to happen to the end of this week or next week\nProbably everything from the book is going to change everything for Lebanon but the problem as now that has a lot actually controls the institution when they won the election that made on the ... election they made sure that\nNot only they won the elections that their opponents are extremely weak to have any leverage over any decision over the country for not only have a lot when wanting to find them and they are going to control the government no matter what shape the government and the other night\nThey only have two ... and peas and one hundred twenty eight\nAnd ... and the argument which is nothing\nBut they have a bunch of and I do I go to do whatever it takes\nUh to to to the to keep them on power that's how they're going to control nothing on the other hand like basic and we're seeing a lot of functions like a day but they are casual kind of mean meaning that it's not going to change much so\nAs long as the allies are not as threatened or sanctions nothing's going to change if the government is one\nAfter that the very very bad economic economical situation in Lebanon we are on the verge of an economic collapse which is not going to be good for for for government doesn't matter what governments we have as long as corruption seeps into government situations and cause but like I'm Talking about\nUm the only the only good thing I can states day and as long as Iran economy stumbling husband like financial situation I'm not looking at it at the port so there is an opportunity there\nSo we need to know when permission it's known was in the ... the United nations is you know exposed the the says well the building a um a missile production side in Beirut\nAnd what has been the reaction in the country what is the ... and I just ask a couple of parts you can still move in together\nAnd what is your reaction of the people in Lebanon with the ones who will pay the price for this I mean I Know that there's been resistance at times to ... below was building in the ... the what do you call them the missile rooms that are that we've seen ... ... ... how does that play out now\nUh I think exposing these ... as they get a because it had on the Lebanese people especially the Shia community minded that these factories and that hide out of of this housing weapons are mostly based under ... population ... population\nAnd this is good because these guys did not want any war anymore they cannot afford to have another war whether Israel or among themselves and why they can't they they've lost too much um how long does that and also they know that any a war also\nMeans that they have to the to lead read a lot of refugees knowing as you said that we have a lot of effort you that the country so\nThey can't go anywhere they have to deal with them with\nThem and reconstruction of Lebanon like the one that happened in two thousand and six is not going to happen I guess Iraq and not just send money and by the way it did in two thousand and six\nSo they don't want to ah the people do not on\nA has little to expel or to to put them in danger of the way it is but the thing is they know that people know that has has an assassin size and I've been on heaven under under the people's house the question is not whether actually the ah the on the side\nOf the the question is that they know that the messiah factories where the weapons are being converted as an injury the red line and this is let's carrying the people is that nothing you know did not come out and say have lots of hiding and that's all we all know that everybody knows that any kind of it with that\nBut he came out and said something much more interesting and much more scary than people is that these facilities to convert to weapons and they know that for Israel to sit there at night that's where they are actually bombing Syria and everybody scared that has gone the looting the sensitivity\nTrump give it up and on and what are they doing\nI think more exposure and more accurate exposure and not by not only by Israel by the international community in general including the media would work what goes on way in terms of getting the people I'm actually ask them questions and I would have a lot to remove these weapons or at least\nControl what three under their houses has a lot will not\nBe able to um and I know from incidents after two thousand and six people I've met size from under their houses and the land that I've seen that with my own eyes so it's it's it's as they do it they don't want to upset the shocking and all the and they don't want to deal with stress\nYour heart bronco democratic city dot com [noise]\nWith your head not over and we problem ... hundred gambler ooh\n[noise]\nNo back to the John bachelor show ...\n\nUm\n\nKnocking on line with men we go to our men on the front lines and the new Cold War your long term is senior vice president of the American foreign policy a policy council he learned oh what a flat or you know so just a moment years ago ... wrote a book about Russia collapse of Russia what I did not understand was the irony of the word collapse\nI didn't realize what we were talking about\nWas at an enemy of the liberal order and that's what we now see an enemy of transparency and a what we steam to be the community of nations are these last week said than non display in all directions you long can you help my audience understand how it is that Russia gains by\nBeing a prankster at best and Savage tour worst against his neighbors against a transnational organizations what is in it for the for Moscow how does this advance their story good evening ...\nRight so a good evening or so it's a great question and I think are a lot of it goes to a the a sort of it stems from the understanding that uh the Russians or feel like they're in a box right so so the way a a good way to think about Russian foreign policy\nIs is that Russia is constantly testing the contours of the box they feel as Biden report and said a dozen years ago that the end of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century and it needs to be revised ah in Russia's favor and so uh what\nRussia is doing is a constant process of probing or they're looking for weaknesses in the west weaknesses in alliance solidarity we they sit in political cohesion and where did they find in a an entry point or they act both his ... and a fire fighter they both create a problem you know political problems security problems\nAnd then they posit themselves as a solution to those problems and then that way they increase their geopolitical position at the expense of western nations and in particular the United states\nDid the report we discussed last week and then ... came into the press and the ways they were too about um the Iranians evacuating the ... air force base to allow Russia to install the three hundred missile defense system in Syria [noise] so\nWhat do you think this means is is this a Russia really advance and get ready to turn over to the Syrians is this a change of policy for the with them and and is Russian now looking at his future as an arm supplier two former allies of the United states\nRight now so I think it's a great question because uh the delivery of the as three hundred anti missile system is not without risk for the Russians the Israelis have said uh you know very forcefully that that the delivery of the three hundred is not going to interfere with Israeli military aerial operations\nAre in southern Syria and that they can defeat the as three hundred if they want to and ah if they do defeat the three hundred a there is a a you know there's going to be a lot of egg on Russian faces and I told my sense is that the the ...\nThat you see AT T for the uh uh move out of the\nIranians the are taking over control of by the Syrians that's a little bit of plausible deniability it gives the Russians political cover to say if the at three hundred malfunctions or if it doesn't function as well as it should they can always claim user error because the less confident people are now in charge\nThe Russians would permit which the S. three hundred to be out of their control he learned is that is that credible well I I\nThink so and the the interesting thing is at the at three hundred is if this is being built a\nLot or at the top of the line or write an anti missile defense if in fact it's actually not right there with the Russians are already and have been for several years working on the s four hundred ... not a not a technical slouch by any sense\nOf the work but it is technology that you've seen the Russians become more and more liberal in sharing with their strategic partners\nThat Malcolm but if it's in the hands of a serious right right\nIt puts them at a disadvantage it's a it's a series move gas ... with ... very broad implications even for the stuff we talked about Lebanon for\nThinking and he has in ... in ... along with others uh and now you have in the last four hundred young Turks talking but I mean there's three hundred it's it's um it's a big move from the part of Russian now and and the exporting these things it's obviously a profit motive involved as well\n[noise] right and and this is why I I think this is the point I was trying to make which at that at the at three hundred and becomes more and more of an export commodity as it becomes a more international life or the integrity of the system uh is uh going to be tested in many different ways and from the Russian you know they used to have\nA very strict command and control over this technology increasingly as they as three hundred goes into service against potential adversaries that might defeated a there is a level of plausible deniability there is a level of separation that the Russians need to create from this\nSo that if if things go ah don't go serious way uh in the case of\nFuture Israeli aerial operations and the Israelis happened to defeat the system a there is a Russian argument that says well they weren't using it properly the technology is perfectly viable uh this is really use rare\nYou John been on the forefront of discussing at sensing analyzing the Chinese involvement in international affairs or in in ... you know and you wrote a very interesting piece a which is something we thought about a lot about ... about the Chinese targeting the Muslim population there um\nYeah it was so ... what is the the can you can sit outside the policy and and what is being implemented obviously human rights abuses are are incorporated in that policy but is the new anti terrorism state law and it's a berries structures are going to really make a difference in this regard\nAnd I mentioned that whiny the foreign minister chastised Mike or a secretary of state Mike Pompeo because the Chinese are claiming the [noise] the detention of up to

great lakes and Andrew McCarthy\nOf the national Review Online we are in pursuit of a puzzle the puzzle is no longer Josh Russia gate the puzzle is also Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general of the United states\nThese last days have created a significant number of questions that do not have answers at this moment to my understanding gentleman a very good evening to you since last we spoke\nRod Rosenstein much in the news yes for the ride on air force one and the and the generous words by the president of the United states about a conversation with Rod Rosenstein but at the same time the expectation was that this week the residency and would be testifying to Congress the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the events of may have twenty Seventeen much in the news since the revolution in New York Times weeks past\nThat Rod Rosenstein joke to a remark chore mentioned in some fashion spoke of the twenty Fifth Amendment and that in itself is surprising\nGiven that it doesn't seem entirely logical that the deputy attorney general speaking of an amendment to remove or ... or a foreign unfit president to step to the side\nAnd also spoke of this report in the New York times wearing a wire which I think is Justice Department or a speak\nFor using a lifting device or in some way to end snare a person's remarks that can be used against him in future in court\nAnd the New York times reported that and it was at the time regarded as either ingest or speaking light of that is not know that is no longer the case because since then\nWe we have ... of James Baker the chief counsel of the FBI\nAre testifying the ... to the Judiciary Committee\nThat he believes that Mr Rosen's team spoke of this wire and spoken the twenty Fifth Amendment more than once and to to people it goes to report in the administration\nSo I come to you Andy first if I've got the timeline correct so we get to this moment when Rod Rosenstein expected to testify be to the Judiciary Committee\nNot only will not appear so far\nBut also will not pass to the Congress notes from that period of may have twenty Seventeen to justify his remarks that he was not being serious good evening to you and\nGood evening John well I think that one of the things that are ... is unrealistic about the reporting John or at least something that's being skipped over without more ah without the thought that it deserves is why Rosenstein was suggesting\nThat the president the tape recorded\nIn terms of trying to make a decision about whether this is jockey or whether there was something serious about it obviously Rosenstein did not want the president\nA tape recorded because he was trying to make a criminal case on the president what the ... the thought that was going through Rosenstein is mind during those eight days when he was we know\nDistraught because of the reaction particularly of Democrats to the memorandum he wrote a in support of the ultimate firing of of a a ... director called me\nA what was going through his mind than was\nThe potential that President Trump because there was a sort of erratic performance because there were were different rationales offered to the public for why Comey was fired because Rosenstein was being bitterly criticized\nWhat Rosenstein was talking about was gathering evidence\nTo indicate that President Trump was unstable for purposes of ultimately supporting a twenty Fifth Amendment move so the idea is\nThey tape recording of the president and the discussion of the twenty fifth ... the twenty Fifth Amendment can't be separated or desegregate it they're they're two parts of the same all\nThe idea was that Rosenstein himself or others who\nWere having meetings with Trump in the White House we're going in there to uh in Rosenstein is mine record the president not just so that they could have recordings of the president it was in order to try to provoke conversations that would show he was unstable\nIn order to get some momentum behind this whole twenty Fifth Amendment pushed\nSo the thought that this was a joke to me is really quite unrealistic when you think about not only those two things the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment but also the fact that this whole eighth day period\nBegins with Rosenstein very distraught\nOver the fact that he's being criticized over the call me memo\nAnd ends on may seventeenth with Rosenstein not moving forward on the twenty Fifth Amendment but appointing Robert Mueller as the special counsel there's nothing jockey all are about anything that happened in that eight day period and again I think it makes no sense to talk about\nWhether Rosenstein mentioned\nTape recording the president because I don't think there's any if ... if Rosenstein himself is admitting it but claiming it was ... that means there's so much evidence that had happened that he doesn't feel like he could deny it so then you have to ask yourself you must ask yourself why on earth\nWould he be talking about that and he was talking about it in the context of the twenty Fifth Amendment Saturdays\nTammy all all because of as you said before his reputation correct It's really about air\nI really do believe so if that he is and I think again we have to go back to that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back it's hard to put yourself\nAnd to put our listeners in the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is the Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running it was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure\nAre still has not happened at the Justice Department\nBut I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very

is the John ... shows that is McCotter my colleague we're having a conversation with our colleague Andrew McCarthy that Rod Rosenstein and his decision not to appear before Congress not to give Congress\nContemporaneous notes of the events of may twenty Seventeen when from ... from a Andrew McCabe the former deputy\nDirector of the FBI and Jim is James James Baker the former chief counsel the FBI when we're told Mr Rosen seem discuss the twenty Fifth Amendment in wearing a wire those important days but at the end of those important as\nMr Rosen's teen after considering other candidates appointed Bob Mueller Robert ... a longtime friend of James Comey the fired FBI Director to be to be the head of the special counsel investing investigating Russia gate but now we get news and who knows if you can confirm it because it's a leak through\nUnknown sources now we get news that\nRod Rosenstein argue with James McCabe in front of the now momentarily hired Robert Mueller\nAbout recusal and refusal over whether McCabe should or could should not have worn a campaign T shirt and a family picture supporting his wife's bed for state Senate I Know this is all you have to go back to twenty sixteen\nBut the McCain drive down inside with the Democratic party very prominent in the Virginia politics\nAnd a Rod Rosenstein apparently had this argument why we know this now\nAnd the I'm going to guess that there's that there's a competitive leaking going on here from attorneys because this very much looks like Rosen seems leading against McCabe whereas this started when McCabe lead against Rosen esteem or and or the Congress with ... a a permission leaked against Rosen seem so\nThe public is like a tennis match Andy the public's go ahead going back and forth from court to court how do you how do you interpret this latest leak we ... we can't confirming that Roosevelt seen as having a an argument in front of Bob Mueller\nI Believe John that it's a defensive or or\nMaybe it's a I Would I should say is the best defense is a good offense on behalf of the Rosenstein camp and I do think that the Rosenstein camp is doing a lot of chirping in the last a week two weeks\nWith respect not only about this but about all of the ah that that important may ninth to may seventeenth period that we've been discussing we've heard a lot about Rosenstein in connection with that particularly after the New York times article was concerned so I think this is the peace with that\nAnd why now I say that this is the best defense equals a good offense approach on Rosenstein part what I mean is if I'm McCabe or frankly if I'm Jeff Sessions\nI hear Rosenstein talk about conflicts of interest and I think is he kidding\nIn in terms of him pointing out my\nPotential conflict of interest between ... as opposed to his actual screaming concrete conflict of interest is almost hilarious I mean if you think about it McCabe may very well I've had a conflict\nAnd certainly people at the bureau thought enough that he did that he was ultimately removed from the case probably much longer a afterwards then he should have and in terms of the Clinton email\nInvestigation 'em by his conflict was in for rent show from the fact that he was involved in [noise] democratic\nPolitics just like Jeff Sessions potential conflict of interest was also in suffered from the fact that he was involved in the Trump campaign and there was a little factual piece of it because he had had these meetings with Russians although it seems to me that they were those meetings were much ado about nothing\nRosenstein on the other hand uh\nSeems to me to have a screaming\nConcrete conflict of interest in the sense that there is\nNumber one and investigation of obstruction of justice involving the president and that by the way was reported today in the Washington Post at the FBI considered themselves involved in an investigation of a criminal investigation of obstruction of justice against the president\nIf there was such an investigation Rosenstein was an essential witness in that case because he had drafted the memo that supported the firing of called me and the firing of called me was the event that people were thinking of as potentially obstructing the Russia investigation\nSo he has a very concrete conflict of interest with respect to that and then if you if you add onto that the fact that\nPfizer gate becomes an issue in the sense that everybody Congress and everybody else is now looking at these Pfizer applications well who signed the fourth ... application but Rod Rosenstein\nSo in terms of both the criminal investigation involving the president and the congressional investigation involving the surveillance of the Trump campaign\nRosenstein is an essential witness so he has the conflict to end all conflicts\nAnd if he was raised in conflicts with other people and not recognizing the clear conflicts that he had a I I gotta say something's wrong here\nWe've got about a minute ... go ahead\nAnd what happens now and they can one minute [laughter]\n[laughter] well what happens now is I think we continue to monitor the twists and turns here but I Do think that things are a reaching a a day new mom with a with Rosenstein richer climax in any event\nYeah ... ... that is you have a feel for Congress in Congress and losing patient can you tell this as it because it's now into a year or two and Rosenstein continues to be ... ... troops\nAre I think some of them are but the vast majority of them are right now heading into reelect and that's what they're getting into a November ... they're less than a month where that's number one thing on their mind right now\nAnd Andy that's practical he can defy them as long as Congress is at risk and if the Democrats come up in charge of the house is he free\nYes if he if the Democrats come up in charge of the house\nUh other than how he comes up and lowering it does and I don't really see that much of a problem for them or it's the question of whether that's problematic for and then I think you're right it Democrats when the house is free at least for twenty ... twenty twenty\nAndrew
