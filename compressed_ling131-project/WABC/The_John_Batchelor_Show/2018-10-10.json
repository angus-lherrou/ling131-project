particular that already had a showdown with the European Union and of course the European Union evaporated into a pilot jelly\nUm uh but the the United States that Trump is a is ... was the big surprise for Xi Jinping\nA because he had hoped for a continuation of the uh the Obama\nA line which would have been taken by a Hillary Clinton had she become president or so and so China now has had to rebuild its strategy to to uh to confront or to push back against Trump who was\nWho stopped the or if you like the inexorable rise of the past the in the inexorable decline of the United states are now that's a that's up to say that the the PS he hasn't been engaged in some strategic deception since about Ninety Ninety Ninety One\nWhen uh the Communist Party of China itself abandoned or it's any notions of being a communist state and and in fact became\nA very much a nationalist government a mock it a a economy economic factors but the reality is that a Beijing talks globalism talks come by a but acts\nProfoundly nationalistic and is it is projecting its power for nationalistic reasons it requires control but have access to resources and food supply in a way which the United states has never had to do\nBecause the United states has had a ample domestic a mineral and agricultural resources whereas the ... seat does not so I see is literally knows that it's life is dependent on\nContinuing to dominate access to\nNot not just minerals but an energy but particularly food to give it its it's very very poor uh ability to be a producer of adequate food to sustain itself and they know that that room itself is actually collapsed because you've lost control of its of Its Food imports\nAre a nation cannot be\nSolved run a and insecure if it doesn't control its Its Food supplies a that was why the ah the battle of the Atlantic was critical in World War two because World War two transformed or Britain for them that food exporters wouldn't it food importer\nThat was that was was a huge ah a liability of fear\nSo China has to be national ... and of course it is also a in the in Xi Jinping's interested in for that by the Chinese Communist party's interest\nUm to to play the national is cod domestically\nChina talks about the century of humiliation which suffered particularly because of ... of Japan and the west going from literally the mid Eighteen hundreds a shrewd a much to the mid ... century or so there was this great feeling of um\nInferiority which is now being robustly addressed and Chinese people flocked to a authoritarian leadership\nIn the knowledge that that was restoring prestige and pride to to China in a way which had not been seen since the brief a rise if you like of the doubt and produce a sushi ... who died in Ninety nine hundred and eight\nGregory I want to apply this to where you are in Australia because Australia's economy has prospered these last decades on the Chinese demand need for resources but with\nThe Chinese assertion of nationalism I Know that uh the Australian taking note of the chat strategy that China is used in the south China Sea and it's looking at the coral sea has something to protect from Chinese encroachment\nIs Australia swinging tours of nationalism is Australia moving back towards the commonwealth visit understanding that China is a nationalist bread and not a global market\nIt's certainly a arouse a lot more discussion than it did a John had made massive encroachment into the the the political structures in the in Australia\nAre literally buying off politicians ... form a new south Wales primitive Bob ... for example a bit became a ... a Beijing and and so on and he was the foreign minister of India in Australia or just recently\nSo uh so yes there's a lot of concern about undo Chinese influence in Australia\nAre and in China is buying up agricultural capabilities and lands it's on ... a company's him and lands here so that they can really feed into the the Chinese food requirement\nOr as a result ... is now starting to import food from other parts of the world because it's exploiting the bulk of its Its Food stuffs to China\nOr this is not a healthy situation for China or frustrate you are in the butt of strayed it being a massively urbanized more than most countries in the world is a benign put six five percent urban eyes so ah the the\n... been voters tend to think are in short term and short to say they want what they want when they wanted a they don't necessarily think about this long to balance of the nation state\nBut that is starting to change again and it always changes when have ship is visited upon our country and although you say a stray fed will uh in the in recent decades because of the boom in exports to China in relative terms Australia's GDP he wants to has been growing\nHas been growing less rapidly than that of its neighbors are those uh India or which was marginally was a huge population was marginally bigger than Australia a in a in GDP tubes in Nineteen Seventy eight and he's now a massively bigger than Australia\nA China was a judge Judy pay in Nineteen Seventy eight was double Australia's now it's nine hundred and thirty percent bigger than Australia's or Indonesia was\nHeaded in Seventy eight had a GDP of Fifteen Percent of strays now it has a GDP Seventy seven percent that of a stray so in relative terms the strangest productivity or an innovative qualities have declined dramatically and will and will continue to decline dramatically\nThe or the country had five a functioning oil refineries it now has not and it has something like a Fifteen day a supply of petroleum on hand\nYes it has massive underground oil and gas resources but it hasn't actually ... done much with them most of the ah the gas is for export its astray now that the largest gas exporter in the world of it is a lot of it's not going into the domestic\nWhat what about the call the geography let's look at geography here is the coral sea threatened by China is Australia ready to just respond we've got about a minute\nYeah astray as building in the navy and air force dramatically and sit in the China would not be able to make an incredible the Carl sea area I bet it is but it is making political inroads into New Guinea Solomon Islands and other South Pacific states about a lot to particular\nUh so a straight has to respond to that history is still a much bigger aid diner in those areas that China but China is buying off individual politicians which is the key to it\nSays Canberra perceive the threat to the public educated self about the threat we see it clearly here in the east coast to the United states do they see it in the south coast of Australia\nAt no stranger is not yet proceeding the threat as in as dire times as as they should uh it is getting much more traction than it was a year ago but still not enough and the change of government actually didn't help because there was a minister who is handling relations with the south Pacific States\nWho was dismissed from the new government because she had written a letter objecting to something that new prime ministers day so a

picture\nA very good evening to you I'm looking forward to your book but I can anticipate\nA what we're describing here which is ... success of the Trump Administration following through on the business tax cut of December twenty Seventeen\nAnd the deregulation that's been ongoing since president took office your opinion right now for the Republicans who doubt is this gross going to continue into twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty good evening to you Steve Hi\nJohn through our right and how the economy certainly as firing on all cylinders it's amazing to me because we are going to get four percent growth and the third quarter we ended the third quarter as you know on September thirtieth\nOr so that means two straight quarters of a roughly four percent growth we didn't ... there wasn't a single year it eight years under Obama we got four percent growth so something big has happened with the economy it it looked it up the tax cuts it's is it is the deregulation but it's more than that it's just\nAn attitude and they'll shift at that as Larry Kudlow says the animal spirits of the economy that have been unleashed because\nBusinessmen and women that I talked to who who are you know there's twenty seven million businesses in the United states though the backbone of our economy and when I talk to them about why do you think things are so good they say\nWe know if we invest and hire more workers and expand our business the government's not going to come after us with a Billy club and strike us down so it's it's more that ... they know there was a president who is on their side who is pro business and by the way John\nIs Donald Trump likes to say being pro business just being pro worker because you need employers have employees and so it's a very positive picture is in fact I defy some of my liberal friends to show me anything that's not going right with the economy right now\nI Am the storm clouds or announced in twenty Seventeen by all the magazines and newspapers I read you know me I've gone to New York times or Washington Post the economist magazine especially the national Review Online\nThe tariff war was to ... ... was to destroy our economy and I think the market is now at sixteen thousand it didn't happen the why not\n[noise] well I think maybe it's because Trump's bark was worse than his fight you know I was there a a a week ago on Monday when Donald Trump pet is a Rose Garden\nCeremony announcing the candidate deal that was a big deal to help you know the six months ago I think people like myself and and you were worried that we might not get a new NAFTA we will call it an ... NAFTA any longer but this was a new NAFTA it's a new\nA free trade agreement for all North America which is a very positive thing for the whole region\nSo uh I think that the significance of this is not just that we've got this deal done with Mexico and Canada but it sends a signal that Trump is like dominoes she's gonna bring do these bilateral deals he's going to do one with the u._k. if they ever get out of the new he's going to do one with Europeans he's\nTalking about a trade deal now with Korea and then of course the big one John as you know\nIs the is the big stand off a that is coming against try and write\nAnd that has not hurt a Steve because China is adamant that it will not change his business plan and his business plan is to violate all the rules of the WTO to be a pirate and to have American ... economy and it will not change\nWell you know that's what they're saying but you know that China was not being report and the American media is how poorly the Chinese economy is doing I mean there's a\nThere's a panic and Beijing right now they're the stock market is down twenty two percent this year there's a lot of disinvestment in China they've got a lot of goods that China needs to sell goods to the United states right I mean they still have a trillion dollars a year that's a big part of their economy\nAnd they are worried and I think at the end of the day\nYou know I don't know if it's going to be the end of the day is going to be you know a month from now six months ago two years from now but they are going to make some real concessions here because the truth as Trump is right about China China is you said there are pirates their steel they cheat\nThey don't live by any of the agreements they promise you any business but tries to do business over in China you know you'd be sacrificed oftentimes the ownership your trade secrets your fat and it's just a system we can't live with it's going to change in this question of how long it takes ... to come to the bargaining table I think it's going to be sooner rather than later\nThe supply chains team that's been the concern that if China and the U.S remain at loggerheads the supply chain is damaged do you see any evidence of that moving around the country\nSure I mean that'll happen I mean look this is going to inflict some pain on the United states but mighty pain on China you know China needs to be able to sell goods and services to the United states they sell us five hundred billion dollars a year you put a twenty five percent tariffs on that that's a hundred and twenty five billion dollars\nThat they would have to pay and and terrorists and you know as as up someone in the White House told me recently wasn't Larry Kudlow but a high level officials said you know\nThis tit for tat you know we put tariffs on them they put their assigned us pretty soon China runs out of ammunition they're going to run out of bullets 'cause you know they we only buy a hundred and ... we only saw a hundred and fifty billion to them they they sell a five hundred billion to us so\nI I look I Am optimistic that this is going to turn out but you never know I mean you know the ... the Chinese better than I Do John and a lot of this is just saving face for Beijing and and president Z but you take that out of the equation\nYou know if it's just a very positive picture lower lower taxes lower regulations pro business pro America energy policies\nAre the lowest unemployment rate you know since the Beatles were still playing together Lois black lowest Hispanic lowest Asian well as female unemployment rate you know that that's a pretty big deal when you've got and by the way it did\nThe story of all John in the wall Street Journal on Saturday they're buried on page aid for the biggest wage gains over the last year went to the lowest skill the lowest income workers so this this really is a rising tide lifts all boats\nEnergy you've written books about energy right now the price of oil is gone through eighty five dollars the trash talking to a hundred does that help the U.S because the energy sector has been our strength these last the last years of the Obama administration\nNow doesn't help it tell you I'm worried about it actually because you're right we do for this a lot of energy and and then within two or three years we're going to be an exporter of energy but we're not there yet\nJohn and so when the price of oil goes up at the facts on the American producers American family as an American motorists so it you know this high price stays high by the way I think it's temporary the United States I've been to Texas had been North Dakota and Oklahoma I've been to West Virginia or producing so much ... job that's unbelievable\nI I think there's just going to further or encourage our a domestic producers to in Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Alaska to produce even more energy which is which is going to be a good thing as we become more and more as Donald Trump would say he doesn't want to be energy independent you watch American to be energy dominant or not there yet but we're getting there\nThe election and within four weeks you know it very well the message of prosperity is clear we've gone through the details is America listings team\nYou know that's a good question or do we just take this prosperity for granted um I don't know well but I Will say that you know the Democrats are running on repealing the tax cuts that you've got to be looney challenge to the\nTax cut is what has really provided the juice for this economy and the for the Democrats to be running around the country than we are going to raise your taxes John I don't think that's a winning message with the\nAmerican people the

I was I don't want to worry anymore right stop worry when fresh fresh positive here Bob will come back to Hubble as we come back to curiosity as we come back to me\nA these are wonderful little robots and they need our attention so we'll come back we want to go to honoring Apollo away they're finally getting around to it Bob you've influenced them\nI ... I think bill Anders more than anybody else in the ... and it influenced than this is the the uh he was one of the three astronaut on Apollo wake back in Nineteen sixty eight the first mission to go in orbit around the moon and as you point out I\nWrote a book or the first history of that mission genesis started up all the way about America's great triumph too when the space race in the sixties\nUm what happened is when when they land as he was in charge of photography and he was in charge of basically putting together the maps that they would use his guidance navigation guidance as they were coming in and around the planet\nAnd he was in at a very unique position he could recommend a lot of names to go on the on the match to help astronauts are of this mission as well as future missions we hit bottom eleven to figure out where they were and when they should do things and so he picked three ... a big craters\nI'm just on the other side of the loan\nAs Borman level and Anders and uh you know what's the tradition that ... the explorers get to name things well the international astronomical union that group of ... shirt\nOr a stuffed shirt a ... or ... is\nNames they refused to accept his name's back in the sixties and so what did he do he's been fighting them for years to try to get some of the names that he and the other astronauts picked\nFor the Apollo and the Apollo missions what happened this past weekend I was at an event in Chicago honoring the three astronaut they got together it was a big dinner at the museum of science and technology of fundraising for them they announced\nAnd I posted this on the Web page the day before with a picture\nUm that they have now named to craters which ... in view during the ... in the earth famous earth rise picture the bill

and the twentieth century a hundred years are we're living with them all the time they're on the map\nThere in the tensions that point right back to decisions made\nOf the Sikhs are the the secret treaties and Versailles Treaty of Nineteen Nineteen points to tensions in the middle east for example the continue Sykes Pico these secret agreement that was revealed after the war and its tensions with the ball for a buffer agreement that\nPromise to Palestine and with the redrawing the lines of Middle East we see it every day in the news\nThat is true in all parts of Europe Ukraine is just spin off of the Romanoff an ... empire and we can see the tension there I Wonder however go go to to empires that survived long after the first war and ran into the crack up after the second more the British and the French\nDavid the the British Empire is a unlike\nOther empires in that the British maintain that they have levels of control\nThat it's a de centralized empire they also have levels of of of of ownership\nFor example there are the Sessler dominion though where the British settlers have gone and then there are the places where Britain dominates with trade and then there are areas where Britain goes and it maintains control because it sees that is making itself and empire\nLet's speak first to confront the Sessler\nOr parts of the British Empire that would be Canada Australia New Zealand than South Africa and if you take it to heart America as well\nIs Britain at as it in the war does he believe that it needs to pay back the dominion settlers of the of the empire\n... of the secular poll if you just described are pretty unusual feet show old British imperialism compared to\nOther in a um people old British don't 'cause we would they would have been said who go out and settled by a right to call it the other side will do feel a sense of identity as being partly a British one Australian prime minister out the cold and so\nA unit independent Australian Britain's in other words you could be spraying and proud of it but so\nDo you do so on the British world and that's what comes out of the really strongly during the second World War uh they're all literally millions of people from Australia and Canada who feel still ate tonight to the old country\nAnd crow will fight in from ... in the middle east where every teeth and said that that aspect of it in hot he's won that actually strengthens during\nThe British and also treat other parts of their empire less well yeah let's speak of India because I Believe that there were a your numbers are there were a million men involved in the conquest of the Ottoman Empire the parts of the Ottoman Empire\nThat Britain are dominated in Concord in Lawrence of Arabia is most famous of course but we also have other conquest\nAnd yet they were led by British officers and India did not get rewarded in fact it was punished or you'd have to say with some of the abuses\nOf the thirties and forties how was India separate in the thinking after Nineteen Eighteen\nWell I'm Indian a political reform people like ... himself and to support the war the British war but\nRather like I monitored Irish national is saying look if we help the British to win this war which is supposedly for the liberty of small nations like that\nAnd so this will advance our case for great to liberties but I'm the Indian Army that you describe it as a volunteer army an even bigger volunteer army in the second World War of course volunteering\nCount as a multitude of sins many of these people are actually doing it in order to ensure a a reasonable fly with of a steady income for their families and so and it's\nNot exactly a will uh you know an enthusiasm for the corps but nevertheless the Indian armies hugely important um the problem for the British India is that\nThis is a huge country that they had never intended to control they don't really can probably the whole structure is based on that one of ... of dealing with the key people in the right places\nProviding them with with the the the means they need to keep that writing supporters happy so it's a constant juggling act\nIf it ever comes to force the British never have hope of holding India down um and\nThe press has become more and more acute in the twenties and thirties but what's\nInteresting is that um even in the ... mid Nineteen thirties\nWhen there is a huge argument about whether to give to India the kind of devolved writes um that have been given to the secular call it is the white settlers causes like Australia or Canada\nUm uh the British managed to do that they managed to keep the jungle ... going to a reasonable degree\nSo that it's possible for serious and well informed British officials in India or in the Nineteen thirties to him busy the idea that the Britain may still be\nIn overall control of India in the Nineteen eighties something that now seems to us absolutely incredible so one of the points\nI'm trying to make in the
