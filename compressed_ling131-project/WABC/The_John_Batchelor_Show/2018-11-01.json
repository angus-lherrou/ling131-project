London's Center for policy research and a columnist\nAt the Washington Times anticipating the mid term election of twenty Eighteen the part of the election that's not controlled by the New York times in the Washington Post that is the rest of the Trump supporter Monica a very good evening to you I Begin with the Trump promise\nOf twenty sixteen which was to grow the economy at three percent done\nThe year over year is now free present says the wall Street Journal I mentioned the Trump promise of twenty sixteen that we'll have jobs in all directions we'll get tired of winning we do not have enough workers for all the job\nI mentioned the Trump promised in twenty sixteen that people will go back to shopping again the consumer drives our economy we now have a consumer confidence number reported by the wall Street Journal in these last hours\nThe highest in Eighteen years surged in October we also have a stock market correction that he has been rosy ever since Donald Trump was elected I Believe he's fulfilled his promise you believe this translates into some success on election day good evening\nHi good evening to your job well I I'm a little reluctant to a point to historical indicators as any kind of guide pose for what you might expect next Tuesday in the mid term\nBut I Do think that there's one traditional guy who said we can look cute because Trump is such a unique personality at such a unique president\nAnd that is the presidential job approval rating and how that might affect in an off year election like this one how that might affect candidates have his party down ballot\nOver the last week or so but it's\nVery interesting Donald Trump's job approval actually over the last two weeks\nHis job approval rating has picked it up to the point where Rasmussen hasn't at fifty percent job approval which is a high for his presidency others like Gallup and other pollsters have been sort of in the mid to upper forties\nThat is very high for Donald Trump um I Know he would prefer a higher number\nBut relatively speaking these are very good numbers for the president and I think it's going to translate into support for Republican\nAround the country by their house races or Senate races I have a ... column coming tomorrow John in the Washington Times about the Trump effect on the mid term and this is one of the interesting point that that I make about the president does the president's job performance\nIn terms of meeting all of his accomplishments booming economy tax cuts deregulation exiting the Iran deal a southern border starting the wall and so on and his job approval numbers going into this election and it is quite quite striking and you're seeing that a rising Republican tide now\nThe president is starting to lift maybe not all ships but most of\nThem the president's terrific on the campaign trail those rallies are very successful I see that he's going into Florida I think he has several events in Florida or he was he's going back to Montana wherever he's been he's wrong with his base\nThere's the question before we got a particular about the house in the Senate Monica will the Trump vote of twenty sixteen turn out in twenty eight teams many of these were the Democrats or Republicans who voted for Barack Obama are they still engage do they respond to the economy\nAnd the fact that the president fulfilled his promise of\nThe short answer is yes the longer answer is it's a little more complicated in an off year election like this because you don't ever sexy presidential race at the top of the ticket so turnout is always critical\nFor both parties they want to make sure they get as many of their voters out as possible and that's why\nThe efforts by both parties for her to get out the vote efforts and so on data mining all of that is really really critical um\nI think you know there's something else going on here again it's related to Trump and again you'll be able to read about this in my column tomorrow in the Washington Times Donald Trump is such a unique figure\nThat he is he from the very beginning from June of twenty Fifteen when he announced he was able to establish\nAn emotional bond with the American voters\nNot all of them obviously a there are plenty of her sisters out there but enough to get reelected across party lines Republicans independents disaffected Democrats who were elected him president that emotional bond that these voters have with him\nBecause they look to him to deliver the country to deliver better results for them and their families which he is doing\nThings I Want to give him back up the what they might not care about their local congressman or woman they might be fed up with them or they don't like them or their their senator [noise]\nBut I think and this is just my gut talking not my head\nBut my God says that these voters who elected Donald Trump are going to come out in droves for this election because they want to protect the\nPresident they don't want him exposed to impeach mid or to Nancy Pelosi as speaker or to all of the nonsense investigations that the Democrats would do should they they gained control of the\nHouse I could be wrong about the turnout I could be wrong about the numbers I could be wrong about the motivation but my gut tells me\nThere is a dynamic here that is not being measured by these polls just like we saw on twenty sixty\nLooks connect the numbers to nurse below sea meant to blow the\nInfamous now for having said the jobs the tax cut in jobs that twenty Seventeen was crumbs we have breaking news this is to respond them is below sea this is Eric morass in the\nWall Street journal or within hours American paychecks rose in the past year at the fastest raising more than a

wage growth has continued trend gradually higher over recent corners\nMonica that's exactly what we've been waiting for to guarantee that the Democrats were wrong to vote against the tax code and Mrs

is the John ... show was to go\nThe house of representatives according to Nancy Pelosi the minority leader these many years the house of representatives is going democratic what does this mean bill but gr and we're McGovern rights main street for the wall Street Journal is a member of the editorial board\nThis is the sequel so in the event that Nancy Pelosi's production is accurate what can we expect from a democratic controlled house of representatives bill a very good evening to you I had this detail\nOr listened pillows the appeared on the Tonight Show very popular run by a man and cold there I Believe who was a comedian but often it's grave when it comes to politics I think that he speaks very poorly of the Republicans is a ... is a fair statement in any event Mrs below the was the end the celebrity chair\nSaying quite honestly and I don't quote but everybody will get the sense of it\nThat we need a leader who will bring us together not divide us and the audience applauded and I said Nancy Pelosi you are a pro if you can sit there and without smiling say that we need somebody to bring us together good evening to bill\nHi John well John you you're you're old enough to remember along with me I'm the super bowl when I'm\nJoe name it said uh not only that the jets for going to win but that he guaranteed it right and everyone thought it was a little cocky looked she asked us you know she sort of has to say that to mobilize or base um but I think unfortunately she may be right I mean\nAll the signs point to Democrats it's possible something develops it's possible that a lot of you\nBreak the other way for Republicans lobbies toss ups are within the margin of error\nBut it it does look you know with the enthusiasm that Democrats have and but also with the spending um that they have just incredible amounts of money\nThat um um she's likely to be holding the speaker's gavel when when dust clears\nI had because I've been reviewing this that in the first district of Pennsylvania the challenger has has raised Thirteen million dollars and it's been eleven compared to the incumbent who raised three and spent two and a half\nIt's ... ... ... ... and on the money all across the country for the Democrats know presuming that\nYou can't buy an election but that the Democrats will win this because political science as the party out of power does very well rounded term what can we expect from Nancy Pelosi as to\nWhy I think she's been mostly honest\nUm she says they're going to repeal or try to repeal\nThe tax cutting JOBS Act now I I think that in fact she's going to have a hard time and she thinks even among the Democrats because you know once people get in the immediate thing they start thinking is will I be reelected and are there maybe some Democrats who don't like the tax cuts butter but will\nBlock it putting their name on something\nI'm to raise taxes I don't know\nUm but they're certainly going to try whether that would get anywhere in the Senate you know again depends on whether Republicans prevail in the Senate um so there might be a lot of sound and fury in the house and I think it will stay me anything that the President Trump wants for example funding for his border wall but\nThere may be a stalemate there may be not much to do I I\nI hate to say it I actually think Donald Trump might find having someone even I'm less popular than he is or with lower ... lower approval ratings and he has a leading the party the opposition I'm not sure he he wouldn't enjoy those two years and going into an election where he could run against or below sea Democrats\nThe other likelihood as I understand it is that the Democrats are making promises now joined Adler is set to be the ... the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Adams is set to be the chairman of the house intelligence committee\nThey're making promises right now of investigate investigate investigate like and ... is that a platform for twenty twenty are they planning on cues as a rallying cry\nYou know I Would have said no but look how far they've got they really don't have an agenda here except we're going to not do anything Donald Trump wants to do and if that means\nI'm not funding the border wall that's what it means if it means a repealing the tax cuts that's what it means and they're writing that pretty far now again they have history on their side usually the party controls the White House takes a beating in the first term so they they do have a few advantages there\nBut it's amazing how far they've got with no real message\nYou know in my mind except the anti Trump but I I think unfortunately we talked about this before the Republicans have let them get their their their two legacies here what is John McCain's when McCain\nUm killed the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare repeal and replace as Republicans have promised for years\nThe result was Republicans owned it the existing health care system with all its flaws and Democrats hammering Republicans on this on preexisting conditions on drug prices because no one likes\nThe healthcare system not the conservative like us who want to reform it in market oriented ways\nAnd not the people that want singer single payer so it's very unpopular Democrats are now using bad against Republicans\nAnd of course we said that the tax cuts they haven't promoted the tax cuts I saw a figure today saying that in the Republican ads only about sixteen percent mentioned the tax cuts you know we kind of talk vaguely about the economy\nBut no one talks about the connection between those two things and if you can't talk about your signature achievement you're at a disadvantage\nThe three percent year over year growth fact now acknowledge by the wall Street Journal that was a campaign promise the president delivered the demand for jobs the constant we don't have enough workers and that's going to continue into the future consumers are delighted consumer confidence is way up\nTo ... consumer spending is way up I mean\nWe all know that ... so the puzzle here is just that not go to the voting booth next Tuesday\nWe know what I think the ... the ... the irony is I think the problem is that Republicans thought the economy would take care of itself in other words it was so good you didn't really have to sell that\nAnd I think they they didn't anticipate that the Democrats never backed down you know they didn't vote for the tax cuts right they called it a crumbs for the rich Nancy Pelosi we thought we had a gotcha when she dismissed these bonuses crows but she stuck to her guns and she's hitting the Republicans on these\nPolicy issues and the Republicans are hoping\nYou know the caravan or Mrs pillow sees an favorability is going to um [noise] you lead people to keep these key

I Believe you also visited\nA the capital of the ... I'm sure you went to the marine\nMemorial there for the battle in the second war it collectively Tom what is the challenge what is the mission for the U.S navy in the end what is called Oceana good evening to\nJohn thanks for having me on again appreciate it and ah you accurately captured or the trip in a in a couple of words that are in a word that you mentioned twice which was the word vast and uh\nFor me that was a sort of my injuring impression of of the trip where we started in Hawaii\nA man that was my actually my first time out there to see the\nPacific Fleet headquarters and or get a little bit of a history lesson on on what happened there Pearl Harbor and then we we went from there to to care about where ... is a which in and of itself is a island chain of about Eighteen hundred\nNautical miles from ... which makes you wonder how it's possible to govern something like that I'm a ... there's an island in that chain that's more than two meters above sea level so you can imagine the the challenges that they have\nWith some of the climate issues and the rising sea rising seas\nUm and then from there we went to keep up on your guinea\nAnd inventor wa to Fiji\nA ... states with my car in Asia and Guam and at home and uh the amount of\nTime we spend an airplane engine jumping from place to place really gave me a strong perspective about how vast this region is um and how important is Hawaii as you as you know from your geography lessons is only one third of the way across the ocean and so\nEverything between Hawaii and that first and second island chain is just the archipelago of a variety of different island nations that I'm\nMost Americans probably don't even think about but many of these nations were critical nations that are we liberated during the course of the Pacific war and so they're strategically located all across this vast ocean where a significant track a trade or travels through their the fishing or\nThe fisheries that exist there help feed a large part of the world\nAnd so ah the United States Navy is obviously a critical interest in ensuring that those ceiling stay open and that uh we have access to those areas and that we have strong relationships and partnerships with the governments in those nations\nThe ... the secretary of defense there's a quote that I read about your trip described by the secretary when you look at that and you look at they added on the map they are heavily dependent this is your quote heavily dependent on access to those waters and also on controlling maintenance of these waters for fishing\nThat's the economic zones out there do they talk about feeling vulnerable Tom is that what they if when you visited with them are they saying good God the Navy's finally here\nGet that sense uh to be honest with you ... what I did\nGet was a a lot of questions about where is the United states than um because what we find in all these places is that the the Chinese are being very aggressive in establishing their presence and I you know you mentioned that it was the\nThat the Chinese Navy it's really not so much the Chinese Navy I think they're looking at it as a potential place where the Chinese Navy could have an influence but for the most part it's it's a variety of economic influence or is that are that are occurring on these islands that\nEventually would create places for the the navy to have refueling and other areas of access in case a case a there was a conflict\nYou mean they're going to build parts is that what they're planning to do or by well there because that's what they're doing in the horn of Africa now they're doing\nThat yes they are contributing to all kinds of infrastructure projects there um and so some of those are port oriented others are are related to uh just basic things like agricultural centers and I'll give you an example of a and I use is one a lot but there is a\nAnd we went to micro in Asia and one of the islands and micro news you on the far side we had a\nWe had a team of CBs twenty four CBs we're very proud of them they do great work and they're building a schoolhouse there for a high school I was going to be a vocational school and they're building a very traditional concrete and plywood structure building with a\nWith a corrugated steel roof and next right next door the Chinese are building a big agricultural\nCenter with you know a lot\nOf the scale in terms of what they're doing what we're doing was very stark to me uh to see the difference there\nAnd also we've just recently in that same island pulled the Peace Corps out within the last couple of years now the Peace Corps been I'm In my car in Asia since almost the beginning of the Peace Corps so um I think the question that we were we were saying or is it a\n... most of these nations want us there um there are accepting of uh the Chinese investment and the investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there are with a little bit more of a of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other\nA smaller initiatives that give them a sort of force multiplier is and they'll give you an example in Fiji um the Australian government help to fund a fusion center there for the ... navy where they're able to see and have a sort of real time uh understanding of the ships that are coming in and out of their\nTheir fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones are clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble and that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill\nUh between Australian Israeli government which are who are friends there and I really also very present it in the region and uh with some of the island nations that don't have that kind of resources to\nWhat it has in common with Oceana is that China is in the report in terms of China of speaking to dominate certain markets or certain capabilities and undermine the U.S industrial power\nSo if we need a motive we've got one right now let's speak to\nWhat what we what can be done right away the report identifies possibilities of correcting this with investment policy regulation and legislation does that does that overwhelming Tom right now too many different directions is there one of those we can we can work on right away\n[noise] well I think that uh I think what happens if you only work on one than than the others overwhelm the approach or taken in one of those\nAir you need more people time you'd need many more people say well\nClearly were trying to build the order everything you know as you know are trying to build a much bigger navy and um and that's necessary but uh I think you know the I think the biggest challenge that we have\nUm is is developing that political consensus and I think you have to have that in order to address and all these multiple fronts that's the difficulty and I think you mentioned that as well um\nThis is a sustained effort or it has to be a sustained effort and that is one of the challenges we have and government um I experienced it last time I was here in government trying to drive a lot of a transformation in the business mission of the department\nUm and you recognize that large organizations only change over extended periods of time or even the biggest a corporation the U.S took when they went through their transformation journeys [noise]\nTen years ago there was you know ten years of sustained effort\nSame CEO in place a catalyst teams all over the organization driving change and it is a it has to be a sustained effort and so hopefully we can get that kind of focus\nBut we're we're all we're all subject to the political winds were most of the leadership here the senior leadership here are political appointees over here for a short amount of time the challenge we have is setting the departments that we're organizing on a path so that those changes can be institutionalized and carried forward\nLet's look at the common sense of this I'm following the stars and stripes reporters um the fact is we depend on foreign manufacturers for some critical components for the U.S navy rocket motors machine tools gyroscope night vision systems\nAlso at the same time we have only one from in the United states ... stars and stripes are boarding\nA that produces the propeller shop for your shift\nAnd is that something that can be done by just sitting at a table and saying guys we gotta we we got to run around here we've got to diversify\n[noise] well it is I mean that that is not the only area where we have that kind of owner ability we have the same problem with sand wall castings which is are the critical element for rotary wary when gear boxes and we only have one source for that and the entire United States\nWe only have one single source that supplies all the large caliber gun castings a firm orders and tank turrets and um we have to figure out a way to try and more competition into that into that system and it's not going to be easy but I think uh [noise]\nUh we I think as you mentioned uh what what our adversaries are doing are creating a sense of focus in a sense of urgency around us and so we are going to address it\nUp first a finally the word incremental is and and the idea of transforming suddenly or is that a debate at the navy right now of what what you can do within that timeframe is that how you think about it [noise]\nYou know channel a lot of the the acquisitions that we make and as you look at our or a Thirty Years' ship building plan the fact that we have at thirty or ship building plan tells you something about the way we think about\nOur ships ah it takes a very very long time to build them and uh and to to plan for them because the industrial base cannot pivot quickly uh there's a lot of long lead time\nThat has to be brought into those and so um there are certain things I there are certain areas where we can make rapid change but others I think there is there is a sort of a combination of a incrementalism as well as rapid change I think right now where\nWe're at the navy has gone through a variety of inflection point Senate history um I had been sort of tossing around the idea of you know where are we right now in that continue on with you start with you know\nMaybe naval force one point or being there six for it gets you know where we're under sail and cannons and getting close to each other and fighting that way and then\nWe moved to stay in power which totally revolutionized the speed at which we could we could move ships and lack of dependency on whether if that's maybe to point out one then maybe three point O.\nUh after the end during the civil war wear armor plaguing and in larger guns move this under the battleship air and then the battleship era than if he quips by what happened on December seventh Nineteen forty one and the carrier strike group\nA sort of naval force for point out I think everything since then has probably been four dot one for a two for about three or are we at the point right now where\nWe need to be thinking about what naval force five point oh actually means\nAnd are we prepared or to make that shift away from sort of an incremental approach to a more dramatic shift to something [noise] ah that's kind of sustain sustain our our maritime superiority or into the future and I think those are the types of debates that we are having a maybe not frame that way that sort of\nIntellectual construct that I've just been tossing around with with my staff here but something like that I think is what they're talking about it the war college and in other places about are we really at that inflection point where where we need to think about things or dramatically differently\nFinally Tom a big picture\nOr after your trip to Oceana and I know you're doing an audit oh which we need to know what we what we need to buy for the U.S navy\nUm wet when you travel because urine Annapolis graduate and you've been navy your whole life I understand that but when you travel these days\nTo people talk about the navy as a vital element that they must have overseas and at home do they understand that the U.S is only as strong as the navy or is that something that has to be taught again\n[noise] um I Will tell you John that I think the people that I visited on this trip and these various nations that are out there in the ocean I'm probably believe it more than people here um and I think that's because they're they're out there and they recognize the vulnerabilities that they have I think that uh\nI don't think it's a hard case to make I think when people see the data and understand how much of our of our\nOur economy is dependent upon foreign trade and how much of that trade traveled across the oceans um disruptions to that would be a extremely detrimental to our ... our economy and our society at large so I think there's a general understanding but probably not a specific understanding\nAnd certainly not a visceral understanding of that sort of within people's\nEmotions that say yes this is the most important thing that we need to be we need to be focusing on with respect to our national security but um as you said before you know we are facing a challenges now\nAdversaries now who are much more sophisticated and are not going to wait for a year that is correct Thomas Thomas\nMostly the under secretary of the United States Navy I looked more conversations is the navy goes through the challenge of building the defense industrial base by ... and at the same time dealing with the vastness of the Pacific I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAlexa\nPlay hits from queens okay\n[noise]\nThere was a music uh voices

he's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution riding most recently in defining ideas he teaches law at NYU in the University of Chicago we turn our attention\nShort of the mid term election I'm twenty eight teams to the concept bandied about often on campaign trail\nDemocratic socialism no longer progressive isn't certainly no longer liberalism democratic socialism there's some outspoken voices Bernie Sanders the\nPresidential candidate from Vermont speaks often of it and Richard has an essay asking what is it and what does it mean democratic socialism\nRichard a very good evening to you your essay reminded me that there was a candidate for the governorship gubernatorial race in Florida his name is Andrew Gillum he is now the mayor of Tallahassee\nHe until twenty Seventeen\nLed a group that also a celebrates democratic socialism and I read from their mission statement because it reminded me very much\nOf what you're dealing with when you come across young adults\nWho want to know what happened with socialism and the twentieth century isn't it a good idea that we all share\nWrites this group led by Andrew Gillum on their website until he resigned this is the segment called economic justice quote we know that ... predatory capitalism as a threat to the safety wellbeing and survival of our communities and our planet\nAs wages stagnate an intergenerational wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few pathways to opportunity are becoming less and less access accessible to the rest of us\nWe are uniquely aware of the importance of challenging our system of predatory capitalism\nAnd working towards a set of institutional arrangements which allow us to access the necessities of life from housing food and substance and healthcare I'll end there Richard because I think I've surrounded the story\nOf democratic socialism it is a dreamy utopian presentation of something without history a very good evening to\nWell yes I mean let's just start from the beginning about the system is being quote unquote predatory a predatory capitalism and going down there is actually a technical a\nTourist or anti trust violations called predation which has been urged by many and what this predation to assist stuff it consists of situations where vendors sell goods that lower prices and higher quality than their rivals and the ... will come to court and saying this is an unfair form of competition that it ought to be suppressed\nA everybody who makes those kinds of claims essentially is try to keep a price floor at the cost of consumers in order to help themselves as inefficient competitors and if you don't do well these actions to take\nPlace what will happen is that the in Syria competitors we exit the market will become superior if you do allow it to take\nPlace it means that the new interests will not be able to gain a foothold and so the stagnant economy will come because you quote unquote stopped the predators what's missing in this analysis of predation under these circumstances really quite simple\nConsumer welfare also matters and when you raise prices and would you lower\nOr access to goods what you do you make the life of ordinary people a little bit more precarious than all otherwise meet\nAnd so what is the gums talking about is how is this going to affect consumers\nWould you have to realize is that by a protecting one set of competitors you make the life of consumers more precarious that also increases the likelihood of disease because you have less food and it decreases the opportunity for employment because there are fewer jobs going around as the old from stagnate with some kind of government protects\nHe talks about the problem with what you're supposed to do about the health of the planet and so forth and if he thinks that what capitalism means is that anytime you create a form of pollution you are going to protected against liability he doesn't understand that along with freedom of contract goes to the development of the system is tort law\nWhich is designed to protect against a wide range of aggression is the most obvious so these are kind of killing and murder incest and robbery and rape about nuisances whereby you spill pollution on the private property\nOr in the public lands in waters has always been regarded as the kind that we're wrong for which the appropriate remedy is human joined it um if you have time and you require damages to be\nPaid if you don't have some mix the two if the situation turns out to be more complicated\nSo the capitalist system has no particularly used for somebody who thinks that the way to protect private property\nFor yourself is to destroy private property of somebody else and the rule that you've always followed in these cases is that you use an anti nuisance law because you must take into account the last set the nuisance inflicts upon somebody else and that turns out to be a social loss not just a private four so\nCompetition is a positive some game a tort creation including nuisance as a negative some game the traditional capitalists theory understands that Mr Gillum clearly does know\nThey're trying to figure out whether or not\nOne sister or another is going to work for the long term benefit of the community\nOverall output has\nTo be critical so it would take a place like Venezuela and it turns out that you so destroy the means of production that people flee the company there's open starvation and the latest report sort of course of rampant disease that takes place which always happens when\nPeople are crowded together under nourished in various kinds of location of the Democratic socialist cannot solve the problem of coordination the way in which markets can they don't believe in prices\nAnd what they do is they assume that somebody who knows so little about the operation of an economic system like this a government government of toil candidate in Florida is a term rather miraculously competent to run a system that he doesn't understand\nAnd the great insight from the ... tradition\nIs that prices give you information about good so worth\nWithout having to do detailed inquiries as to whether the people think do or want it makes it an exchange system rather than an administrative system it's more subtle it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody the\nPresident's council of economic advisors Richard has a link to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic
