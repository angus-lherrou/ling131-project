{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "So she did the program for thirty days stopped the program two weeks short before a vacation to get her little ... to get the reset couple of days and then she came back in and she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of Fifteen days\nAre and what should the cool thing is she was away so she stopped the program she's thirty days or lost a bunch of weight loss for twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on like a vacation for for ten to fourteen days\nAnd didn't put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she was fifty days of the program\nAnd lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yes that's great to vacation in ... in the middle of say you must you must have customize that one for her\nBut yeah we have to add a little data ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans should have been away and look I'm not going to tell somebody about to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and ... which grade is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore\nOr and when she came in we we were able to do we did the hair on saliva by energetic scans gave her a hormone support gave her thyroid support she needed Packers support also\nAnd she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used also to help keep the weight off the keeper ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid ... you know is really important when you're talking about people that are coming in a lot of times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot to say I read really that I dont gotta get bind\nWith sodium to get into the south of the thyroid or to eat fruit to even work so that's why\nYou know people have a sluggish thyroid a lot of times you'll see waking and the problem might not even be what the thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance and the\nAnd the uh the the the iodine may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so\nYou know that conversion the tea forty three ah is really good that's the that's sort of the the gas pedal to the metabolism so to speak and if that's what happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance in what choice and balance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before it because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got thyroid issues\nAnd just not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid not being able to get the even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get to the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's so important your body is just an ... an amazing amazing mechanism\nBut unfortunately here and there will see a few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going\nThe wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then conversely speaking you get it moving the right way which is the body heal so great on its own then once you get a deal in the right way or you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally the one eight five five five and Jay diet a one eight five five five

Ninety two every morning correct those are pretty cool numbers\nEarly thirties his diet I cannot imagine about what the body fat to coming on the body fat went from thirty percent or twenty six percent\nTremendous tremendous right through twenty three days and it's great right so you're he basically replaced water ... percent that level has right body fat you replace it with two percent body max and my muscle mass excuse me and a two percent or more than two percent water so really that's exactly how the numbers are supposed to work\nThat's exactly what it is yeah muscle weighs more than fat and muscle has more water in it or and so when you get rid of the fat basically taken the fat out replacing it with water and those are numbers exactly what's what's really great what ... what was what was his weight loss and how much\nAh twenty point six pounds and twenty three days until yeah and you know it's interesting he really um if you look at him he he does not look like a big guy he's

and be an early subscriber 'cause it's a pretty new channel and that is the general feeling channel\nSo we talked about the H. E. A. and now we're going to talk about melatonin and I'm pretty excited about talking about this because I'm going to give you some information about melatonin that you may not know\nAnd I will bet that many of you\nDo know that melatonin can help with sleep everyone knows melatonin as sort of the sleep ... supplement many of my patients I asked if they if they have trouble sleeping only take melatonin most of them said yes they try to\nThey may they may have had success with it maybe not a but most of them are aware that most people are aware that melatonin is a good sleep hormone but what I'm going to tell you today I don't want to say is going to blow your mind but I think you'll find very interesting\nAh so melatonin as asleep hormone has helped people get off of a fence of the ads opinions bend so they have is the teams are those medications like\nUm value die as a Pam I'm at a ban all\nThese medications that do help with sleep but they really can cause the pen and see that it's not the best quality asleep with these men's or dad opinions\nAre you do get to sleep so that's a benefit but it's not the best quality asleep and it's very hard to get off of them and a lotta times after a while even with sleep from them so they as opinions you feel worse so melatonin has helped a lot of people get off of\nA Benz oh dad's and pains and I can tell you that on a\n... as a personal anecdote I recently had a flight and overnight flight that was supposed to be for hours and it turned out to be nine hours because\nThere was a a long delay because of a medical uh situation on the plane well I slept through the whole thing and that is I slept the full eight hours on the plane with a thanks to the twenty milligrams of melatonin that I took right before the flight\nSo I was asking me a several people after the after I woke up oh what happened and it turned out that we had all kinds of issues on the plane that I slept through and that's because melatonin is so great for sleep but I can also tell you that melatonin has amazing benefits\nAnd the uh one I'll bring up first to be about headaches melatonin is a great headache medication\nUm it's produced melatonin is produced in the brain it does decrease with age and for whether it's migraines and cluster headaches melatonin is fantastic but one of the best benefits of melatonin is it's a very very strong anti accident\nOkay and it really has a very important role um as an accident and um or improving the oxidative pathways\nSo one of the ways it does that is by stimulating the production of ... to ... on ... on his one of our most powerful antioxidants but it's hard to supplement ... because it doesn't get absorbed or you can take there are some sibling will ah ways you can take ... to ... but\nThat really the best way to get ... to ... with ivy but by taking melatonin you increase\nYour are glued asylum and by taking melatonin there are some studies out there that show melatonin helps with heart disease\nAnd melatonin a has a duty or it's incredible and accident benefits also helps with cancer prevention and even cancer treatment some of the cancers that I'll mention that a medical melatonin has been studied and has been\nA breast cancer and as an um prostate cancer or ovarian cancer so obviously it's not a stand alone treatment for these cancers but it's a very valuable um advent\nFor these are conditions or it's interesting with um melatonin it has effects on the sympathetic nervous system\nSo over ... over stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to a cardiac emergencies so that's why when we're stressed for instance that stimulates the I'm sympathetic nervous system and when that sympathetic nervous system is stimulated that puts at risk for a cardiac event\nAnd so uh that sympathetic nervous system when we're not a balanced correctly or is gonna be stimulated at night in fact the highest risk of heart attacks are like five six seven in the morning\nAnd so that those early morning heart attacks are partly because of that ... sympathetic stimulation that happens I'm at dawn it's something intrinsic in our system and if it's not well regulated or we are at risk\nFor that morning heart attacks so which is obviously a a life threatening situation but with melatonin\nMelatonin helps modulate the sympathetic nervous system and that uh modulation of the sympathetic nervous system\nHelps um calm things down and actually reduces the risk of that morning heart attack\nSo a melatonin ... and it also has potential to uh have benefit for reducing blood pressure so melatonin has multiple benefits that we think of it as a sleep medication but it really should be a part of everyone's\nA supplement regimen because even if you're sleeping well and that's a small percentage of uh\nThe audience out there a melatonin can be very valuable for your heart\nFor your brain and in general even the immune system again once you have a strong anti accident on board like melatonin you are protected against a lot of those diseases that are oxidative stress causes\nSo um do you think of ... ... yes you can pick a motel owners asleep benefit I gave my a little anecdote there but the benefits of melatonin are so much more and ah so to protect your health\nMelatonin is a valuable on said even if no tone it doesn't help your sleep which if you're taking the right those a lot of times at will and sometimes it's just a matter of taking the right does\nBut even if melatonin you don't notice asleep benefit and uh you don't have trouble sleeping so you don't need a such a supplement melatonin has so many valuable benefits beside sleep\nThat uh I strongly encourage everyone to consider taking melatonin\nA it's not a ... what's ... what's interesting is even for even the eyes benefit from melatonin and that might be because of all of a chance I accident affects there've been studies that show it has a role in macular degeneration\nAnyone with macular degeneration should really be focusing on a strong an accident regimen\nOr and melatonin can definitely be part of that and toss it into a regimen\nOr there could be other it's accidents as well that one would take\nA to help with that situation but melatonin is a definitely a a key part of leading you're an accident um attack\nAnd ah the benefit of that anti accident that attack is helping your heart's helping your heart helping your blood pressure helping prevent cancer and helping your brain pretty good a\nCombination so um and even a patient's without advanced Alzheimer's were shown to benefit from melatonin\nUm and a lot of times they have trouble sleeping those those patients but melatonin has been helpful for them as well even in that regard\nAgain this is Dr Warren ... ten I'm at the regenerative healing center right in the heart of Ridgewood New Jersey you can reach me here at the studio at eight hundred a for eight WABC eight

hormone it's a steroid hormone made in the skin\nUm vitamin D um it's derived from cholesterol or in the body and cholesterol through different pathways gets converted to vitamin D\nOr you can also

necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or humility media [noise]\n\nSo how could someone find out more information about content university\nEasy content university dot com that me harder than that [laughter]\n[noise] um let's move on to the world the public relations I'm In a simplistic way not you know I Would imagine every business owner every CEO and even small business owner has an idea what it is but you as the expert perhaps you can elaborate what is public knowledge\nI'm so glad you asked people come to us and the first thing we asked them is what do you want public relations to do for you and it's so telling\nThey come to us with all kinds of things like we need to tell our story we need better awareness and I kind of kid them back and say OK filed for public office sit in the hot tub with an under age girls job finished you're on the front page\nAnd they laugh and they say okay we get we get it so our question is what is the barrier that stands between any individual or company and the next level of success now let's talk about public relations\nSo public relations is all aspects of communications that would move the needle on what you need to achieve as a business\nSo that may be explains a little bit why it's so important and it has changed dramatically dramatically and continues to change and I think that's to our advantage and a lot of respects but it's an interesting universe right now\nAnd then when you say changed in many respects a key give us an example uh I mean of course social media comes to mind and we have someone sitting in the White House that one because of Twitter um you know perhaps we can elaborate on that or\nWhat that is powerful it's a force not necessarily a force for good and that that is part of the reason I'm now an specialist in crisis the are\nKind of dimension it but that standard journalism universe it still has rules they're standard journalists and procedures that are that that drive their professionalism\nA lot of the people you see though in the press don't know those rules never learned that they're there because they have a keyboard and an attitude so that\nIs one phenomena another is that the whole economics because so much communication happens ad hoc peer to peer which is in a lot of respects a really good thing but once upon a time our job in public relations was to persuade the journalists to write about us\nAnd to do it in an accurate and meaningful way that will never go completely away that it's a far far smaller percentage of what we do in achieving coverage now\nSo we we drive and ... a lot more of our own messages that means we have the ability to do it well or to do it poorly but it it's our own it's our own creation in either case\nMy guess this evening is

counter founder and CEO of snap counter PR she is the homeless in Forbes she was featured in\nMany publications and she uh took it from her hectic schedule to joined me here in order to share her advice and wisdom for anyone in the business world thank you for joining me her mind your business\nThank you well let's talk about why I like this might seem like a very simple question but\nI imagine you've been asked that and it's on the minds of many people in the business world and that is why is it so vital for a company\nTo ... to maintain its identity even if it's let's say a company that has a well known identity or doesn't have much of an identity why is it so important to maintain it\nAnd again ... whether they're doing it professionally through a public relations firm or they're attempting to do it on their own why do they have to have that mindset that they must maintain the public's eye\nWell I could give you a few good reasons but the single biggest reason is that Google is that due diligence your customers use\nTo decide if they're interested as a category a real one and even if they are interested in that category who matters son match in that damage your last opportunity if you are not there if you're not present in the conversation\nLet alone driving the conversation that decision has already made so so you've already lost before you ever got up to bat but in addition to that\nAnd match in the power if you have are are clearly in our ... describing the value proposition that you achieve and in that case even three or four hits\nThat are consistent that are highly highly credible locations you've moved the needle and press releases they used to be a way of communicating to reporters now there are way of communicating directly to the world so if you write those you are at the top of the news at the charts\nAnd you control every word so you would want to use that wisely you'd also want to make certain the messages evergreen that it's not I guess why we have a sale until Wednesday or we want to court action today because that's going to live forever you might lose tomorrow\nIt might not matter tomorrow so we just have to use those things that are available to us read more strategically\nAnd at that will serve as your best business development also your best protection against being misunderstood or miss categorized\nI'm Cheryl thank you for joining me here monuments think you proud to be here\nThank you well in our research we came across the fantastic come that you spend in Forbes\nAnd you you wrote in there I Am going to quote sixty percent of fortune five hundred CEOs have no presents on social media at all and you're going to talk about C. E. O. branding what a fantastic concept\nIt could you explain first what is the concept of CEO branding\nWell it works both for you and against you so you need to do it but you need to work for you for example the c._e._o. of United Airlines or of papa John's\nThose are situations where that individual and their brand ended up being an impediment to the company that look at other examples like eleven mosque like Richard Branson or less I may be broadly well known the CEOs Lulu lemon\nHe learned some hard lessons he's missed up at a time or two that you don't say things off the cuff and expect them not to have far reaching implications that he's a because that company eleven for example is sheriff brilliant in marketing\nThat CEO now has a regular column on Forbes and really helps differentiate what company does well that others can learn\nAlso that's value ad that makes a company valuable another example of the c._e._o. of T Mobile he has a huge huge following on Twitter and using it in a good way\nHe's advancing a lot of interest and engaging with people not in a bad misused by the president of the United states kind of way but he hasn't fluids and that's a big advantage to his company\nBut others don't have and you have to admit and a lot of respects cellular service is a commodity it's tough to differentiate it's tough to remember one from another he's done an exceptionally good job so any company with a CEO\nWho can be an influence or an expert an expert source a source of value added information is well ahead in difficult markets\nNow or do you have any particular suggestions on the platform like you had mentioned a one might use Twitter perhaps some of them use Facebook or Instagram or linked into the any or writing blogs or videos any suggestions or you have them\nI Do have a suggestion and it depends on what your company and product is so in the words of Richie Norton who is a marketing genius you could look him up preaching Norton dot com ... he's the author of the power of starting something stupid\nBut where are your customers\nIf you have a product that's a consumer product in its visually appealing or identifiable probably Instagram probably interest if you don't just wherever your customers are what are they reading what are they looking at that for you need to be\n[noise] grade point so just to stay on the ah on the topic of CEO branding is that something just for a a a fortune five hundred company or a ... a publicly traded company or even a small business should a an executive be wired in terms of their own personal brand\nThey should and and that's larger smile and this eat the smaller you are even more important now it might be for example say you're a plumber in Chicago there is a plumber in Chicago who I got online\nYou wouldn't think it was such a big deal but it is and committed to the people who are helping him grow his website an online business he was supposed he was one of those who've\nYes I commit okay alright once a week well in this case he delegated that task to his son that sudden thinking what am I going to do what am I going to do decided to put up a review what the plumbers and know that other people don't well they know the relative affects of certain kinds of showerheads\nSo he wrote a comparison chart and a kind of review of ten popular\nShowerheads what kind of useless were good for them which ones were good which were not that peace now that sounds like a simple thing it went so viral it across the ocean it went worldwide\nAnd a few months later somebody knocking on his door and it was two German gentleman who said we're makers of that showerhead you rank number two we sold out of ... on the spot we need to be partners\nWow what a story one what manage\nWow because those are my my natural questions you're going to be okay great so it's a plumber in Chicago and you know you know how is he going to scale whose business really that dramatically simply by by committing to do to pending an article once a week which we know as time that's a commitment\nUm what a story wow\nWell and in fact that plumber because of the real story he's one of three founders that did such a good job in their branding it change the trajectory of their careers\nThere there were three that I came back and revisit it in a column about how they advance their businesses in themselves through doing that job well\nSo so that's how world changing it can be when a CEO is willing to be a positive influence or and it doesn't take a mountain of time in fact sometimes the suggestion is ten minutes a day thirty minutes once a week\nYou really could accomplish so much good in that much time and if you need to have somebody in your organization help you\nAs long as it's true to your opinions and your words I call that goes to editing not ghost riding and that is absolutely fair\nIt's a great point it's I really like the ghost editing meaning\nYes have them held his brilliance right and have them help you because you know that if you just leave it entirely yourself that may not happen but don't entirely delegated because then you know you may be shocked or what you mean read\nFake news that is like the ultimate and fake news yeah\nA before and move on 'em or perhaps you having any examples\nOf CEOs who um who didn't handle either who didn't handle the c._e._o. brand and correctly or ignored it and quote unquote paid the price\nWell I'm ... I could give you many but I'll give you an example of handling incorrectly there was a phenomena that cropped up and I'm not going to name names because I generally don't if it's not a good example but they said we can automate PR here it is we do this you just tell us what you want done and\nWe're going to pitch it for you well here's what happened\nThis company was riding the pitches for the CEOs put it out and it was an automated script that started sounding an awful lot alike for every CEO\nAnd every company not only that bad things would happen when they were they would send these pictures to a target list they created and I got many many many of them and if I said no this doesn't fit my beat\nI write only about public relations so so I'm good\nThat's ignored and the auto sequence then it two weeks later says it's almost Easter can you believe it and starts the same pitch again like there was this unwritten rule that it's fair to circle back three times before you give up or four times\nAnd I started noticing that all of these\n... that the URL was the name of the PR firm so it was the CEOs name and then at the our companies URL\nAnd so I started saving them I wrote an op ed column in Forbes about the concept I didn't name the PR firm because my journalistic rules I needed to give them air\nAir to respond in and I didn't want to give them any more ... than they were already getting and it was the principal anyway not them that I was out to to end finally I reporter them to the FCC\nSent all of those messages every example of a time I and said please don't email me anymore and they did anyway in the auto sequences ten ten and you know that that has to spend something like forty\nMessages right one of my columnist friends actually reached out to the founder and said this is kind of not\nGood and he said you know I'm appalled I agree that does sound really fake and it's even they are still in that my name is put above the URL about your company as if it's me but it's\nObviously isn't right that that deal\nWith my guests this evening is Cheryl Smith counter she's the founder and CEO of snap Connor PR and you could find out more about them by visiting it's just the euro snap Connor PR dot com that's correct without trips are just went to the confirmed that\nI'm also you can find out more about content university dot com by that's that's the euro content university that I'm a a fantastic program that mix of rather simple uh\nAnd and we're not going to say automate it's not automate but to train you on how to ensure that you're putting out content grid content on a regular basis\nIs they've contractually find something that says you don't do this and also protects them that they know you wouldn't do that\nYou are so much further ahead in fact we we categorize a lot of crisis PR as the X. files the ex employee the ex partner the ex spouse the ex friend who has a bone to pick and they they take it out through negative press in negative information\nSo for a while a folk\nSinger if you're just tuning in you you you missed some greater than any throughout the show shows and created nice\nBut even though the last few minutes but no worries by Tuesday Morning ah the entire episode will be up and the permanent place where it's O M y be radio dot com and why be radio dot com ... what's what's what's clear is the ah the sounds of prevention rule is a is alive and well in the world as well\nYes it is to have time to say anything about me too yeah of course okay\nSo I've been working with a number of organizations about disasters in me too and and let me be very very clear to me too movement is a very important very important movement\nAbsolutely critical that challenge is that many many of the situations arise are not really\nAbout abuse or harassment or inequality there's something else that triggered it by declaring and me to misstep is that that's like the Trump Card it's like the God card it's like no due diligence needs to happen I declare it you can't respond game over companies\nDestroyed careers destroyed\nWe need to understand a fundamental things that the people who are the trolls who were out to just her rang and rang and rang it's a giant giant irony in my opinion that people who say their goal is to end harassment\nAnd then they're harassing how does that make any sense\nBut regardless of that one of our clients and I won't mention their name right now but I Will mentioned the brilliant thing they did they created a community council this is a very very successful event company to a hundred and ten thousand people attend a three day event that's a lot of people to corral\nAnd just over at tiny vendetta\nOne person against another it got escalated when Harvey Weinstein thing happened then as a problem that had already been posed\nResponded to and solved suddenly turned into\nA salt in the press every day what did you do when did the ... come in give us a documentation how many steps why didn't you get assaults faster on and on and on to the point that the company was chest under siege\nAt added mushrooms and some bad way spot\nThe company created a community council of experts experts in the legality an HR law in all of the inclusiveness factors women's interests all of these interest if something happens a complaint is raised and it goes to them\nThat keeps the issue the issue it also protects all parties because you can imagine how unfair it is if somebody anonymously next an accusation in the press\nAnd the company can't respond their legal team for all good reasons don't won't let them beyond just saying I can say it's patently untrue and we're going to evolve it in court\nThe news doesn't care when the court process has completed too late game over but if it goes to that council they can say they can take the whole personality and whatever the vendetta was out of the situation\nAnd the uniform and compete equally protective to both sides so that the solution they recommend has merit and there's the kind of solution they would recommend to anyone to get the thing really resolved not just to perpetuate the argument\nSo I I just find that brilliant I think we're going to see a lot more about emerging for for very good reasons\nSuch important advice ah we're we're getting low on time so just gonna keep a couple of questions focus ear I'm at the beginning of the show he talked about communication and the currency that it is for mankind um perhaps you could share some tips\nOn how executives in general uh can communicate better\nWell your audience wants to know that you really care and the engaging with it and you can't fake that that has to be real\nThere's another great expert I highly recommend Loni main red shoes living but what he kind of a ride that in his realm of work in customer experience\nWas somebody in an audience said oh I get what you want us to do you want us to stand out just like that pair of red shoes\nAnd the ... was wearing a pair of red shoes his kids have given him for Father's Day it stood out in\nA good way but a little bit like a sore thumb but the red shoes fundamentals include really listening to people\nUnderstanding the intent of where they're coming from and recognizing that everyone has the story so if you are listening with your heart not just your ears to where that person is coming from what their motivations what matters to them\nThey will know it they won't just sense it they'll know it and the world becomes dramatically different without that people may think you're arrogant\nPeople may find reasons to not connect with you or to even dislike you sell in everything that you do if you could in body those human principles genuinely\nIt it goes well beyond the words you say but it does influence the words you choose as well so I Would say remember that as just a fundamental role of living\nFolks have you know every single week we have great gifts in fact our guest is evening a clear point strategies is named or one of the world's top twenty business all he was the fall and it's not even Cheryl Smith Connor Cheryl I just have to ask you a final question if I may\nUm ... I mean you shared so much you interact with the CEOs that\nAh the companies of all types of levels in terms of a publicly traded companies small businesses um what the final four or advice can you share with the listeners among your\nIf you are passionate about the work that you do it will come through I there's a lot more to it than just saying okay I I Will do what I Love and people will show up they want\nBut if you do your homework if you find out what customers' needs are and you're genuinely care that you weren't arrogant enough to think if I Do a fine job they'll find to be you will be so successful focus in on the things that you need to do do it fully do it with your\nWhole heart of course take time out as well that if you really really apply yourself to excellence you can't lose four you'll find his strategies weather for me or others\nYou know folks this is why we're in the top ten in the media\nWe have guessed like Cheryl and makes it easy [noise] um well but but we are at a time so thank you Cheryl and folks to an end again next Sunday night for another great addition to mind your business right here on Seventy seven W.

blood test post doc specific antigen the Gleason score ... microscope sex and they chose or treatment\nAnd I should tell you that that he chose her treatment three years ago and he has been cancer free ever since his PSA is zero the sex life works is urinary life works He has cancer free he is a home run\nAnd that's really the opposite of what happens to most men who have radical surgery robotic surgery\nMost men end up with damage to their sexual life and damage to their urine or life and ... of the success rate with robotic surgery versus us river prostate book without a two part DVD and if you're interested in prostate cancer she look at the this man has cancer free as PSA zero\nIs sex life works is urinary life works He is happy and doing well and I'm happy for him\nAnd we talk about another man's in similar situations around with a higher risk cancer to Gleason six PSA eleven so once a PSA goes over time it's considered a higher risk\nHe's a Seventy nine year old man these bright man and he's got three children just marriages are tired as I call my prostate cancer diagnosis\nTwo years ago but it took them is Dr one year to tell him one year the doctor did a biopsy but to tell the patient for one year\nAnd during that year the PSA wet\nFrom four point nine to seven point eight to eleven so it more than doubled so you've got a PSA velocity how fast the essays going up doubling of the year\nAnd he came here because he just did not want to have surgery and at Seventy nine he'd be at high risk for complications from surgery even more than usual I mean the usual complications are terrible enough\nLoss of sexual function loss of urinary control but this man wanted to live and he wanted to keep his quality of life and you're still using his quality of

cancer is fifty six years old works for the MTA he just came to me I saw a day ago he's married with Assad is prostate cancer's diagnosed\nBy a doctor or one of the big places you had a PSA five point eight and he was referred for a biopsy at a biopsy showing cancer is an ex smoker I examine there is a large prostate and he wants to be treated why\nBecause she wants to be cured we've got his pathology report we gave them a copy\nAnd we kept him out for us treating prostate cancer there is no hospital stay there so hiding there is no removal of the prostate there's no override stays in the hospital it's all out patient highly successful and with this man's PSA five points zero eight police insects\nHe has a Ninety five percent chance of success higher than with surgery\nAnd keeping his quality of life intact and that's why men with prostate cancer I Believe come because they want a better chance to keep the quality of life and their urine or life their sexual life and their life not to die from prostate cancer and other men who were treated\nFor prostate cancer have a lower death rate from prostate cancer than men who\nDon't get treated so there's lots of men who are fearful of treatment but it's good to be fearful surgery it's good to be fearful of robotic 'cause it's a difficult procedure and leaves the man impaired our treatment as high success rate with high quality of

the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead 'em in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear\nFried and hysteria set in they said oh you got to get that planned out the control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery as your answer and I've been kicking myself in a took his ever since maybe the dome his decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you have been shot up with hollow show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill you oh yeah and they almost succeeded\nBut when you have that robotic surgery you said\nOh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my\nBody liquids and I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trousers I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead\nI'm In and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what a man does and it's like from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then\nTo try to have the urge to merge forget about it it was Mike I might as well have been a unit was input tent and naturally that plays a head game on you so now you don't even\nFeel like you're a man any long ago it was just a bad decision and I didn't have all the guidance and I should have come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery and I would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and\nThat's great for them and it's great for the drug company it's great for the pharmaceutical company it's great for the president that super duper big hospitals probably making ten million dollars a year it's great for the chemo doctor to give came off for the rest of

essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic\nAn author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years and medicine\nDoctor Janelle has never indoors to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only door says purity is advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program\nBank not talk to you know I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on you\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it'll give some information about how this evolved\nAbout eight years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we followed our doctor's advice in our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fund it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year or so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coal factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to it\nNeeds for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation\nCan learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I set up by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case might have been ... can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nAre Americans dying from lack of vitamin D London time\nNeglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price your PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because\nVitamin D ... it's not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin\nUpon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid hormone and the way they work that is the key there are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene\nThat is it unlocks two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the one one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D\nThat's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key on lock the right gene\nNo doctor you say we need five thousand I use per day now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering here I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out and the the new time sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side\nYou make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers or gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily\nMore doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have a blood test done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for that would tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but those are symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another as your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health\nThose are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they've been to fishing for so long they think the way they feel and the way they\nThink and the only move is norm yeah so it can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health now can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty in many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if\nYou use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient",
