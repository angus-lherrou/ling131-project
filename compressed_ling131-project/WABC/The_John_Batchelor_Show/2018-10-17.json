moved here that made the uh the moves that made the president's so unhappy last week\n[noise] no I don't think we can let's remember that the fed is large and quote powerful\nBecause the U.S economy has the largest in the world does anyone ... does Mexico not having an important central bank just be as it doesn't have Jerome Powell and\nThen burn a getting people like Janet Yellen\nNow Mexico doesn't have a prominent central bank is its economy is not that important Yemen's God when we don't talk about Yemen central banker Nigeria central bank the central bank the feds power is an effect of the size of the U.S economy\nIt's kind of like giant stadium lots of people admire giant stadium yeah well New York and the giants the rich and so they have a nice stadium the fed has an effect of all this and so the this notion\nThat it can allocate credit and set the proper price of credit on the way the economic Nirvana is laughable\nLet's remember that when we borrow we're we're seeking money for all of the world's resources trucks tractors computers desk chairs labor the fed can create that\nAnd the fed certainly wouldn't have the information to set a price the fed has a rate follower it cannot create a booming economy anymore than it could reasonably taken economy we act in the real economy as though the fed doesn't exist\nLet's go to a country other than the United states or Italy or the European Union that you profiled recently John in an article that you published it for this is Yemen a war torn\nFailed state twenty six million people well it started there I don't know how many of runaway migrated to other countries since the civil war that three or four or five way civil war including al ...\nYou make a very good case that it cannot be rescued by central bankers relate that John and how does that teach as\nWell because there's this assumption even in most schools Austrian Keynesian you name it that because central banks have essentially the power of the printing press they can fund unlimited government spending\nBut such a view isn't true or if it were true that while Yemen's got a central bank um widest\nIt just print more Rielle to save a country that's descending into chaos more government spending to basically spend the company the country back to normal what can't do that in fact the Yemen central bank had to borrow two hundred million from says Saudi Arabia central bank just to stay afloat\nAnd it's a reminder once again that\nThe fed is relevant and its relevance is vastly overstated because the U.S economy is relevant that's where it gets its swagger from it doesn't create economic health in the United states doesn't create good times and the United states how could the fed possibly do that\nBut it's large because it's backed by the most productive people on earth Yemen central bank can't do anything in fact it's got to go hat in hand out to other central banks just to stay afloat precisely because countries at war don't have a condom use generally Yemen doesn't have one\nHad said central bank is utterly irrelevant\nAre we reacting to central banks we eyes in the conventional wisdom or are the central bankers reacting to us John conventional wisdom how does it go\nOh as a conventional wisdom says that we basically follow what the central bank does that and if the fed is raising rates that's going to weaken the economy and vice versa but in reality think about it the fed follows us\nI mean let's reduce the size of the absurd what if the fed raises the funds rate to five percent more does anyone think that banks will suddenly pay five percent\nFor no absolutely not they'll they'll ... they'll low ball each other to see who what customers they can steal successfully\nThey would the fed is a rate follower look the feds rates are low because banks overnight or presently lending to one another\nOvernight at a lower rate let's also add that most lending certainly any dynamic lending in the most dynamic economy in the world occurs well away from banks that as a rule because their margins are so slim cannot take big risks\nAnd so we're following the fed at least the media is that has nothing to do with an economy that's the most intrepid dynamic in the world\nThe fed is it yesterday thought thank goodness that you and I are discussing it were me I I don't mind sane at work just ahead of the game give us five years most people agree with us why did we ever take the Federal Reserve so seriously\nAnd the answer John is that I don't have an answer is that okay I I\nCan't answer that question to answer whenever I see market ... whenever I see the markets all off because of something the Federal Reserve might do or did do I think to myself I've got a call up to me because this doesn't make any sense\nThat's right well it it it's it's a good way of thinking about it you know in a mid all this amid all this talk about the fed what were ignoring is that Mike Pence vice

bass is a region well worth exploring I welcome my colleague\nRichard ... he's a professor of law at the University of Chicago as well as at NYU\nHe is most importantly a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution writing most recently of defining ideas on climate change or as it has been said over many years now global warming the inner governmental panel on climate change from the un has issued a new report\nThat is more alarming than the last report\nAnd if I understand this correctly we're in deep trouble if the statistics demonstrated here are accurate\nThey're claiming that an order to save our understanding of how to live in the temperate zone we must room we must reduce carbon dioxide admissions by almost half\nBy twenty thirty that is in the mirror twelve years and make carbon dioxide emissions neutral by twenty fifty that is within sight of everyone who is in their thirties and forties right now it's just tomorrow\nAt the same time that kind of dramatic change in our carbon dioxide emissions will reduce our GDP by fill in the blank with we will not be\nCapable of pushing a button and ordering the Amazon anytime you want Richard I'm very good evening to you I Do not believe the BCC wants to talk about the GDP and growth but that is a major concern you have to have if we're going to follow along\nAnd the recommendations the PCC is making\nLet's get let's get right to it Richard but he's Jeannie pi is the major threat yes we're going to talk about forest fires and hurricanes but the GDP is the major threat and they the the those who advance global warming fears do not want to talk GDP good evening to you Richard\nReally it's very difficult thing to estimate but they're trying to do is to say that we have to have radical changes in the way which everything is put together a not only the way in which the energy industries work but everything that we do expect the land transportation and so forth or they have no recommendations is to exactly what should be done\nIf you thought that there were massive inefficiencies in the industries that we have out today\nSomebody said you had to make them better than they are it say okay I Will try it but they don't identify any particular vulnerable for inside the system of production of distribution and so forth and in fact if you look at a relatively unregulated economy the United states the iron is without any prodding from the IPC see\nThe Paris accords or anything else\nWe have by their own stand is the best measures of all these things namely in effect\nThe United states has managed to increase output while reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the last year two thousand and Seventeen nobody else has done that\nThe real elephant in the room is China who's\nThe missions total is twice ours are but they are still committed to a coal economy they may cut down the amount they are going to increase it but they're not going to cut it down at all so essentially what they're doing is they're trying to get everybody else to cooperate knowing that China will not this thing becomes a total impossibility for anything that you want\nAnd so what are the changes that you could start to make is a very fair question that they\nDo want people to ship ... night you wanted to make sure that the food supply is going to be very very short they try and stop innovations in drugs and pharmaceutical or the basic history as a kind of a deep on on this by all the standard measures that we have agricultural productivity\nIndustrial safety in the like the world is a much safer place now than it was it Nineteen Ninety three and a much more productive place so one would have thought hey the trend is go in the right direction or we really wanted to do is to continue to hold our technological edge and to avoid making any of these precipitous remark\nThey're going exactly the opposite direction without the slightest acknowledgement of the ways in which the changes have gone from either their\nWhat effect does this have on the GDP nobody really can do but it's likely to be extremely substantial if you'd do it but it will not be done the\nWillingness of people essentially to go to bed hungry and cold every night in order to change a carbon dioxide balance down the road is non existent and if you actually try to look at the science or they do is they say\nIs we're lowering our target for two point oh two one point five that's not all the bases erodes the base somewhat higher than that\nBecause they're trying to get it back to industrial pre industrial time and say it's a ... percent reduction of carbon dioxide admissions if you haven't shown any past this location nobody in their right mind would rely on a series of highly controversial models\nTo push things than the opposite direction when all the models that proved to be rolling up to date so I Would say in effect that this is going to be stillborn from the press it will get all sorts of abstract support\nBut it will not get any admissions or any support from any administration that actually has to do it even those states that have tried something is modest the carbon dioxide acts have essentially realize that they're highly expensive and they produce no short term benefits\nIn the new cars forest fires California had a bad and early forest fire season there were metrics just suggest that the global warming trends or the climate change ... at trends have contributed to\nFires by you represent and I believe correctly because I've read about this as well\nThat the builders and the cities that have spread into unusual areas of California have also contributed to this sense of a emergency the fires are getting hotter and bigger but at the same time we're not we're not able to do anything about it so at this point\nThe PC is measuring the forest fires will deepen because of global warming can we make that direct equation Richard\nKnow this book you're talking about changes in temperature\nAt the global level now which are running in under ten degrees\nA tenth of a degree in it you would be an enormous civil or is this just in the last Eighteen years the increase has probably been in the order about one tenth of a degree and I was standing at Thirteen percent increase in carbon dioxide levels what really determines forest fires are a bunch of other things\nI'm Jon Benet Jon ... shows segment of the global business reporter brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan from food energy to a knowledge economy\nThe republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass is a region well worth exploring I welcome bill mugger and riding main street for the wall Street Journal is a member of the editorial board return to the pending matter of discrimination question mark at Harvard especially against Asian Americans and using race or\nEthnicity as a entry filter\nAnd the larger question of does Harvard does any college\nThat participate in federal dollars\nDoes it comply or violate title six of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four which to quote from bills column prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or activity\nThat receives federal funds or other federal financial assistance and quote bill a very good evening to you these two things do not go together titles sex and what we know so far about Harvard ruling in I arbitrary fashion to my knowledge\nAgainst Asian Americans and in favor of other ethnicities on the basis of how well the Asian Americans must do as opposed to others a very good evening to you and can we leave this is a paradox or must we sorted out good evening bill\n... well it's a mess John I'm either because the Supreme Court is basically ruled on a couple of these cases ah with sort of action that it's okay to discriminate little another words race can be a factor but it can't be the deciding factor but you know where you draw the line is um is unclear [noise]\nUm ... the reason the Asian Americans are complaining is because we sort of know from places like California where they have ... whether they prohibited\nUm race being considered that Asians\nMake up about forty percent in at Harvard there about twenty percent of the school even though the population\nOf Asian Americans says you know skyrocketed in the U.S and the number of applicants to the schools has skyrocketed in two thousand nine a Princeton did a study on served tan elite universities and they found that on average\nIn African American I mean a I'm an Asian American would have to score four hundred and fifty points higher than a blackout applicant\nI think it's two hundred Seventy points higher than a Latino applicants and a hundred and forty points higher than a white applicant to get in\nWhat strikes me in your measure here is that the United states is the center of great interest around the world were a global global focus for people to educate their children that were not just national boundaries anymore to come from everywhere\nAnd I it strikes me that Harvard's unhappy decision making is based on a parochial model a national model that's out of date that fifty or a hundred years behind\nWe're we're we're attracting the best and the most eager from around the world and Harvard doesn't want to change that is why Asian Americans I mean nine I Nobel nine out of the next ten\nPeople to become middle class will be in Eurasia not in the United states there and vicious and good for them and armored isn't recognizing\n[noise] well I think that they would they would say is that they value diversity by which as we know they don't mean diversity of opinion [noise]\nUm they mean racial diversity and they believe in their own balance and that they they are the people that should be allowed to seek the balance now for many years um when\nThe uh the victims of that kind of process for white applicants people thought well that's okay ah for diversity we you know minorities Latinos and African Americans are taking their rightful place and whites would have to give a little well now it's another minority\nThat suffers as discrimination so it it defies\nAll the stereotypes and it's because they say they have this formula for diversity and and you and I are both friends with for trip seeing a lawyer right in with a law professor NYU's written very good articles on this and his view as they should be free to do that\nOr we should just get rid of the title fixed because the people who are rejected would have good offers somewhere else\nUm [noise] and uh it would free us up from the government getting involved in this bill would Harvard does is Harvard is only in court because it takes federal dollars if it didn't take federal dollars it could run it his mission the way we want it to 'em\nBut title six supplies to entity to get any federal assistance and that includes not only grants to the schools but if any of the students getting any federal financial aid [noise] um that counts too if they gave that up\nAnd they have a thirty nine billion dollar endowment um they wouldn't be in court\nThey wouldn't be in court but they can't give up titled sex you point out that they are and dominance thirty nine billion dollars and they're not going to suffer damage to that in order to comply with federal law so the the result here we're headed towards\nA a crash the these two things are going to crash and we're picking Harvard out because it's been especially creative then it's discriminate\nOn if one being sued right but everybody everybody knows that other ... other colleges other universe right through all the\nSame and in fact John to your point there was an ... brief um submitted a by many of the other schools including Yale or because they do the same thing everyone knows are to stand in for um [noise] uh most of our leading universities\nSo let's mention Hillsdale because I Know the facts here support that Hillsdale has made a stand in not taking titled sex and what does that make available to Hillsdale\nHarvard can't how well the interesting thing is Hillsdale in Harvard make the same argument we ought to be able to wear private institutions\nWe ought to be able to run or admissions the way we want to inhale feels case the way they want to is they want to be colorblind in back in the seventies the department of health education and welfare wanted Hillsdale to count older applicants by race and gender and they didn't want to do it\nAnd still founding charter I\nI I don't know one is from Eighteen Twenty one or something\nThat made it the first school in America to be open to everyone regardless of a race or gender so it was open to women and African Americans I mean long before the rest of society integrated the famously\nRefused to play in a Nineteen fifty six bowl game their football team was undefeated but the bowl officials said you can't field you're black players they said okay we're not come in and so this is the schools had a long tradition of this and they were fighting\nOr they're fighting for different things from Harvard but at the same principle they were fighting for the right to do their own and missions\nIn a colorblind process so what they did is um after a Supreme Court decision they decided we're not going to take any federal dollars anymore we're going to do it our way we're going to forego federal dollars and that includes financial aid for the students that was a\nThat was a hard thing to do you know today\nI'm more than Thirty years after they made that decision they only have an endowment of six hundred million or so um but they made the decision they stuck by and I pick up the stronger place

those lives for money the KGB now FSB and all of the security apparatus of Russia is for ever angry and vengeful towards Gordy asking\n[noise] so let's talk just a little\nYou know more about this subject not because you're a spy but because I just thought of that but I Know you've been interested in it I Know you've written novels about yeah you follow it\nAll that just talk a little about the way that intelligence services seem to be in the headlines today because that's not where they usually want to be they prefer to be in the shadows\nThey are secret keepers they do secret deans [noise] they're not interested except when they need some good publicity and a blessing and yet suddenly we have major\nPolitical scandals are the kinds of that could\nVery well result in a transformation a bilateral relations between the United states and the countries involved and in the forefront seem to be our there's no doubt about it intelligence services consider all night here in the United states what we call Russia gate\nWhich is based essentially on intelligence agencies allegations\nAbout what the Kremlin to cry\nSuccessfully are unsuccessfully to compromise President Trump then we have you mentioned it in the United kingdom the attempt it appears to kill a former he was actually a British age and they turned age and\nHe had been swap living in England but an attempt\nSay by Russian intelligence agencies to kill Mr screwball who had been living quietly in Salisbury England and his daughter and then we have now almost recently this gruesome or man in Turkey in the concerts\nOf Saudi Arabia with a journalist a Saudi journalist who was resigning with a green card\nIn the United states and actually a Washington Post a column stew apparently was killed in each of these cases it'd be needing actors are said to be intelligence agents you would agree with a premise so far\nI certainly do agree with it and I'm going to want to lay out a little bit Steve\nThese intelligence agencies have their own ideas about how to oppose there or the other country and they always have and in fact in reading about how\nThe Soviets thought of America and how Great Britain thought of the Soviet it's exactly the same the Soviets wanted market Margaret Thatcher to lose in Nineteen eighty three\nThey were and they worked very diligently to undermine their eyes that you don't need cyber warfare\nTo see how the first chief directorate\nSenate's illegals and to influence in betray\nOr the factor of government and in fact they supported labor Michael Foot was a longtime\nConfidant of KGB of agents so Steve it's it's not it's a revelation to me that in the detail because we now have the filter of Russia gate but I don't see any update whatsoever Steve they it's like both both sides have these template of how to disrupt the other government\nBut this takes me to another concept that is always put out there when we try to figure out what actually happened evidently Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the polls there\nBut the question is did know about it or was it in the word is used a rogue operation\nSo what I Want to do you suggest that we need [noise] excuse me John ... end of allergy season\n[noise] um we need to rehabilitate the word roe it's true and history teachers in recent history too that if it's quote a rogue operation it could just be a commercial criminal\nAct because these guys have all sorts of freelance operations\nThey work for the official intelligence agency but they've freelance at least Russian intelligence agencies have they work for dark money people they get involved in all sorts of criminal activities and occasionally somebody once and that\nWhich has nothing to do with politics but I Want to go to the other possibility that these rogue operations are actually political that is it's possible because you have is industry to use adjusted just before that they are run by opponents of the leader\nA router I Moscow right out of Saudi Arabia to disrupt a foreign policy that the opponents don't light now we have a history of this in the Soviet Union for example\nGoing back actually to Nineteen twenty four but the one that keeps coming to my mind I Can't place the date but it was the early sixties when there were no diplomatic relations\nBetween the Soviet Union in West Germany and ... the Soviet leader decided he was going to restore formal diplomatic relations with\nEast Germany and in the run up to that whose jobs enemies ran a number of operations to disruptive to sabotage it including a gas attack on the west German ambassador\nAnd an almost destroyed goose jobs a plan with goose jobs per pulled ahead we also out very well documented that when Eisenhower and goose jobs again they're d'etat after Stalin is there\nA and they had a third meeting planned in Paris well it must have been Nineteen sixty I think that someone set the YouTube spy plane over Russia it was shot down that disrupted Eisenhower goose jobs do not need again\nThat was the end of that date taught him a record seems to show it was set by the CIA the plane belong to the CIA that forces in the CIA perhaps the director dollars himself was opposed to detente with Russia so we come back to this idea\nThat what we casually referred to as rogue operation could be political opera involving the highest level Paul's and what are the opponents using the intelligence agencies or the intelligence agencies themselves are opposed so we do not know\nOr we may find out\nWe can Abdullah but we can't be sure whether in the case of the attack on script Paul in the United kingdom and on the case of the killing evident ... killing of the Saudi a journalist in um turkey whether the leader of the country\nCorrect ... and a bomb had been solving knew about this or these were operations against these two leaders remember that at the moment of the crop\nBoth leaders at different times were making a major effort to improve their image and\nThe judge just a moment Steve I have an example from the other side from the old Cold War professor Stephen F ...

professor Steven Cohen New York university Princeton University east west accord dot com it's a website Stephen I are having great fun tonight\nReflecting on the old Cold War and the new Cold War and spy versus spy the KGB now FSB the CIA now CIA and my five is the equivalent to the FBI in Great Britain and my six is equivalent of the CIA\nThese agencies tangled with each other all during the Cold War they continue to tangle with each other\nThey have their own political agenda they have lots of political analysis analysts within the company and they're not just all agents of acting illegals another country and doing dangerous missions very few of that\nVery few actually are occupied in that but they do have political ambitions and one is to make sure that there are at odds with the other side that increases their budgets that gives them great power and as we saw in the case of the\nSoviet Union one of the heads of the KGB moved to be the premier of the Soviet Union as we saw in the United states\nA leader of the CIA moved to become president the United states and the son of a president of the United states so from the outside\nBoth intelligence services have been politically astute for many decades are they now acting with similar ambition and Steve it's a question we can answer today Thirty years from now they'll be\nThey'll they'll have access to material we don't and they'll still be in a fog that's the nature of intelligence services they not only do disinformation they provide glimpses that you can't be certain are real when I go through the ... case and he remains\nIn in hiding or in a incommunicado somewhere in England today when I go through the ... case I Can't be sure I really can't ... how he served Margaret Thatcher and how he served Ronald Reagan and how we serve Great Britain the queen decorated him\nBut he looks from the Russian point of view to be an arch traitor and part of the apparatus that destroyed the Soviet Union it would appear that that was an accident that he didn't mean to destroy the Soviet Union what he meant was to encourage democracy as you said at the time\nIn his in his in his country\nDo we have actress today in our agencies that my five and my six CIA FBI\nWho believed that they are encouraging are strengthening democracy by undermining it you see my analogies state\nI Do but I disagree with you on one point but maybe it's not a disagreement maybe you didn't mean to included I didn't hear the case of the Russia gate allegations against Trump which are also allegations against ... that is ... tried long ago to recruit Trump or compromising and he's been success\nAnd still had I think on him and and run and run to\nThe right it's sad it's sad that is clearly a political agenda no question about it a Obama's intel cheeks particularly John Brennan editors CIA\nUh pursue this agenda record is clear Brennan's made no bones about it\nThat he was a kinda godfather of the Russia gate allegations very early on and he still pumps at out today because he has a perch on some network and he gets in the New York times on the op ed page when he wants to but it appears to be also a line of the people Trump\nAppointed to these agencies [noise] therefore it say corporate position we can't say oh it was just Brennan no it was the high level of the CIA and it seems clear to me\nThat from the beginning when Trump first out are these words earlier in two thousand and sixteen cooperate with Russia they did not want this policy and they continue to not want this policy and therefore in the case of these intelligence operations that involve Russia\nI think we can say that they are intensely\nPolitical and we can analyze them as part of the political story so\nIt raises the question we raised it before because they're mad episodes I remember in July ... forget there's so much News John but we spoke in July or when after Trump what the hell psyche to meet with ... in the first formal summit\nAnd when Trump got home he was literally cues by the New York times in the Washington Post and by John Brennan himself who is now retired of treason\nFor doing what I was simply having having add a joint\nPress conference with ... this has never happened to an American president every president since Roosevelt had met with the Soviet or other Russian leader Trump is called treasonous we're doing this so it raises a question of who's making Russia policy in Washington is Trump\nOr is it forces with the backing of the intelligence agency so we'd come now I Do in my head and I'm not a

Steve\nWell we have to ask ourselves now that we've agreed that the intelligence agencies along with the Cold War faction in Washington don't want Trump's policy we have to ask what do they want\nAnd the one thing they wanted from the get go are heavy sanctions against Russia\nAnd they've got them and they're promising more which they call crippling Trump doesn't want them but for whatever reason he goes along so it's worth an ax asking have these sanctions against Russia and against two and\nA badly damaged the Russian economy\nAnd therefore ... standing in Russia and the short answer is though they hurt and they hurt ordinary people in some ways in macro way they may even have actually helped Russia so we have these new figures that have come out in the last couple of months\nThat Russia is now running ... trade surplus exceeding a hundred billion dollars\nPartly generated by the sanctions including the sanctions on Iran oil prices soared from the mid fifties the federal budget of Russia is based on fifty three dollar world prices for oil it's now eighty four I don't know what it is today but it's in the eighties correct John wrecked so\nAnd it did what's happening is is that the hardliners here here say well\nLook how the sanctions have weakened ruble okay it causes some inflation and Russia but for Russian export companies think about this\nHigher price with a week we are ... are the dream of profitable operations because they sell oil they sell diamonds they sell everything they export abroad for hard currency which are very high prices\nThey're getting a lot of foreign currency they pay their bills and all their work their workforce their expenses at home in water now cheap Robles you understand what I'm saying yes\nNow the big problem ... has a whole is this\nYeah we laid it I think ... understandable\nTo raising the pension age I'm sixty sixty five for a man and I think that the five to sixty for women and their protest across Russia\nAnd couldn't ratings have dropped about fifty points from the high eighties to the low sixties which spilling bad for a guy who's been in power Eighteen years but stubbornly sanctions are helping\nBy driving up the flow of foreign what Russians called blue to foreign currency end of the Russian federal budget billions and billions of dollars' worth who can solve this problem\nI think food can raise the age but increase the pension or he can add additional benefits but we're giving him through the sanctions that surplus\nThat he needs to solve this problem so the sanctions are not a policy I said it

is fascinating quickly age in the first half of all this by Gallup usually considered reliable which just fly asked the people surveyed\nDo you want better relations with Russia or\nDo you want more

the John bachelor show so [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI'm John ... this is the John bachelor show Bob's gym and he keeps the website beyond the black he's the author of genesis that story of Apollo eight in the great success of Nineteen sixty eight\nNow available an audio version we go to the news right now very sad news of the last of one of the heroes of commercial space Paul Allen one half of the genius putting together Microsoft Paul Allen devoted himself to many many activities and\nExperiments and funding a brave funding a but his work on the brain especially but Bob is going to help us understand the investments that Paul Allen made into commercial space shuttle launch Bob a very good evening to you I did not know Paul Allen was ill he's lost to us it's sixty five\nA clearly a he was a very well to do man but he used his money for invention and too especially invents trying to launch so let's define what he is trying to launch Bob and what is the state right now\nTrying to launch was Allen's idea of his way of reducing the cost to getting payloads into all of it or that we've talked about it a lot of times on your show John what they did is they purchased to a seven forty sevens and they use those in their engines\nTo build what will it would be the largest airplane ever launched they call it rock are all the names of the legendary flying richer [noise] um and they've been doing taxi tests on it recently and building up to speed on the runway and they hoped in a month or two to launch and the idea was much like I'm\nNot from ... Pegasus rocket launches under the bottom of an L. ten eleven a wide body plane uh this this giant plane would have a rocket underneath it in the fuselage when it takes off any runway which gives you lots of flexibility and lowers your costs enormously takes off\nTo hire you know goes up to a pretty high altitude and then it releases the rocket which then goes into orbit and you save money in in your infrastructure on the ground you could flexibility your customers because you can launch in any inclination and location and uh you have a much more flexible and when you watch them where you don't have to worry about a lot of range of issues much fewer\nAnd um and that was the idea of the company has been building the plane for a while they've had a problem getting someone to build the rocket that would go underneath the plane\nUm and they went through over to like K which is not enough of Grumman who have built the practices rocket than they were ... they were trying to space X to do it they turned it down then they said they're going to put Pegasus rockets under rock but those are tiny rockets they don't need rocked really do that so this year the company's shuttle launch announced that\nIt's going to be building its own rockets to go under a rock\nUh several versions one of which would be a completely\nA a a some kind of like a um\nMany shuttle in a sense it would launch from the bottom of the plane go into orbit drop off a payload and then it could come back and returned to earth and so that would be a complete usable long system and so they made that announcement that's a few years down the road\nA lot must be pointed out he had shot is that Paul Allen's death this young age is is going to be a factor often is a factor for companies like this because\nThere's no question this is a visionary approach which carries great risk and when we're usually in those kinds of circumstances you need a specific powerful wealthy individual with vision at the head of the company to force it through when things go wrong a corporate\nCommittee type situation often chick chickens out they can't get it done if anything goes wrong they lose focus\nSo this ... we don't know yet how we set the company up who's going to be in charge afterward there's no names have been brought up about that company and so we're going to just have to see how it goes to the could affect them\nUm I Will say that um I had my concerns about them because they lack of getting the company to build a rocket underneath the ... the ... airplane I'm at the same time ... switch to getting government money rather than to building that's rocket independent government\nMeans we might be losing them as a low cost rocket company and then this is a company that might say that they provide some competition to space X and we need that competition so we just have to see how it plays out on\nIts last though there's no question that if he owns ... to ... sports teams a lot of ... pay a lot of money went to a lot of good cause the\nBrain now as a brain Institute I mentioned it's often a useful for items in science and nature magazine I'm presuming that law continue he does have a family but strata launches our focus on commercial space I I go from one ... one last two one failure and the failures that so used to launch\nMost recently spectacularly failing the rescue of the astronauts cosmonauts\nThere's an emergency commission set up in Russia to investigate this becomes a long process bomb what does the loss of so use means for the the immediate future for our traveled to hire staff and for missions to earth orbit\nWhere it's a little unclear yet what the consequences of the commission is going to report it's finding they say by October\nExcuse me October twentieth which is what by the end of this week they have poor moving very very fast\nThey are the surgery a cricket of who's the head of the manned space flight program in Russia is also a former ... who also is the first to flying the shuttle was the first to one of the first came to occupy obsessed by a a had a press conference last week in which he said they tend to down to what happened is\nVery very well and I don't feel and he got an Asian and like like it's like my nerves are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very worried about this product\nFor a limited time used discount code W.

eight now I moved to the success of NASA right here in twenty Eighteen curiosity there have been questions about curiosities main computer and backup computer and downloads and what is the status right now Bob on on the gale crater\nA you know what I'm not sure what the status is what I can tell you is that the last time says curiosity stop sending any data ban on down on September fifteenth\nAnd that's a month later find I check every day if there's any images appearing and finally a few days ago\nFor the first time in a month a curiosity downloaded a some images this was on a\nOctober fourteen there was a few images that showed up on the on their ... images page and so that indicated or why they finally figured out this problem they've got the backup computer working and everything's good but there's been no images since October fourteenth where a couple of days later and they usually\nSend down anywhere from fifty to two hundred images of the day when it's working great so I Do not know what the status is\nThere has been no press release or update on on the what they're doing it very clear they're making progress of some kind or the the\nThe blog on curiosity the scientists have been posting that can only comment they've seen their as curiosity is on the men\nSo I don't know yet where it stands that they did get some damages down suggests that they are beginning to get a handle on the problem with getting the computer work but at the mall but we still do not have curiosity up and running\nHigh boost to the Japanese space agency in concert with ... the asteroid and it has well hoppers bouncers landers or sending data back we have a rough her soul of high a booster to uh how did the reverse of that\nWell they haven't announced a press release of it but here's the deal a higher right where are you is so rocky and it's basically it's a rubble pile of both is there's no flat spots they found they found one good landing spot that is about twenty meters across what is that about sixty five feet\nUm but they had planned to find a place that was at least a hundred meters across that was flat three hundred feet\nAnd they haven't found anything so they decided to hold up the landing in a variety of a higher boost it till January and in the interim due to rot Herschel touchdowns are rehearsals to see how close they could get and how accurately could get into the the asteroid I'm to be able to get into that very small space because\nToo many rocks and they will have a problem\nAnd so they did that first touchdown were Herschel and you go to the link I provided on behind the black um it shows the images going in and coming out they have not released any specific details about it how close it God how accurate was but they completed that first rehearsal the second one is probably going to be a week or so\nThan the sun gets between ... and uh the earth and they won't be able to do much in December ... and December anyway November So we'll have to wait as they try to figure out what they're going to do later\nA five hundred years from where we are right now is an exception or I challenge to understanding of how planets form what are we found\nA strong um is that located a star ... light years away that's a very young star like only a ... you know several ... millions of years old and around that they found for giant planets kind of like Jupiter and Saturn\nWhich are not supposed to be there according to all planetary a evolutionary theories and how they try to figure out how social systems\nAnd so the scientists these observers the astronomers have said hey we found something your models don't work and to quote one of the planet formation models tend to focus on being able to make\nMake the types of planets that had been observed already so new discoveries don't necessarily fit the model told the truth is we having observed primary exoplanet so any theory that exist right now is based upon a insufficient\nData and so those models should not be taken very seriously\nIf it's every indicated they shouldn't be taken very seriously not to say shouldn't models\nSeriously anyone who takes the evolutionary processes styles faults here's\nBob the gentleman he the website beyond the black kids book genesis is available on the audio version he also has a book for all of you on Hubble weight

around him and then he's subordinate she's chief of staff would have cleats around them and then the Austrian aristocracy at this point\nHad turned itself into a one family industry they command did everything in the budget\nThey also had complete control of the apparatus strikingly however they were living on the memory\nOf wind Austria was powerful and friends Joe says you so we have to go immediately back to the period that from Eighteen sixty six until Nineteen fourteen what can we say about their dreams up who they believed they were as opposed to the facts\nAll Eighteen sixty six was Austria Hungary last war before Nineteen fourteen and it was it was wasn't yet called Austria Hungary was the Austrian Empire and an Eighteen sixty six\nThe auction empire fought a war with pressure\nAnd with Italy it was called the ... and it was for control of the states have Germany and the states have Italy and Austria Austria was trying to defend its role in Italy a controlled the new show the port of Venice in the hinterland opt out to Verona\nAnd then it controlled the German confederation which was this league of thirty nine states created the Congress of Vienna and Eighteen Fifteen\nAnd it was controlled by a diet of princes so the king of section eight of the king of Prussia the king of area the Austrian temper but the Austrian ever was president of this German Confederation and this suited Austria perfectly uh gave the appearance of great prestige and power but it's crush 'em\nUnder came home the first phone call him and his brilliant a prime minister auto fun Bismarck really shaped this arrangement\nAnd so they push throughout the early Eighteen sixties for a war with Austria sodas to dissolve the German confederation to reform Germany under pressure rule which would eventually happen in these two wars of Eighteen sixty six and then the Franco ... war of Eighteen Seventy\nSimilarly in the south the the Italians were being organized by the kingdom of Piedmont who was trying to unify the entire peninsula that unified most of it in Eighteen sixty one\nUnder the under the leadership of the house the void the the ... dynasty and all that remain to them was a new show this Austrian held province in\nNorth eastern Italy and the papal states the city of Rome and the surrounding area a lot to do but also the papal marches and and parts that are hadn't yet been annexed by the kingdom of Italy\nSo Austria last that war so really the there you could say that Eighteenth sixty six was really the death knell because\nThey lost their ... role in Germany they lost their ... role in Italy they\nWere forced back onto their own territory the the the Austrian Empire\nBecause of all the internal Russians that went on during this last war of Eighteen sixty six\nThe emperor felt compelled to make an arrangement with the Hungarians where he divided the monarchy into two has the Austrian half of Hungarian half called Austria Hungary granted the Hungarians of parliament\nIn eastern Austria and and then there was the German parliament in western Austria and so really the ... the country was\nThe the the idea of the emperor's idea was that he was retrenching that he was shoring the empire of for the long haul after the defeat of making sixty six but what America's asked if he really talks about in the first third of the book is how this ... this great compromise of Eighteen sixty seven with the Hungarians\nRather than strengthening and retrenching you'd actually desperately weaken the monarchy because it\nCreated it exacerbated the nationality problems that had already been quite sharp before a team sixty six but they became much sharper after eating sixty six because of this compromise with the Hungarian basically eastern Austria the part that was taken over by the Hungarians as part of his great compromise debating sixty seven\nWas was Hungarians were actually in minority majority in eastern in eastern Austria to Syria called translate the any of the area east the life of river where slobs and remains\nAnd the Hungarians were you know about a little less than fifty percent over there and the and and the majority were slobs and Romanians and so the Hungarians ruled eastern Austria with an iron hand they insisted on Hungarian in schools\nAnd churches public office administration\nAre they in franchise only seven percent of the population you had to be a wealthy educated modular Hungarian in order to be elected to parliament or even to vote for deputies to parliament\nSo you had millions of slow vox

in this particular company\nI Believe Jim if they by the end of the story they've taken two hundred and fifty percent casualties and he's lost the majority of people he was in Quantico with so he is you repeat repeat throughout the story lucky Jim a lucky\nLucky cliff case there is no explanation for how he survived and everything around him ... because he was always exposing himself to enemy fire\nAnd he was under artillery fire constantly even when he wasn't on the front line\n... yeah he was standing away to assault or a German lines that a swat zone dot in the morning July night\nRight and let's go to a swat stone July nineteenth ... ten twenty three I Am according to your reporting this book is particular because there are lots of correspondence and lots of people who have given different points of view of these events\nUh and uh that's when ... got out there and issue the famous I Will hold how did you get them such and such a position where he was cut off with twenty other men are sending a message back I Will hold\nWhile the previous day they're gonna have to sell by the fifth regiment and the night than twenty third regiments on the south first division in the north\nThey were trying to slice through this huge German pocket that have developed above them are and I was a very successful attacks as you call the the turning point to World War one of\nThe next day they set the fix regiment into followed the tracks of the other seven division soldiers the problem was weight than the Germans had brought up reinforcements there were there was no cover it was yet another open field just open fields\nThey had a German artillery balloons spotting for the artillery and yet the the the ... the ban sweat forward and it lasted\nReally I mean it started about eight o'clock in the morning and it was pretty much\nOver at eight thirty in the morning I'm just going to advance a machine gun fire artillery they're sitting ducks\nThey were basically getting wiped out left and right and they went to ground I'm and basically spent the rest of the day or not I won't say cowering but just hiding a German planes came straight them it was a had been buried under dove opens a flying circus that was under the command arming during\nWas ripped off and have been killed on April I'm\nBill Gates you know typically German planes that come over and he'd fired with his ... brought one guy down\nOther soldiers had captured machine guns that they were using they were shooting planes as they came and nobody was brought one down anyway hates is worried that the Germans when a lunch counter attack so we went out and scout it around\nAnd then came back to little just more of a dip in the in the ground than anything and he said that they must message you know a completely cut off I have like twelve men from different companies with me or I Will hold you know just the the robot was just sort of like a he wasn't going anywhere yeah\nRight but is it part of part of the marine story this building a Dan Daly earlier his message you want to live forever and before that a ... retreat that we just got here all the messages were building to tell a story which was the original story we know it's so well now\nWe are ... you can forget that it's only a hundred years old this idea that the Marines are invincible the Germans come up with a name for them which means either hell hound or devil dogs and the Marines take to it right away that part of their spring\nOh yeah I mean the legend do the war or the legend was building I mean that that was really the birth of the modern Marine Corps war a first world war I'm like I said they had never fought in such large numbers before a regimen it was about three thousand men um\nAnd uh so yeah they they built the real a speed a core right and you know now it's gotten to the point where the gates would use the term soldiers forever and now you know Marines don't want him to call them soldiers Marines\nFor although you have that nice details that when they're officers especially at Quantico address them they call them laugh\nYeah right yeah yeah yeah it was like yeah there are ... up um\nHarbored the port a brigade commander noted that it was it wasn't like the army where it was real pecking order you had to stay in your place he thought that the Marines treated each other much more equally or go get a cup of coffee lab he's got a big so was it different style of discipline\n... throughout your life you know the the uh the conception of what rings are so hard\nThis is the last summer out of the war and the Germans are fighting ferociously so or the French and the British and now they're using the Americans to launch attacks\nHowever Persian wants to prepare his men in particular called the salient where which would be a ... and the line and we go through August with\nCase getting some rotation back to our and our they were thirty five miles from Paris so it wasn't hard to go to Paris one day participate in the parade and then be back in the front lines\nWithin twelve hours and you mostly watch we go now to the advance that person put together along the lines some ... ... it's called\nUh September eleventh and twelfth and the second division was assigned to advance on again across a terrain that was chewed up badly body it was\nAs you make the point Jim this terrain you could still see the trees and villages and fields that was not the case once they get to the Meuse Argonne which is where the battlefield had been for four years yeah\nRight there was actually uses that areas either as a rest area for a German troops um it had been severely fought over in Nineteen Fifteen and then both sides just said okay let's let it be but um it was interesting is that when the Americans first arrived they saw that as a perfect opportunity that this is like in Nineteen Seventeen that some day\nWhat what all American armies reduce debt ceiling and ultimate came it came to ... to pass as part of a bargain between person and spoke\nOf the commander I'm In return for doing assault a main assault with the Meuse Argonne so the Germans are actually pulling out of the same yell salient as Americans we're going in it was it was the probably the fewest casualties of any major battle that was fun that whole war\nAnd I'm case was involved the Ninety six companies
