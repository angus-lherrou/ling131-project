show I welcome Adam white and he teaches at ... law school at George Mason university is a\nFellow at the Hoover Institution riding most recently at the Weekly Standard about the cabin on hearing\nThe question raised these last days and now we're on the eve of the Senate final vote the outcome is not certain but there is a glide path to landing in the Republican saver out of a very good evening to you the inquiry you raise in your Weekly Standard piece\nSeveral days past still useful\nWas the judiciary process of these last sixty Seventy days was that a job interview as has been asserted or was that a search for the truth in a criminal allegation good evening to you\nWell good evening John it's it's always good to be back well I Will say if this was a job interview than it looks increasingly likely to be out of the interview is you're hired justice Kavanaugh\nThings seem to be very promising for the judge right now although of course things are always subject to change until the last moment well the reason why I wrote that article though for the Weekly Standard was\nA judge Kavanaugh's critics kept saying uh the Senate's process is not a criminal trial he doesn't get a presumption of innocence there was no burden of proof on his accuser it's just a job interview in which the interviewer\nI guess the Senate or can can decide however they want\nThe point in my article was that really was looking to narrowly at this the Senate is it's not just a job interview the Senate isn't some corporate HR department of the United States Senate as part of our government and its wielding sovereign power in a ... attempt to do justice\nAnd so I think that the Senate needed to take very careful steps through the process it constructed\nA to do justice to everybody involved but also to keep in mind that this won't be the last Supreme Court nomination that the Senate considers and the Senate needed to go about its work in this case taking care to set precedence that will allow the Senate to do its best possible job in the future\nSo it's not of course it's not a criminal trial it's not a court this isn't a judge or it's not a trial but it's not a job interview it's the Senate's process for advice and consent\nAnd the Senate needed to take that much more seriously than judge Kavanaugh's opponents would have had to do\nYou participated in the judiciary inquiring about judge Kavanaugh to being a member of the Supreme Court you've testified\nOr with other scholars and therefore you said in that room and you looked at the senators and there are aids and you saw the process which is a ceremony advice and consent\nThat process before the Feinstein introduction of the allegations the first allegations of lazy for an allegation and then there were subsequent allegations\nThat process is is that damaged and how long is that if it is how long will that damage last because I think you've thought before the damage and now we're on the other side of it\nWill John I testified on the last day of the original hearing last panel of the last day at that point even the protesters were getting bored and a lot of the senators weren't there are a lot of the staff weren't there I was there to testify on judge Kavanaugh's record in administrative\nLaw which you and I discussed shortly yes on the air shortly before the testimony and\nI think his record as exemplary but it is it seems like a thousand years ago that we were talking about the original hearings and even at that time the process was already coming apart you and I discussed on the air the things that senator Booker and others had done to tried to detonate the hearing\nA and it's very opening moments that flurry of interruptions objections and demands and on my panel last panel of the day of the last ... the hearings\nIt was largely dominated by the parents of John Dean the former Nixon White House counsel the Watergate figure\nWith a Democratic senators asking him with questions trying to compare Trump to Nixon and Watergate and so on and so the process was already degraded by the time we got to that last panel I think that a a Senator Grassley\nDeserves immense credit for holding it together as well as he could and then when they're came demands for further investigation further hearings I wrote that Weekly Standard article to say yes it's it's good\nTo this is good that we had these extra hearings but opening up more FBI investigations to chase allegations that senators had even before the original Senate hearing\nAnd that's the key to the doctor for brought these allegations to the Senate well before the hearing and the senator's Senator Feinstein others we're now trying to reopen the entire process after\nThe fact I thought that was very dangerous because I think if we allow too much of that to happen then in the next Supreme Court nomination the confirmation hearing we're all going to sit and sort of wait for the ...\nThe original hearings and so we can find out what the real goods are\nWhat the real allegations will be which will come out tactically after hearing and so I think that a Senator Grassley Senator Flake and the others\nI think they did a good job of reopening the hearing it allowing a very limited investigation but without allowing the entire process to devolve into a never ending fishing expedition\nIt has confused and disheartening to public Adam you know that your professional you look at it inside Europe you teach at a law school you will have young lawyers of the future but those of us who don't go to law school didn't aren't going to go to law school\nA this was easy to understand as a continuation of the twenty sixth campaign this is this was about the presidency or who won the presidency and twenty sixteen not about the judiciary branch of the government not about the Supreme Court it's a puzzle this this politicized the Supreme Court\nNow I understand the Supreme Court has a political flavor to what they read the headlines I get that but has something changed doors will we will we see this in this in the scheme of things as just more or to or they arguing point in the larger scale builds up to twenty twenty\nA lot of people a lot of judge Kavanaugh's critics have said that what we've just experienced will affect the courts legitimacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor producing in the first project and then on after that you're publicly traded company does\nThat mean people can purchase a a

in fact are the dominant force of wealth in America\nAnd so however they want to paint themselves however they want to talk\nAnd however they want to assemble they are the dominant force of wealth and this was true of the south of the the you know the confederation that would become the other side and the civil war the the confederacy\nI'm a blue ... de ... owns a almost everything and in fact in the Eighteen fifty is the the south\nAnd the institution of slavery had more money more wealth than every other elements in American Life all the railroads all of the manufacturing all of the financial instruments banks everything\nHousing real estate\nSome money that existed in human flesh\nWas greater than the sum of all the wealth that was not\nInvested in slavery and I think this was the basis\nFor the south deciding that it had to rebel and what you have today is an American elite that is in the same situation without control without any bridal whatsoever and they are\nThe force that is seeking to remake or to to drive in lead America and whatever agenda they troops\nIn other words the south was the aristocracy they had the breathing they had the fish and they have the money\nThey have this chivalry southern chivalry yes yes well but they had a fish and\nThat ... that dominated American Life and I must\nSay because this is absolutely essential\nThe south cannot be

or what kept the south alive as the dominant\nForce in American Life New York city with Confederate Michael we know that had voted against Lance twice yes and it was\nWay after of the civil war but the fact is\nNew York city and the south gather represent the nineteenth century American only if we look at the port per se but deplorable ...\nThey were young men they were the the hard Scrabble um

I Want to I Want to focus is now with his Eighteen fifty six years to go tragedy to go in between fifty six and the opening of the conflict\nAgain I remind myself and everyone you cannot know you're in a civil war when you're in it that's one of the mysteries here only afterwards you reflect on it we know now that Greeley was in a civil war it was a war of words but the attack on butler or the

will appear in a couple of weeks and the magazine the American conservative and it's it's about the proclivity of America to to fight and divide\nAnd to embrace civil war and one of the most important\nElements in the dynamic of American a division and American bitterness is the way in which elites go hammer and Tong at one another and I think it has to be said\nThat if you look at the first American civil war which we call quite wrongly the American revolution that the um the rebels were sexually not\nThe rich and Monday deletes compared to the British aristocracy and monarchy\nAnd if you look at the\nAh situation that I laid out a couple of minutes ago in terms of the disparity in wealth between the southern aristocracy Italy and the new rising Republican Party\nAnd here I Would suggest anybody who wants to understand\nWhat the Republican Party was in the Eighteen fifty should read William in apps a wonderful book\nUh the origins of the Republican Party and you will find out how much\nThe elite of that drove the civil war was not a an elite that had any comparable or aspect\nTo to the southern aristocracy and I think you see that day in the sense that yes there

Down forty two pounds\nMay make the call it changed my life and I'm sure it'll change your\nMind [noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show [noise]\n\nOoh\nI'm joined us on this is the John ...\nIs the is the small business report brought to you by the Republican ... uh as about genre is a prosperous nation looking to develop into the twenty first century with small business just as the United states is developing which is why the business of the planet is small business gene marks\nIs the small business columnist for the guardian newspaper and other distinguish publications in junior new column and the guardian looks very attractive so I immediately wanted to go to the question of minimum wage\nYou have written about it in the guardian most recently we've talked about minimum wage for the last year but it's been a debate in the United states especially around\nFast food franchises and\nExtending from the Pacific to the Atlantic city's you're debating whether minimum wage is can be imposed upon small business owners and what that does for\nEmployment statistics however we now have the breaking news that Amazon is raising its minimum wage and all of its of hundreds of thousands of employees to Fifteen dollars\nWhat was your first impression when Jeff Bezos made this announcement how did you how how did you think this would affect small businesses good evening to Eugene\nGrieving John up my first impression when Amazon or decided to raise their waste to Fifteen dollars I think they're sending a clear shot across the bow at all small businesses and merchants that they'd better step up their game that's what I thought now\nFirst of all there are a lot of reasons behind the scenes right Amazon raised their wages to what they are and people can debate that there's political reasons\nSome people you know they're they're actually cutting some benefit some ... plans and their bonus plans for some people are saying workers might be making a little bit less or Amazon disputes that claim or your Amazon themselves or their their automated near warehouses for this may not even be an issue\nGoing forward as they continue to cut down on employees but the bottom line is from a PR standpoint they're paying their people Fifteen bucks an hour which is more than other their competitors like Wal Mart or doing as well they're gonna have to respond\nAnd if you're a small merchant uh this is what you're up against when you're when you're trying to attract people I the reason why I like this is the lesser of two evils John is that I I don't like the government telling businesses what they should be paying their people I've always been\nNon supportive of a minimum wage I think that the federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents is\nUnrealistic anyway and I don't really know any any of my clients are paying a you know an hourly wage that low um I think it should be left up to you know the private sector\nAnd the private sector's doing that right Amazon right now saying it's we think Fifteen bucks an hour should be what it is\nSo I prefer to have that then the government requiring it but now small merchants and small businesses are hourly you know paying hourly they've got to respond to something like that and I wrote in the uh in the guardian recently how\nUm you know my my clients that complain the most John about I'm not being able to find good people um I look at that and see their numbers they tend to pay their people less you know they they're you know I just can't find a good person to work in the warehouse for ten dollars an hour\nOf the reason why is because down the street somebody's paying twelve bucks an hour to do it\nSo I Know I think we as business owners have to realize that you get what you pay for and we do have to pay a little bit more and maybe it doesn't have to be in the form of wages maybe it's more paid time off or more fringe benefits or\nBetter health insurance but the tight labor market and we're either gonna have to suck it up if we can or increased prices if we have to do that but\nYou know this is what's going on now and I think Amazon is that they are telling all small businesses by this move we better do something as well and step it up\nYou have a column and the guardian recovering the twenty Seventeen study by the University of Washington\nThat mitigate this rushed towards Fifteen dollars an hour if the ambition is more jobs now we're in a very tight job market right now actually the word tight as an adequate there are there not enough workers one of the one of the\nOne of the practical reasons for Amazon to raise the wages that they need a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty thousand for the holidays and they might not be there so but in any event gene ... things have not changed rather than the economics of minimum wage\nIt decreases the number of employees and limits the possibilities for a small business owners and franchises [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it's it's definitely a challenge for business owners to react now again there was a study from the University of Washington that said that it had an impact on employment in Seattle where their minimum wage went up to Thirteen dollars an hour\nBack in two thousand and sixteen but then another study just came out that at Berkeley which I Know you take it with a grain of salt joined us from Berkeley\nA protein ... they looked at a few cities that increase their minimum wages\nAbove ten dollars an hour Washington Chicago Seattle San Francisco and they\nThey said no it didn't have any impact on jobs over the years there's been plenty of studies\nThat that you contradict each other on the impact of what our minimum wage hurts job growth or not the bottom line is though is that you know it it's a competitive market and right now employees um I could have their say they didn't have to say ten years ago when the unemployment rate is so high\nBusinesses have to respond to that and we have to pay more if you want good people you gotta you gotta pay for them or you're going to lose out to companies like Amazon and you have to adjust and somewhat\n... costs are increase your price\nUnless the employee is a robot okay now let's examine the trend here too you know these are the you have a guardian column about cash was reached retail store what does that and what is the country for ... well\nThere are um first of all their their as Amazon itself\nUh it's it's been introducing cash flow stores around the country they just opened the third casual store in Chicago just recently where you go into the store and uh you know you can pay you know you buy your stuff you take it off the shelf you pay with the app and there's no cash that's involved is an automated store which is cutting down on employees\nLike really had after a million diet and exercise programs I just gave up figured I'm a big guy and that's that would have to call ... diet had my consultation with Dr ... and now if the forty days I'm Down forty two pounds may make the call it changed my life and I'm sure it'll change yours\nSally beauty knew all in one hair color kiss and make it easy to come to your hair at home [noise]\nEverything you need to live for the ... results\n[noise] left by professional open to everyone Sally beauty [noise]\n[noise]\nNo back to the John bachelor show\n[noise]\nI'm John bus or this is the John ... columnist for the guardian and this is a small business for more than a business of America is small business the business of the planet of small businesses has\nBrought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which in my visit I saw is an excellent capitalistic with lots of small businesses in all directions looking for more that the middle of Eurasia and the middle of North America together for small businesses and Jean\nThe economy is extremely strong can I say that again extremely strong we have deals in place now that are solving the terror of disputes with our allies that would be Canada and Mexico are allies the European Union Japan is in conversation however\nWhat I learned is to pay attention to the small business because that is the metrics that leads us you told me in the winter of sixteen\nUh watch out for Donald Trump small businesses love him they think they're going to get a big boost from him and I went what\nNow I pay attention again when small businesses are looking at this fabulous climate just fat the markets are up the ... the chairman of the Federal Reserve says things can get better so what does the small businesses make of this excitement\nUm met [laughter] okay maybe a little bit better than many people are happy that's good news um by clients I talked to a ... they're happy they're there\nThey're looking for employees that they are busy there certainly um you know you're pleased with the way the economy is going but\nInterestingly enough particularly with small businesses and I keep an eye on these guys the question is John if the if they're doing well should they be spending more shouldn't they be hiring more you know hiring it small businesses ease up but it hasn't\nBeen at the same level as big corporations and now a new survey a new report that just came out from Pepperdine University um is is actually saying that\nUh the financing among small businesses is is is lagging a little bit\nThis you know this report found out that I'm a third of the small businesses that they they surveyed with under five million in revenue only a third of them so that they plan to raise financing and the next six months\nForty three percent don't plan to raise any financing at all and twenty three percent aren't sure what they'll do\nWhich translates into the fact of small business owners themselves as strong as the economy is they're just still cautious we are a very cautious breed we still have the great recession and it's hard to believe it's like almost ten years ago but it's still\nSticking in our minds let's not forget that the average age of the small business owner in America is about fifty three years old so we're old enough to really remember that recession and before we extend ourselves too much or expand chew much um we're really not gonna gonna think very hard about doing that\nSo yes we're happy with the way things are going yes we're happy as the economy is growing but are we really getting the financing that we need every really spending on expansion um it's it's not happening at the pace that you would think it would be happening\nIs it how it cost is it helps us gene you have a color is a guardian that looks at the expected rise in health costs and twenty Nineteen right so people\nOr or or concern not only about employee cost and finding employees and meeting that demand but one of the biggest cost that we're all facing happens to be health costs yeah we've been looking at double digit\nHealthcare insurance increases over the past few years now the good news is that they're actually to report that just came out very recently one from a consulting firm called out all the her health\nThat found out that health care costs are really only expected to rise about four point one percent next year for employers in addition to that\nHealthcare costs as well um based on a Kaiser foundation study that just came out this week also predicts about five percent increase in five percent is like for healthcare so that's pretty good I mean you're right I mean we're used to a lot more than that\nBut even so the cost of a typical employee for health care is now up around twenty thousand dollars a year it's still significant and the demands for health care insurance are higher than ever and they need to provide that kind of benefit\nIs a priority if we want to attract good people so it's certain costs for that and keep an eye on retirement costs as well John which are also creeping up\nThese types of cost or people were as business owners were spending more on our people um and the costs to maintain them and keep them loyal unhappy than getting financing to go out and you know build new you know build new buildings or expand our businesses so I Do think yes that is one big factor that's going to get back\nTo things change first California is looking at a changing small business lending practices you regard this to the good\n[noise] I I I\nIt as I Can't believe it it it does now at ... ... a bill in California to legislate legislative build it it's it's pending to be signed into law will likely be signed into law\nWhich is requiring lenders to provide full disclosure now here's what the bill requires lenders it's let it part particularly on line lenders they have to tell you the total amount that you're that you're borrowing that that the cost of the financing that term\nHow often you have to pay what the pre payment policies are\nThese are kinda like standard things right I mean if you were going to get you know alone are these things you'd be asking for\nWell apparently there are a lot of small businesses in this country that get loans from online lenders that aren't getting that kind of information unfortunately and so the state legislature in California stepped in and said listen if you're going to be an online lender and land in California were requiring you to make sure that your your your clients your customers\nKnow this information that you are disclosing it all to them so I think it's a great thing for small businesses are but I Will tell you one thing if you're a business owner and you're not even asking these questions you better hire an accountant or an attorney to represent you\nKind of financing even from an online vendor because those people will be asking these questions regardless of whether the law requires them or not\nAnd Michigan a form association health\nPlans under federal rules is this a work around that is viable we've seen others rejected\nYeah we're talking about health care before so I I'm a big proponent of association health plans this is a ruling a that was issued by the department of labor it's under the Trump Administration that's one of the many things that the Trump Administration is doing so to circumvent the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd in Michigan there's now stories of companies that are forming associations\nSo you don't have to join your industry group although maybe your industry group offers them but you can form your own association and if you have more than a hundred employees that are part of his association you're like minded businesses or what not\nYou can negotiate better rates because the rules are under Obamacare are not a donor is if you have more than a hundred employees means that\nYou can cut out some essential health benefits and and and get lower premiums for yourself\nAnd your employees now some people might not be crazy about that but you can't exclude people with preexisting conditions and you can't charge people more\nBased on their health history association plans are great options offered to your employees along with whatever else you're you're currently offering just be where it's a Trump Administration thing John and\nYou know as we learn by executive orders they can be overturned by a quick this is not law today and tomorrow not get reelected these things can go right out the door\nJean Marc feeds the small business columnist for the guardian another distinguish publications this is the small business report brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which is filling

smart and long range standoff mind and what that means is instead of at the fifty too far away and you know laying a minefield a pattern back and forth over the deck right off the enemy shore\nIt can stand off forty or fifty miles and in one pass release a bunch of these mines with precision accuracy and lay and entire minefield\nThese mines are meant to deny access to a a whole region an ocean for example let's take an example to the south China Sea would be fifty two with these mines be able to deny the P L A navy access to those routes around the south China Sea\nWell yeah especially around it's a manmade islands but you've got that shallow water um do you know that ... mind works best ...\nSo I'll be fifty two or even potentially stealth bomber or be Twenty one up which is a comic or going to be to eventually\nCould fly near one of those islands inches of rain yet with these quick strike times without ever having to fight over it or fly low over the water can drop these from fifty thousand feet are higher in the case of the beach to the beach or you want which is very high point capability\nSo at the point at that point capital ships or cannot operate with any confidence whatsoever in a vast amount of ocean you've ... you write or you just put you put them out of action\nYes and you can also with this um lock ships it where they ... and that's a big part is that you know by taking a where the where are you know China has a large amount of their fleets like eight an island or whatever\nThis system you can literally layer of precision minefield look what pass the bill the night but B ... bomber and that all that combat power will be locked that island they can't leave until they eat mind that that harbor that area\nSo we're talking not just a week during the ability to better by call do I fear of what mine warfare is and that is definitely going to have a break from eyebrows at Beijing\nAnd this is for the be fifty two because the B. fifty two has such a lift capability that's why they're designing all these new weapons for it you can put on a library of your arsenal and and launch\nYes let's put it this way right now of what we know of the pie fifty two if I remember correctly has five hyper ... weapons systems being developed for it\nFive ... that's what we know that\nI'm so it it it is the air horses\nBomber truck of a weapons to talk of the future it's are caring big outside weapons long distances and delivering them a standoff ranges and to do this one of the other upgrades that I could not that that\nIs they want to make that outer pile on capable it's been a weapon of that when the thousand pound class\nSo that's a big big weapons okay um and that's something that would be like a like a hyper ... like your call 'em but even these quick strike by if can get his biggest two thousand pounds so instead of sending a fighter that can carry two of them\nYou can set of bothered that carry twenty four of them and lay in a choir Meyer killed in one shot\nThe beat fifty to the weapon to fear in the twenty first century who knew and the twentieth now we go to the air force has plans to expand their operations with new squadrons you will recall\nThat the air force and all the military services\nHave been a Garrett these last years because of Congress's inability to reach a budget that is no longer the case and what the air force one is striking a tie your reporting that they want to go from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six that's a lot of new aircraft um\nWhy what is it that they need what capability did they gain with that growth\nSo basically that plan has capability growth in every combat\nKind of it in a category ... they do so air force wants to grow the squad or number of space in fighter and bomber in ... fueling a lot and refueling um so it's pretty much everybody needs to get them wants to stay out of class which is totally unfounded\nNow there is no I yeah how it's going to happen\nBut the take away the airports to really try to describe attractive Congress because that's what the reality that there's not enough aircraft or combat hour period\nYou eat and addicts quiet man there yet alone if we gave it to really protracted even lower at ... or whatever so\nThat their chickens have come home to roost when it comes to the air audience ... hot bath for that or the Cold War and he has two thousand three we could not about Asian of Iraq\nWith air power to use that as like the fact that could be like ... we don't have it so this is a remedy that a big question is how are they going to say\nWell they'll pay for it out of necessity the same way they paid for the fleet after Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty one so let's go to what else the air force is either upgrading or needs to ... has has need for attention the beach to what is that ... what is the beach it it it really looks really cool what's it for\nThe beat you up with the beats he was America's stopped bomber you know it was built in Nineteen eighty nine is on his first bail and it's amazing to think of it you know it's a Thirty Years' old or soap operas been around for a while a racial for about Twenty years\nOr Twenty one years and it certainly is already on the horizon but they will America silver bullet or is it is the most capable air combat vehicle old are they can penetrate deep in the enemy air space we're out\nOf ... or ... and want that are ... ... ... ... ... or ... you could take out all at higher here Bill Bill with one of those\nAnd the beach too is operating now in the middle east or I remember reading about that have they rotated them out of the middle east out of out of the contract field I think is where I read about at once upon a time where I still their\nLittle no they're not out of the the two that generally a air or made basis um that they have operational support that there are some in Hawaii right now that are trying to do that uh that are actually in the wake island where if you only got really caught on which is all do but in the middle East that people it'd be\nA lot is riding the better one be the older the older strike aircraft or by yes\nSo it's there there's to be one which they operate now have been using against ISIS as I recall that back to that is based largely in the U.S and is now part of this ... geo strategic\nA maneuvering in the Pacific out of Hawaii the B. fifty two we've mentioned the grandfather of grandfathers and then there's a new strike bomb or they're they're developing for the for the future how soon as the future for the new strike bummer\nWell amazingly so uh I think that this aircraft is going to enter operational capability twenty twenty five\nWhich is really hard to believe 'em but they move very fast on it it uses a lot of existing technologies are those are not developing all the avionics at all the time it gets really expensive they're trying to use off the show technologies for and packaging that very still a cutting edge here\nSo the idea is that with all these costs and want to spend\nWhat six hundred million or coffee which sounds like a lot of money but it's not it but he talked about stealth bombers right adding to buy a lot of them instead of like the beach too which is a death spiral but it's only after the Cold War going on were built I'm only twenty exist today\nThe beach but what they're talking at least a hundred\nBut based on like this new book a plumber I'm ... goal but they have it we just discussed we could very well see that a Twenty one go to like a hundred and fifty\nOr even a hundred and Seventy you that because it's not just the longer it goes a hundred different things it's optional have ads as well ... ... ... it can be very upset about initiatives it can work as a quarterback ... air vehicles potentially\nBut it's not just the traditional bomber at a target fly home this thing could support a fleet in ways that really um there are still a bat\nI'm speaking with Tyler Rockaway he keeps a war zone at the drive with his colleagues and we're talking about the air force and its capabilities when we come back what

I. U. defense innovation unit bought it turns out\nIt is now charged by the new director to take on\nThe China monster Patrick a very good evening to you I practice routinely reporting on China and I use the word piracy just to make it a little more romantic\nBut it's my understanding that the Chinese pirates have taken all of the software and all of the patents for the hardware for these last decades is that going to stop have we got a way of stopping them given the new commander of the DIE you good evening to\nA good evening so it's an ongoing effort from that the U.S government is paying more and more attention to now ah the Trump Administration is attempting to\nModify aspects of a the a way that we make sure that other countries aren't transferring to much intellectual technical capital or to\nTheir shores primarily Chinese uh and the Chinese government and intellectual property that has a dual use values so could be used for commercial or civilian applications but also a military applications\nAnd part of the push for that uh was a paper that was called the Pentagon paper and its authored by a fellow who's going to be the new head of the aisle you his name is Michael Brown and he's a former Symantec CEO uh and it's a change in what this aspect to the Pentagon was supposed\nTo do it we stood up and two thousand Fifteen by former defense secretary Ash Carter and it was meant to be the Pentagon's liaison to Silicon Valley so it was up to bridge\nBoth the culture and the practical gap that exists between a Washington DC and Silicon Valley to help the defense department really grabbing harness all of the great innovation that was coming out of the American start up seeing so\nUh what they called nontraditional players is a little tiny companies that are getting big vc money that produce things for the consumer world\nThe Pentagon says I'm you know we're used to dealing with these big defense contractors that are great a building missiles and ships et cetera but we really want to harness this innovation\nUntil they stood up this off as a and it's had a couple of different heads\nBut Michael Brown the new head his kind of a whole rash on the edge right if you will is a as former a CEO of Symantec and now as the head of the new um he's very focused on\nA reaching out to folks in Silicon valley to help them understand a why they should uh be interested in working with the Pentagon but also to highlight a on Capitol Hill and and uh within the Pentagon the risks inherent in\nUh the increasing amount of Chinese investment in key sensitive technology areas or that also occupied the started seeing a for instance artificial intelligence\nSo it's a a difficult process of trying to get a handle on on on this because it's not one that has a single easy solution on the one hand you don't want to restrict a\nVenture capital money that these startups desperately need but that's something that the government is paying more attention to and figuring out how to do it are the most recently passed natural defense authorization act includes a provision to help the government change or how it\nUh determines what sort of a investments foreign companies and foreign countries like China and Chinese companies can make us start ups a but it's also an effort to you is to help again or the defense department's secure\nInnovative technology solutions from a non traditional players so ah not big uh\nA defense contractors and it's a real a pill bottle so it if you if you haven't looked at the paper which we were the first to actually publish the final version of it on defense one uh it it highlights uh some of the dangers that are\nAt very least many a growing number of people in the defense department or and also think tanks are are highlighting in terms of a supply chain compromise and other issues from the growing amount of of Chinese investment there\nAre but it's it's not an again to a problem that has an easy solution because it's free flow of capital is also kind of a thing that we're all about it's it's really a big part of America's branch\nTo the rest of the world and so a navigating this new space where a we're watching technology transfer to\nA potential future adversary what we today describe as they can pay a competing nation a competitor nation or it's not something that's easily fixed but that's something that ah the Pentagon's\nOutreach arm to Silicon Valley is going to be spending more time\nDoing three free points that you develop in your piece at defense won won\nThe v the industry in this country is throwing all this money on software meaning everybody's innovating out there to the Chinese are no longer according to his round there no longer copy cats\nThey're creative and three there several Manhattan projects or authored by China\nA command economy a which right now we do or not matching AI is one I Know about but there are several others that could be listed here so what does brown recommend what it what does he need to get ... to to make his job possible\nWell it it's a good point I he does\nHighlight the contrast between the way the Chinese government\nTakes a whole of government and kind of whole economy response to ambitious technological goals and ... them with big investments and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together into meet the commercial sector that the government to beg\nI'm John ... so this is the John ... knowledge and\nProgram that is funded and under way up north of Grumman it's called the ... it's the next Gen bomber but Patrick has a piece about what they want in that bomber is this the extra Patrick was always in the design especially that business about\nUpgrading its defense capabilities are they redesigning it ... as they go\nYeah that's the entire point is to make a a new\nStrategic bombers that uh is\nActually multiple strategic bombers that are involved as quickly as the ah threats that it's going to face and that's a contrast to the way the country used you designed a you know great big\nStrategic entities like this like a you know previous bombers going back to the beach too and and uh that would be one cetera uh before that\nAs well as a submarines and and ICBMs many of which have\nRemained unchanged basically for decades\nThe point was to have these uh and very exist to deter potential adversaries simply\nBy being in the ground being in the air and being in the sea and so as long as they could continue to deliver that capability you didn't have to change them that much against the static adversary but I'm\nOne of the things that the air force right now is recognizing a in what they want from uh the new bomber that they're developing and I think you might even see the the same sort of thing come into future language about uh ICBMs in in the navy begins to talk about it were when they replace a nuclear submarines um\nIs this sense that\nNew defenses against us bombers they're going to be more difficult and also change more rapidly than a perhaps the U.S is prepared for at least in terms of the way we used to design stuff and that's because of information technology right that's because ah can\nPutin or software based uh a radio radar um software based threat detection software based uh you know methods for attacking information systems that are part of aircraft\nThose things evolve at the speed of information technology which is much faster than the hardware of all uh and so what they want from this next strategic bomber is that it be a not only rapidly afraid of all but rapidly available in several key areas including defensive systems and so that speaks to the need for\nA a probably new forms of cognitive or electronic warfare capabilities and also a cognitive defensive capabilities which means\nThe ability a innate in terms of the software that's on the plane to detect new forms of radar detection that are being thrown at it and also to uh\nUh to execute new forms of offensive or electronic warfare weapons delivery and that's on top of caring whatever payload it needs to carry a but one of the things that they also are looking at is how this\nThing is going to operate alongside a bunch of other aircraft to create a sense of um\nUncertainty in in a potential adversary and that's that's also a big change from the way we used to think about nuclear deterrence right because the to go back to your doctor Strangelove those ah bombers are flying to\nSort of you know send a message or by the fighter jets sent a completely different message and now the the emphasis on creating a sense that hey you know with a\nI'm a long range strategic cruise missile a that is nuclear tipped it's possible to have a fighter jet that also serves in\nThe function of of a bomber um and that's something that they're talking about in in for a couple of years now they've been talking in an abstract way not in a formal way but in an abstract way about bringing some of that capability onto the thirty five\nPatrick how do you live lion was down there they're treating air frames like the way Tesla treats its automobiles they don't actually touched the machine they upgrade with software is that what they're thinking of here that it that the the air frame remains the same but its capabilities will change as they write new software\n[noise] um yeah basically that that that's not necessarily that this the capability will improve with as soon as you press a button or you might have to install something new but it can improve pretty quickly and do your point though\nWhen David goldfish in general they would go and he was the chief of staff Airforce talks about what he once and future air fringe actually does bring up exactly what you just described he actually brings up Tesla in remote updating of a core\nFunctioning of the ... of the systems on board by virtue of just you give them a new payload and all of a sudden you've got an entirely new way of\nThat aircraft interface with the pilots of communicating with a command and and really of accessing the world so that is something that they want to move towards this is remote updating of a lot of different aspects of the way these planes function in terms of uh they're sort of the court brains on board\nReturn and naturally just face act because space X right now is popular because it's building cheaper boosters first stage repeatable boosters that you can buy secondhand and third hand\nHowever now a debate emerges that I did not know about about space acts taking orders for weaponized space\nAs I understand it Patrick what's happened is that we're no longer debating should they be weaponized it is and it's going to be so the question is how are we going to respond is this a contract or in other words would add the Airforce be outsourcing its weaponized of space to go to space ex\nWell this was an interesting\nAnd I think sort of revealing moment that also occurred at the ah air forces recent conference when when ... well who are basically runs space acts on terms of the day to day operations there\nUh she's the president and and the c._e._o. or was asked if a space X would consider delivering weapons payloads into space and she said sure why not\nUm so it it gives a it's a it's nothing that's become a contract yet but it does speak to a what\nIs the next stage of of the U.S putting things into space and there's a lot of push a particularly from\nMichael Griffin who's the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to put a lot more sensors in space and also potentially deport direct energy which is blazers or a neutral particle beams or weapons\nIn space to attack missiles as they're launching during the ... this is something that he's talked about uh in terms of\nA potentially of great interest in an advantage to the United states so uh it's no longer so much of an abstract discussion at something that's becoming a a real discussion though not yet connected to a big change in policy where a lot of people are waiting for\nThe new missile defense review to come out to explain that but space exploration example of one of these new commercial private space players that's kind of seeing the writing on the wall in terms of the way one of the world's up probably world's largest space single space customer\nA is talking about what they want to do\nAnd and signaling that that's something that they're comfortable with but I you know even though you can say and I think that that certainly Defense Department folks do say that the weaponization of space as it\nIs a thing that is actively occurring that a Chinese anti satellite test which go back now more than eight years are very real and the the facts of them are are known to the entire world\nRussian a placement of\nA robotic entities in space that may serve an anti satellite functioned that's something that a more and more people are talking about and uh it's a matter of known intelligence at this point so you can say that the weaponization of space and something that's already happened the differences that China and Russia are yet acknowledging that that's something that they're doing\nWhereas the U.S policy seems to be a we're going to at some point announced the possibility of intentional\nPlacement of objects in space or which means that I don't know in many ways it sort of the worst of both worlds there kind of late to the game but they're the first one to take all the heat for it because there is a lot of concern internationally about whether or not that's something that the international space treaty would support\nPatrick Tucker the technology editor of dissent swan I specially recommend the defense innovation unit paper that Patrick is made possible through

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nFinding cloudy on Bob around the stories are we talking about on Seventy seven WABC\nCity health department wants to know why at least eight more people in Washington Heights have been sickened by legionnaires disease you get the story from W ABC's Robin Dawson\nCity council by Mark LeVine is telling his people in the neighborhood to really keep track of how they're feeling not tough\nAnd I'm Talking galaxies like maybe one and you see two fifty three and tourists a drama the gal city all live in the same plane and the local voice above that played and pushes us down and so it's very important to our movement through the universe which is very fat\nOkay now if I if I picture there's a there's some logic to this all of the galaxies and ... you mentioned Andromeda which is great galaxy and large male model in a cloud small natural in a cloud we're all close to we're all gathered around like as a like a team effort here\nAnd we're all on the same play oddly but gravity might work that magical way\nAnd then at once you step away especially I'm not above us that doesn't work\nBut once you go above the plane there's nothing ... does that describe what we observed for other voids that they have a cluster of galaxies and then there's nothing around it as if it's gathered all the ... the dust it's available for a quarter of a billion light years well\nThere is indeed very little in the local boy\nSo what you go above the local sheets of which we are a park right you will be in nearly complete darkness and they're very few ... you know and this is indeed what we think happens in another voice too but the nice thing about the local boy does because it's still nearby starting just four million light years away\nWe're able to rule out the existence of even fairly faint galaxies at at such this\nDo do we take all of its dust can is that a with a product of all the dust gathered in the local boy\nI think the way to view this is that over time over billions of years the galaxies attract what another through the gravity and the galaxy cluster right and the groups they attract other galaxies into their residences shall we say and the voids\nExpand as a result and so you can look at what's going on as galaxy clusters and full of us pulling in additional galaxies through the gravity you could also look at it as a void victims there galaxies as the filament attract\nThose avoid galaxies toward it so probably the reason that the local she is so very fit it simply because the local voice has pushed those galaxies has squeezed those galaxies into that sheet\nBetween a that local void and and the void on the other side of us so it's it's really a wonderful opportunity to ... to study what are these gigantic conflict structures because local void is still very\nNearby you write your your report in the sky telescope that the Milky Way us a little pd peace in one of the artist the Milky Way we're going through the University of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second which is fast okay one point for a million miles per hour is that because of the local boy does it make us go that fast\nYes it is part of the reason that we're going very fast and let me first put that number in perspective six hundred and thirty kilometers per second which as you correctly say it's one point four million miles per hour that's really fast\nOkay if you compare that much faster than we are going around the stuff I mean there are schools around the sun it only thirty kilometers for second and the sun goes around the center of the Milky Way galaxy only two hundred and fifty kilometers per second so here we are\nThe entire local group of galaxies that the Milky Way and the drama to Cal State where an all the other galaxies in the local group we're all moving through the University of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second much faster than we go around the sun will go around the galaxy\nAnd the question is why well it must be because there are huge cosmic structures out there that are trying to pull us their way or perhaps push us away of a local void is one of these things but first let me talk about two other\nObjects that are a very important to our most one of them as the Virgo clusters of galaxies dislocated fifty four million light years from earth it's the nearest galaxy cluster to us\nAnd it's trying to pull us its way through its gravity also at a greater distance there's something called the great a tractor which is an even more massive clusters of galaxies at it too is trying to pull off its way in a different direction\nAnd then you've got the local boy which is what you asked about now voids don't try to push ups and ... don't try to pull off their way because there's very little matter in a void instead you can think of the local boy as trying to push us\nAllies so the polls from the vertical after and the greatest tractor and the big push from the local boy explain ... through the University of very high speed of six hundred and thirty coauthor it's protected so yes we do need to include\nThe influence of the local avoid as we try to understand that very high

they using on curiosity is actually the backup computer\nBecause shortly after it landed on Mars the primary computer started have problems hardware and software issues and so they switched it back up\nThey have a ... over the over time they have diagnosed the primary computer they're not using it but they've ... they've diagnosed it figured out where the bad memory was so that they think they can use it again and that's now crucial here because the backup computer that they using\nThe sending limited engineering data right now it from a short term memory it tells us the rovers in good shape curiosity but they can't figure out why you cannot store and then download upload actually science data\nAnd his long term memory and the way the ... the the backup computers function they can't even get 'em uh the adventure records what's been going on to try to diagnose what the problem is so what the engineers who decided to do is to switch back to the first computer\nThe one that gave him trouble five years ago\nAnd use that to try to get a record of what happened so they can diagnose the problem on the backup computer they've been using for the last five years\nThis carries a little bit of risk because the old computer did have problems they say they've diagnosed it and they know that they have isolated the bad um sections on the memory that they don't want to use but you know this carry some risk\nIn the meantime Gary ... is not against any debt or it's not broken it's not doing anything it's been sitting now for more than two weeks without being able to give us any

response from it now since mid June\nUm they're hoping they think what's happened is that the it's a it's full of panels have been covered with dust so he can't get enough energy even though there's no much stalled and they're hoping that a dust devils go by and blow the dust off that has happened to the past\nBut they're not getting the response yet so we don't know what this means is for the

announcements of their confidence with a restoring\nCuriosity and opportunity well that announcement to always you know\nWe are right on his dad but you read between the lines especially on curiosity\nA ... right now they are very careful they optimistic and I think that their optimism is it realistic because they have the back ups\nAnd they understand what's happening and they have communications with the rover and it's working so I think that their optimism and curiosity is is is realistic but there is a risk\nWith opportunity they basically stated where we are uh if if those solar panels are covered and they're not getting any energy they're not going to hear from it until those pounds get cleared and it could very well be months in another month or two because November is the ... the season\nAnd so they're they're they're anticipating the more likely dust devils hit\nAfter November and so we'll just have to wait for that it's very possible cure a opportunity is dead
