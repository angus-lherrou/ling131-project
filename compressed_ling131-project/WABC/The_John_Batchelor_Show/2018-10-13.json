really having developed global brands whether that be an apple or Coca Cola or other that there's a tremendous opportunity to engage these consumers coming into the middle class and really becoming first world consumers in terms of\nInfluencing their behavior influencing their choice and you have these huge numbers of people that are now looking to make\nBrand decisions and decide where they wish to spend their money and how they wish to spend their money and it really is kind of a new era for marketing companies for technology companies to help that customer connect with the brand of experience that they wish to\nThe business model we used in the United states is the private enterprise translates into taxes that are\nMade available to the government either the state local or the federal government to pay for the security and and and welfare of the population that's the way it would work in every country but we're going to concentrate almost entirely on how the U.S work why\nBecause of the top twenty brands only six of them are not us based we dominate the world in branding conversation with Chris just referred to\nSo Chris this requires an information a burst of information is social media right now capable of providing that information about these consumers what they want where they're going what what their dreams are\nYes great question I think that the the social media aspects to a certain extent might be starting to pull back a little bit\nThere's the ongoing discussion in the U.S in\nA the you especially with GDP are in the regulatory environment the Europeans are putting forward where that smartphone that you carry on your hip while an amazingly functional device is also being used to harvest data around you the consumer in I'm\nIn a business model like a Google using Android\nSoftware or you're not necessarily the consumer your the product\nThe amount of money generated and you can see Google's market cap in the bottom line by\nPulling information on that consumer selling that information to branches is amazing slash scary at times but I think what you'll see is\nThat mobile device has been one of the key indicators and the the market is moving a little bit from the customer being the provider of all that data to the customer more opting in and building those circles building those engagements that they wish because there is a tremendous amount of what we'd call at\nFatigue in the world you might have fifty apps on your phone but you really use the same four or five for the majority of the time spent how do you better reach that consumer an environment where the consumer does not feel like you're spying are stepping on their privacy but you also wished to influence their decisions and try to guide them down a path\nWell the old fashioned way would have been you looked at the bottom line each quarter about how much you sold and where you sold what is the new fashioned way how does it work for us\n[noise] I think that the new fashioned way is really what can you do to convert a customer's whether it be intent whether it be a thoughts towards a brand no longer is it simply a I win you lose where if I as a customer decide to ...\nThat I'm going to have that customer from now till the end of time\nRoughly forty to forty seven forty percent of customers will go into a retail store for their first purchase but once they've done that first purchase and I know the quality or the capability of that product and I'm happy are satisfied with that product\nThen why wouldn't necessarily go to that retail store again I can simply have Amazon shipped out and shop on my door at no cost and with a hundred million users of Amazon Prime in the U.S alone today that's a real factor or threats to the physical based retailers of them becoming show rooms for completion by the directs dollars\nI think that the capability or the requirement is for\nA brand day retailer in this dialogue with customers to give that customer reason to continue to engage in continue that relevance and to be of service to the cost of an ongoing basis if you're not if you're not engaging in driving a deeper relationship than the opportunity for that relationship to be lost is very high\nI read in the economist that this challenge of how to ... how to have a conversation with your customer going forward\nIs also true for the millennials the new generation that have according to the economists reporting a profile but it's very different from the Gen x ers or my generation the boomers\nAre for example they're hesitant about long term commitments and therefore the large car companies are moving towards a subscription base for an automobile rather than making a big financial\nOr a big financial commitment over time thirty six months or five years or something like that so within branding is a is a dialogue that's going on now with the consumers who will be dominant in the year twenty thirty I mean the rich people in the United states\nIt you're exactly right it every Twenty years plus or minus each significant generation is going to dictate the way that they want a bland to interact with them\nAnd they vote with their dollars which is why it's such an interesting thing that they will choose the brands they'll choose the relationships that they wish increasingly with the millennials is\nDifferent from Gen extra baby boomers\nTheir technology natives they did not grow up in an environment where smart phones or tablets or interactive a TV\nDid not exist so they're they're native to technology and in many cases where a millennial or a baby boomer would consider hey there's not an associate on a sales for to help me an extra would say I really don't want someone bothering at one to be able to use technology to embrace the technology because I find this to be the way\nIt was to communicate and the voting with the dollars is ultimately what you see in many of the\nRise of certain retailers the fall of others that those retailers those brands are listening to their consumers and you can react you're never going to force a customer to a particular path that they're not aligned with whether that's a North American shop or whether that's a an Indian or a Chinese shopper\nThey'll gravitate to what they're most comfortable with\nRight now according to Brookings a three point eight million people who qualify for middle class right now that's going to grow according to Brookings in the next twelve years the five point three my mathematics says that's a more than fifty percent almost sixty percent increase so\nThe fact is that growth is going to come in ... in Asia which is why I mentioned that that nine out of ten of the next middle class people the people who come into the middle class for consumption are in Eurasia I read in the wall Street Journal that there will be a big expo in China coming up\nA is China the epicenter of that next nine of that ... billion or is it spread out in many cities in you raise your Chris\n[noise] you know it's a great question I think that the China is certainly a very very big factor but never discount the growth that India and never discount where India will overtake China in terms of population\nA little bit more in the areas of rule of law a little bit more with English or understanding and tradition as it were I think that the big three being China India and then Malaysia Indonesia as a combined area\nThose are probably the three points out the triangle\nThe difference being how\nThose different brands ... I'm sure there's different cultures understand and react you branding in\nShanghai and many of the main Chinese cities that are extremely accommodating for western brands you'll see Chinese consumers where there may be knock off brands for sale they want to buy the original item they want to ... and they want to buy the Nike sneakers because they believe in brand\nAs much themselves and understand the quality that that can days in that relationship\nYes according to the underground network but I'm looking at the top growing brands right now everywhere in the world in the solar system our Amazon and Facebook COO surprise right and that means that they're all headed to Eurasia Chris regal is a C.

in Eighteen fifty grand compromise that was reached\nBut in both those situations the the um\nArtifact that had been created and embrace that was supposed to solve everything and creative future of amity\nWas in fact quite the opposite so that uh the repeal stamp act had no impact or in that\nBritish Parliament was more and more determined to find some other path\nIn which to force their authority on the colonies and in the Eighteen fifties the passage of the fugitive slave act the renewed intense far more um\nPrescriptive and punishing fugitive slave act of Eighteen fifty\nA that slave act led directly to a gigantic backlash in the north which in itself led to the kinds of confrontations later and\nThe cave that lead to civil war now what's important here is the fact that it is not simply the reaction of people to to all of this that leads to a the possibility of of a confrontation and the civil war\nThis proclivity that is unleashed by a a an incendiary\nAction or a decision is inflamed typically by the leadership whatever the leadership is and the colonies and the Eighteenth century or in both the American south and in the newly emerging Republican north\nIn the Eighteen fifties there is a a an annoying amount of um a a a ... of the need to become radical\nThat's exactly what we saw from Mrs Clinton at CNN and Eric Holder and in in temperate remark I Believe he was video the ... there's a video going everywhere talking about kicking Republicans those are celebrity leaders of the Democratic party Michael\nAre they ... are they the barn burners are are they are they are they the are they the the Tea Party of a Boston Harbor\nWhat we have today or is not a kind of mutual set a fire browns\nBut at the moment and this is because I think of the defeat of a blue and the Kavanaugh hearings what we have is a powerful push a by blue to\nUm try and Marshall their forces and to give them permission dispensation if you will to be violent and this is a\nUm a kind of top down up permission\nThat is a ... exactly what happened in the period leading up to the American\n... let's look at the twist here Michael these two perpetrators at the men at the metropolitan Republican club\nThey have a document here that condemns everybody in America what the Democrats are not at this point speaking to is that they're on leasing the whirlwind this isn't just republic Democrats take action against Republicans this is saying anarchists go ahead\nAnd that's a way of of unleashing our photos Michael I mentioned China because that's a super state but\nNow I have to be very clear here but this is what happened after the passage of the more intense fugitive slave act of Eighteen fifty\nThe rhetorical response of people like Charles Sumner and we talked about is gaining a less we Eighteen fifty six yes in the in his\nIn tents and passionate rhetoric over the top rhetoric helped to unleash with out of the doubt\nThe ah terrorist actions of someone like John Brown in Kansas and on the other side of the Confederate um the emerging Confederate reaction but what we have here is\nSomething extremely similar in the sense that they well\nAh the legitimate and ... and almost authorized the the the well wasn't raised\nA authorities of of democratic leadership have\nGone out on a limb and consciously and deliberately sanctioned a move toward violent behavior and this is part and parcel of the curve the upward curve of escalation toward a civil war\nWhen I Want to I Want us to be just a moment when we come back I Want to turn to to have

[noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show way\n[noise]\nI'm John Donvan and this is the John ... show it's a pleasure to welcome Luke ... who is the director of the Douglas and Sarah Alison Center for foreign policy at\nThe Heritage Foundation just returned from the Caspian Sea bass and I talk about it a deal I'm keen on looks observations I was there in July and August and the heat of the summer and there was great news anticipated\nThe signing of an agreement for the state of the Caspian Sea bass and just share energy pipelines future development on the great Silk Road\nLook good evening to you and thank you for joining your back from the Caspian Sea bass and there was anticipation of success you been there since are they celebrating our they disappointed what is the word and back to about the working together with their neighbors good evening to you\nThanks John and good evening and thanks for having me on that just came back from a as by John I was in Baku and also in noxious Irvine which is a separate region of Azerbaijan a boat for very fascinating place to visit I've been to about ... number of times\nBefore but you're right this was the first time I've been since the agreements in August\nAnd then John people are very optimistic and excited about the agreement I think that most of the countries around the Caspian are happy with the agreement other than Iran\nAnd I thought was interesting or looking at some of the reaction of social media many Iranians felt like the President Rouhani\nOf Iran betrayed uh the country and betrayed the people over the agreement because rainy and see themselves as having this a historical legacy of the Caspian region and they feel they should get\nMore ownership of the Caspian than what they are getting out of this deal but nevertheless putting aside or on the concerns of the concerns of your average Iranian which let's face it they have a lot of other problems right now\nPutting those to one side this agreement does offer a lot of potential to bring new oil and gas resources from the heart of Central Asia and the Caspian base and to\nEurope and many of America's allies in Europe\nYes this is the southern gas court or and uh I've tried to do I've described it to the audience Luke and I want your help to it say\nIt's a connection from the ... the natural gas the there are two platforms developing but also from Turkmenistan also from Kazakhstan through Azerbaijan and then through the ... guy through Georgia\nTo turkey and then across turkey through the Balkans including Bulgaria into Greece under the tire rainy and see and all the way to Italy so we're talking about not just the riches of the Caspian Sea bass and are we talking about energy security for Europe that's how I saw the possibility Luke how do you ...\nYeah absolutely the you know the ultimate goal was southern gas court orders to allow Europeans to get gas from places other than Russia or Iran\nAs so we're we're talking about right right now is in terms of like practical deliveries of natural gas to Europe using the southern grass court or we're talking about really either by John\nBend the future because of this Caspian agreement we could see this expand out to Kazakhstan and also Turkmenistan because they're on the other side of the Caspian\nAnd there's been this debate over the years on building a pipeline connecting the west eastern side of the Caspian Sea where you have Turkmenistan for example with the western side where you have either by John\nAnd the reason why a pipeline is required is because I like oil or natural gas uh it's very expensive to ship\nA by by by boat you have to liquefy it Ellen gee you've heard that term I'm sure many of your listeners have\nIf they have to liquid liquefied natural gas\nSo it's only profitable to do that when you're when you're traveling more than let's say a two thousand miles or so whereas the distance between the two coast so the Caspian we're talking only about three hundred three hundred and twenty miles so into a pipeline has constructed is not profitable to move this gas\nTo Europe through the Caspian\nBut in Tel the agreement an August or a pipeline was unable to be constructed because there was no legal framework to do so and now there is so there's a lot of optimism about Europe able to get new sources of\nOf ah of gas or to diversify where they get their energy from away from Russia and the more from other resources\nAnd many of your listeners can be thinking well how does this impact me in a in the United states and that's actually a very simple because\nMany of our European allies in NATO for example we're obligated to protect or through the NATO or the north Atlantic treaty and it's in our benefits that they have security and energy independence away from Russia because that gives Russia one less lever that they can\nPool to apply pressure on many of our allies\nYou mentioned Iran and it's unclear where that is headed but it certainly is a rough neighborhood Azerbaijan lives and I want to just to attend a moment to Georgia because this pipeline goes through Georgia and George gets these from it also gets energy from it Georgia is a threatened stage\nOf the south caucuses it was pulled apart and the two thousand innate invasion by the Russians has not been put back together and I see the court or or at least this agreement in the Caspian Sea\nAs one additional way to backup what's left of the jokes\nAnd governance is that a fair generalization look you study this area very carefully\nWell absolutely that's a that's a very important point that is actually often overlook to Georgia is a very important trends that country and what the Georgians what is as much energy\nTransiting their country go to Europe is possible that only because you know from an economic point of view Georgia would get transit fees they they are able to get a certain amount of gas and oil from ... because of the transit\nFees and the the transit rights but they know that the ... the the more oil and gas transits Georgia to get to Europe and and to get to the international markets means that there's more international concern and focus on Georgia and as you pointed out Georgia's already\nCongratulations for your work since we first talked I've been doing a deal of reading and it's left me behind but I'm Glad to have the language\nWhat it is an ass and a spirit called nucleic acid and how does that answer a mystery about how to keep the body from rejecting therapies could evening today\nOther John thanks for having me it's a pleasure to be here presenting a on behalf of the exit your team\nI'm sort of spiritual nucleic acid um is a three dimensional arrangement of DNA orange day um and we look at it a little bit like a ... where we arrange the DNA on the outside of an anti particle\nAnd ... is really a convergence of lots of different technologies and tools and information that we've gathered as a community and the science space for the last ten years\nOf the idea being that you can arrange DNA or an AA into these circle nucleic acid structures and when you make the ... structures we now have a way to introduce genetic material into cells and into tissues throughout the body\nIntroduce it in a way that it won't be rejected that's right introduce it in a way that it doesn't have toxic side effects that are damaging to other healthy parts of the body\nThat's correct yeah the idea here is um the code if you will inside of the cell is the DNA and we want to find ways to get our own code to go inside shell or inside the tissues in the body and here to for that's been a challenge of and so editing a DNA or inside the body isn't something that\nHas been a real I'm hurt a hurdle for the field to get over a will be create the circle nucleic acid what we do is we create a system that is a little bit of a Trojan Horse\nThat allows the DNA or to get inside of self allows us to now start correcting faulty DNA\nOr in some cases like cancer or putting in kill switches so that we can actually genetically target cancers and are able to get rid of the cells that have a particular gene of interest or that may be leading to a\nCell that we know one of the body like a cancer so this is generally called immunotherapy\nImmunotherapy is a one way to use a DNA productively inside the body\nImmunotherapy space right now is as you mentioned it to your intro very hot topic this year actually very hot topic absolutely a Noble Prize just went out a few weeks ago for some of the developers in the pathways for me to therapies a gym Allison and us to go home Joe\nShared a Nobel Prize for this idea that you could use the body's own immune system to fight cancer and in fact there are drugs that are now on the market that are helping patients with cancer use of their own immune system to fight off a cancer causing cells\nBrain I GI track lungs skin there's the list goes on about where this is useful their cells all over the body that can go awry and you have a way of treating the cells without being rejected\nDoes the S. N. A. does it sustain itself the body will attack something from the outside eventually does it a road or does it ... it does it stay with us\nAs you mentioned we kept busy it actually care we're developing drugs and many different therapeutic areas I'm In some of the first therapies in these areas that are genetically targeted so the idea is to go after the underlying genetic causes of disease\nAnd sure enough if you correct the genetic defects that are inside the cell um you can create sustained medicines and the ones that are actually heading towards cures where we've created a way to modify the underlying disease source\nAnd we're not really just talking about treatments anymore but we're really talking about opportunities for us to correct mistakes or inside the code itself\nUp for um diseases and all different types of organs\nThere's a video to several videos at a company or a website and the emphasis is on three dimensional why is that important David three dimensional approach\nIs one of the discoveries that we made that was the basis of execution was bad cells and tissues don't like two dimensional linear DNA origami that's floating around in fact your body's evolves to try to get rid of the DNA in our day I'm over evolutionary time\nAnd that's been a huge challenge in the field for the last Thirty years because people have always looked at two dimensional structures and tried to puzzle over how to get those into the right cells and tissues\nWhy the three dimensional sphere ... structure is so important was the discovery that we made at Northwestern university it's part of my PHD work in a a laboratory of a gentleman named Chad Merck and and what I discovered in the working group was that when you create these three dimensional structures now this is a key that the cells recognize\nThe cells like the three dimensional structures and now are able to take that DNA into the cells productively where we're able to make genetically defined medicines\nWe have an FDA Europe has enough to Asia as if everybody has FDA's where are you in the process of getting this to market to the physicians in our FDA process\nSure so you're correct there's different jurisdictions all over the world right we're currently working on clinical trials in the u._k. and Germany and in the U.S\nAt ... going to run our first us face trial in the middle therapy space using our spiritual nucleic acid and we're anticipating starting that trial in patients with cancer before the end of the year I'm sort of the end of this year probably twenty Eighteen or expectations that we're going to be injecting the first patients with our you know therapies\nAnd how long is the process if you are successful I mean you're learning from this I understand I'm not presuming success right away but how long is the process for the FDA\nLong process to get through the stages of clinical trial success along the way so we're starting with a phase one be to trial or we just announced last week successful completion of a phase one trial\nUm after you get through the phase two trial you have faced three trials and then out into the market\nWas process can take a meet us several years to do one fun part about making DNA based medicine as the front end as much faster so we can sit at a computer we can design and medicine and we can get into patients to test it out to see if they can work much faster than traditionally done indeed a development space for drugs\nOur conversation David you gave me a vision of the future vision of the twenty first century you use the word design you can see an individual's DNA and respond to it is that where we are going in that it's up slowly so\nPension that we had the idea of DNA and structure of DNA soul since the Nineteen fifties\nAnd two thousand and three we declared success on sequencing the human genome and that tells me how your DNA John is different than my DNA\nAnd what at the individual nuclear base level the A's the g's and T's and sees underline the fundamental aspects of life or different between you and me in different between a disease state and a non disease state because we had that code book now in front of us we can actually sit at a computer\nWe can type in the code of the medicine that we want to make and I can design a drug that will work and your cells and will not work in my cells\nAnd so we're at the point now where we got the toad and we've got the tools we now have the spiritual nucleic acid which we think will allow us to make designer precision medicines that will impact lots of different\nArea or one person wanted to and already jewels get one person comes with an affliction or is diagnosed with an affliction and you respond for that person or that family I guess it would be similarities and\nThat's the vision for the future right now what are the areas that we're focusing on his genetically find disease needs oftentimes are inherited diseases that pass through generations of families\nA spinal muscular atrophy is one of the ones that were working on these severe disease that affects a motor function and children and that's an ... an inherited disease that's genetically based\nBut you can sit and you can look at that type of um changing the DNA for the different patients and you can see how one patient is different than another patient\nAnd my vision is that Twenty years from now you're going to be able to walk into your doctor's office and walk out with a medicine that specifically designed to go after your faulty DNA switch from inside the so\nDavid Gale Johan is the guy for X secure is the company\nIs traded on the stock exchange X e you are it's not hard to find to biotechnology but I've I've used a little bit

I'm I'm actually the um\nA lot of them look like little monitor ships like from the civil war went a little gun turrets on them and they would uh um it was a salt patrol boats\nAnd they were tied up next to or attached to or in this construction around a west coast so you actually have a city of people and and and uh and warships around you\nThat that's correct we also had a over a hundred and fifty US Army soldiers stationed aboard who would go out on these PBR as a as a ... you know you know called the duty\nLet's be details about this because teachers made available to me a history of this it was a hundred and Seventy five soldiers nineteenth century divisions third battalion thirty fourth artillery\nAs well as the crews of the Navy's river solved division plus the crew of West coast okay you're in trouble theater you're in trouble\nAnd you're an officer to take charge but you've lost all lights and you have to put together a shift to write it how is it that you solve the fact that the ship is thinking at this moment\nWell LS tease by that\nBarry nature had balloting tanks so that they could ah go up onto the shore\nFortunately we haven't lost all power and uh uh although a lot of the senior petty officers who are either killed or injured\nThere was one petty officer who went to his damage control station which was on the ballot the trip where there was a a pumping a facility to deep ballast the star but like\nA dog ... ballast tank\nAnd when the damage control system the officer or a God in communication with among the sound palette phones told them what to do they the ballast to the tanks and the the ship at one point in time cap and balance bill that we were going over\nA but fortunately they were able to be balanced so that as much water that was coming into the um ship from the um\nOpening from the damage from the buying the mining there\nWas as much water going out through the emptying the ballots thanks\nSo it's like you meant the ... century and ah the captain Aubrey was in charge I'm thinking of Patrick O'Brian series that already what say everybody on the pumps you're going to work twenty four hours [laughter]\nThat's that's about it now the ... river is a is a title river right it goes up and down in that it it is titled river are you at high tide or low tide at this point\nYou know I I don't recall I there wasn't a lot of title a variation or in the ... river at that time\nSo what we have now is the ship is not going to say but they think that and at this area of Vietnam is always going to be vulnerable to follow up attack so at this you don't know if there's going to be more mind you\nHave no idea if they're gonna be more mind we have no idea what's going on\nA bus you got injured crew everywhere we now moved to a chief Solomon who is he and where is he\nWell he actually with a with a motive to cheap cheap you received a silver star for his performance and saving is a crew members\nHe was actually a in his compartment the first class petty officer compartment with just one of the compartments was damaged and the mind and basically the deck of the um\nCompartment was blown up to within a less than a foot of the overhead the ceiling and he was able to um\nYou know climb out he was near the the the ladder to get out but there are other people in there that weren't so fortunate and or the other people in the other compartments who also trap\nHe rather than a\nBelieve is compartment immediately started doing a first aid and to all the people that was still in the compartment who was still alive\nDidn't have a bad injury his name was ... he was he was\nBadly injured and bleeding and um you know he just kept down at the new is due to the great thing about the uh call man in the navy the you know they know what their duty is and they perform at a heroically\nBut it's dark down there people have to get to him and meanwhile you're ... you're fighting that you're trying to right the ship so I take you back this is the young Peter Law where are you at this moment in the first half hour of the crisis first\nHalf hour I'm In a combat information sided with just behind the bridge I'm you know sending out messages and receiving the information that we can um and just waiting to see what happens\nSo what we have here is a situation that could deteriorated any moment you got you the ship is no longer stinking but it's still dark dawn is then what about an hour about an hour about an hour you don't have like you have you establish did you have emergency power that you could go to\nWe did get some emergency power on and get some lighting on but not in all of the ship and not on the part of the ship that had the sustained the damage\nThere are crews working through to rescue what they can because the internal part of the ship it's been torn apart by this bomb so when we come back let's rescue the west coast but there is a part to uh to the crisis of beginning November first Nineteen

Fifteen dollars after all you establish the fact that minimum wage is not about growth good evening to your job\nHey John I think what he's tablets does what he's always known\nThat poorly paid workers are incredibly expensive or the media have focused on hourly wages at Amazon but that's never been the principal or the the sole way they've they've compensated their workers all the way down to warehouse workers an hourly workers you arrive and you are awarded\nTo shares and then you are able to gain a new share every year\nAnd that's what they're doing is that they are um ending that form of compensation hourly wages plus shares and there'll still be higher hourly wages plus there will be a share of buying plan that they will Institute for all their employers they unemployed they want everyone there\nTo have skin in the game\nOr Amazon would not have three hundred thousand plus employees if it didn't pay its employees well it just does so differently and so ... says inside is that he's going to pay more and then also figure out a way to get them shares in the company\nPay more also you consider that Bezos has his eye on Washington how does the Fifteen dollars help him deal with are very very powerful state\nWell this is the unfortunate part I my sense and I can't prove this I'm merely speculate is the is the basis looks back to what happened to Bill Gates Bill Gates didn't have quote a man in Washington and he paid for it\nDearly with a wasteful lawsuit foisted on him by the department of justice and so my sense is that\nIs it based those fears that he fears\nThe success of Amazon getting him in trouble in in Washington and so\nThere's also the political aspect of it I don't think this is ... for a second I find it offensive when people say described as great businessmen as a crony I think he also did this to kind of signal to Washington look at me I'm doing these things that you want a instituting a higher minimum wage that's going to force other business to do it\nUm I think he would have done it any way but I think there is that fear\nBecause Bezos is often in the news because we're watching him he said global businessman he's looking out\nAnd the future for Amazon I I think the anecdote is that they're they now have warehouses I think it might be in Hong Kong but I'm not sure where there are very few employees I remember the number four and because they're mostly going to what we can call robots\nHow how does Fifteen dollar minimum wage fit into the world that Amazon is going to which is to automate as much as possible\n[noise] well actually it doesn't it at all but it doesn't not in a way that most people think pesos doesn't want low wage employees\nAs any businessman nose blow wage employees are expensive he wants higher\nPaid employees and so ideally the scenario would be to automate\nThat would be the reward that would enable him to grow the business even more and attract workers\nThat would command even higher wages for being much more productive than this is important to be as some people said in response to ... decision that he was just calling for a Fifteen dollar wage as a way of putting out of business is less automated competitors\nAll the more realistic assertion is is the basis wouldn't have time to focus on them and this scenario all businesses want to automate all businesses would want to automate whether the minimum wage was zero or whether it's Fifteen simply because when you can\nAutomate employee functions you can pay your workers a lot more and when you can pay your workers a lot more than ... you're able to do that because they're more productive they're less likely to leave\nIt cannot be stressed enough that low wage workers are very expensive no business would go out of its way to grow with them\nIs Jeff Bezos of crony\nHe's the opposite of a crony I think that he what needs to be stressed is that because Amazon is so large because it's so valuable successful he has to worry about Washington in the ... in ways that a small business does not and so it I don't begrudge\nHim the need to occasionally thrilled bone to Washington to say oh I'm for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage he's not foolish he knows that this can be a barrier to employment for some people\nBut he has to police masters who don't care that he's a great businessmen and precisely because his great businessmen wants to cut them down to size so he must needlessly\nAnd and unfortunately play the Washington game on occasion\nI Know John in Europe parentheses in your column you mentioned that if that was interested in cutting down the number of workers he must pay he wouldn't have bought whole foods that you you just said that labor intensive is an understatement good heavens\nWhy isn't that true he's doing this as he's starting to add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods\nJeep [noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show something anyway [noise]\nThe employment for Americans right now is Rosie but we can do more than that we can analyze why it has lots of room\n... here was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors this is two thousand sixty two thousand nine he's now professor at Stanford University's graduate school of business he's a fellow at the Hoover Institution riding most recently of the wall Street Journal about America's economy\nHad a very good evening to you there is the concern that ah that as the employment number just tens and we are now under four percent that there's trouble I had I think sometimes it's called inflation sometimes it's called overheating however you lay out numbers that are very convincing to me\nAbout the employment to population ratio that tells us the right now that American Jobs will just get better and better in the foreseeable future what is the employment to population ratio called the E. P. O. P. good evening to you and\nGood evening a well that's a standard measure that the economists particularly labor economists like to use\nUh the typical number that people are familiar with of course is the unemployment rate\nThe employment rate isn't quite the opposite of the unemployment rate but it's close to the opposite end it's the it's again the metric that economists prefer we actually prefer uh employment rather than unemployment so let me just tell you what that is here's here's how you want to think about it take the\nTotal number of people working that's essentially the number of people who have jobs and divide that by the number of people who could have jobs now when I say could have jobs the way that the bureau of Labor Statistics defines\nThat is I'm a in a particularly grand way and that is anybody sixteen and over could have a job so Ninety year old could have a job\nSomeone who's in school and high school could have a job so what that means is that the employment rate is never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a\nSignificant fraction of retirees it's never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a significant fraction and school but the number that we tend to see is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty one sixty two percent and in the last a recovery at the peak back in two thousand seven\nThe employment rate reached sixty three and a half percent uh and that was about as high as it got for a while and then it started to go back down as we hit the recession so the question is where will it go\nAnd where does it need to be in order to in order for us to be at full employment and just in in a one sentence the answer is sixty one percent it's right now about sixty and a half percent so we have about another half a percentage point to go\nThat means that there's growth they had and that translates into lots of jobs but I learned from you also\nThat it really matters this idea of full employment that really matters having to do with the Federal Reserve and everybody watching a ... are the people who who follow I think it's called the Phillips curb are they aware that we have room to grow on is that is that reflected in the feds remarks\nWell they are this is a debate that has been going on inside the fed and actually with me I've been in touch with a lot of fed officials\nAre about these issues for a couple of years now and you know to be honest that everybody was on my side I think that history has actually proven me correct because a couple of years ago\nI remember the unemployment rate it just you know sunk below five percent everybody said wow you know things are great where it's full employment and I said we've got a a long way to go and again it was because I was looking at the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate and a couple of other indicators as well\nBut based on those I said we're gonna we're gonna continue to grow or going to continue to see rapid job growth for another couple of years and in fact that's what happened so the fed is certainly aware of this but the reason this is relevant and as you just pointed out is particularly relevant\nBecause the fed is concerned that uh we may be overheating and they're trying to get ahead of the curve and in order to do that of course they've been raising interest rates and uh uh as we know that's a cause some volatility on the stock market over the past couple of days\nThe White House the Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow they're ... they're watching these numbers as well\nHave they got a persuasive case given these I mean there are some surprising demographic numbers now and I've never seen before the lowest unemployment for some of the most vulnerable populations in a generation maybe two generations is that ... is that significant for growth\nOh it is it is absolutely I mean it's it's significant in two respects first of all it's a measure of where we've been so it's a measure of growth it's a measure of our success\nA but the other thing it tells us is where we can be going and ... for that I Would say you always want to focus on the prime age workers and particularly in the last couple of years\nAnd those workers who are between twenty five and thirty for your years of age and mostly men actually in that group ... mostly men because the women have been doing fine but the men have not\nAnd recently if you look at the past few months what's happened is the employment rate among those among that group of twenty five to thirty four year old has picked up and picked up dramatically\nSo that's good news for a couple of reasons first of all those are people who we'd like to see back in the labor force of the ones who should be working\nBut second it also tells us that there is demand out there for people there are jobs available and when those jobs become available people will fill those jobs so again another indicator that the economy is continuing to expand\nWage growth that is also an indicator to watch how does that translate because there's been a complaint especially by partisans in the Democratic party that the wages in not growing means that this is a rich man's economy and not for everyone what does wage growth tell us about overheating and about ...\nRight okay well you know you raised a couple of points one is that the distribution of the wage growth who's getting the wages and who's not that's one issue but I I'm going to speak about your second one because that's the one that really it's more closely to your earlier a issue about whether the fed should be concerned about this\nWhat the fed worries about is that wages are growing more rapidly than they would be\nPermissible and permissible is kind of a funny word but they have a rule\nAnd their role is look at the rate of wage growth and compare that to the summer of two things one productivity growth\nAnd second inflation targeting inflation so we know that the Fed's target inflation rate is about two percent they'd like to see about ... percent inflation in the economy they think if you're below that that's not good they didn't give your above that that's not good\nLike ... percent in addition to that they are quite happy if wages grow by the rate of productivity and and the reason is that if you're producing more out but\nIt's going into the economy if wages are growing at that same rate that's not inflationary because the output is there to cover those wages so what that says is that if you look at the numbers for the ... year\nOr the fed would allow us to have wage growth that about three point three percent that's the some of the two percent plus the productivity increased\nOver the past couple of years actually asking here it's been two point eight percent so we're still below that which we have room in terms of wage growth forward in a situation where the fed worry is that if there is overheating in terms of ... ... ... it's sometimes called wage pressure cos push inflation\nAs well as the air was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors two thousand six to

S. S. and for plans going forward what do we know now about what happened and what is the state of the rock costs most ... program good evening to\nGood even in John well okay what we now there have been tentative um ... reports coming out of Russia\nThat suggest the problem occurred when the strap on suicide boosters up the first day separated it appears there is a valve that's supposed to open\nTo [noise]\nTo release adored done ... oxygen and I suspect also that action helps push the side a ... a strap on ... way and for some reason that valve did not open\nAnd it appears they think there was a collision of crying when those first those\nThose are strap on separated all maybe a ... a collision occurring when they first and second stage is separated and the cost stage in the middle separates lightly after the strap bonds released this is somewhat pulmonary we don't know yet they picked up some debris of the first stage\nThey're still looking into it they've opened a criminal investigation this is very Russian um but in this case considering that we had a\nSomeone drilling a hold and uh so use capsule there before it was launched than at hiding it\nI don't blame the Russians here for being a little bit paranoid even if this is the culture um the status for I assessed down the road as interesting job the Soyuz capsule have a two hundred day lives and in space\nAnd so when a crew goes up on it's a a saw use that capsule should be used to return within two hundred days which swarm all but seven months\nUm eight months something like that well the crew that's up there now there's three people up there\nThey were going to come down in December because that's when this or use a capsules warranty runs out\nWell right now the Russians have said they're not going to launch a manned mission until they launched at least one on land so or use first to make sure everything's okay um [noise] but these guys have to come back in December that's where there are two runs out on this or use lifeboat\nSo what I think it's probably going to happen here is that the December flight they're going to try to figure out what went wrong and get it fixed and do the December launch\n'em a without anyone on board and what that with all due is that will give them a new life both that can give them two hundred extra days that way I assessed will not have to be left\nOn now they've put an unmanned craft up to par cat I asked that\nYes exactly and me the craft that they're now they stuff with stuff why not you can take advantage of this stuff back and they'll just send it back on its own\nUm [laughter] I don't know often that that's probably the grass it's got the hole in it so there's another reason maybe not to put people on it\nUm and so uh this actually might work out very well it's not great for the crew onboard because they're basically going to have to extend their mission and um I've been told by it costs nothing astronaut\nTo take long missions like the shooting you know how long emissions supposed to be and you kind of pace yourself to do that mission now suddenly you have to extend it it's hard but they can do it and so that's where we stand it might be that this will be\nAnd uh that would be the first time in Eighteen years that no humans who were in space is pretty impressive situation um there'll be a tragedy lose that string I was really hoping that the Newman's would be in space for the rest of our human history [noise] um but that might not be the case I as a self they say can\nBe manned in space operated in space for that anybody on board with a by mission control but there's maintenance questions involved for example the to ask them if they were going to be on the show use craft one of the they were trained to do certain space walks to do maintenance on the station\nWell they're not there and the Russians have said they're going to launch these same two guys in April because they got to get them up there to do those maintenance space walks this also might impact the investigation and they only because they were saying they were going to do an during one of those space walks they were going to expect from the outside the whole uh\nAnd so this is a complicated situation will shift to see how it plays out in the future\nBob I'm going to press on this because you know there was talk of a criminal investigation has dropped or is that still under\nThe vi V. or the science the engineering investigation\nOf the panel that's doing that has also opened a criminal investigation rush or as I mentioned uh the Russians\n... that's not unusual for them to open criminal investigations this kind of thing they have a different attitude than we do but considering the fact that they had what looked like might've been sabotaged on the Soyuz capsule it's an altered right now\nAnd considering this has happened and considering they have so many problems they've had they've had six failures of soy use\nVariations the Saudis rocket and the last two years for oh I'm Sorry for failures\nBut either way that's a lot and so uh they're paranoid right now and even those cultural event normally somewhat power line the Russians you know the whole statement just because your parent it does not mean somebody has an hour to\nGet you and it could be very well the case here that there is there could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering or crews that build these things because they don't get paid much effect that paid a pittance compared to engineers the rest\nOf the world and the management is not great and detectives generally been poor and so Russia's really happy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal ...", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show",
