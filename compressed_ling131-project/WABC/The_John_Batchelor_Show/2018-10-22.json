{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "I Do everything on line so and jade diet dot com only twenty seven dollars right now as a radio list are normally Ninety nine dollars for right now twenty seven dollars is a radio listener\nAnd that'll get you an appointment with us\nWith one of one of the doctors and one of a certified health and wellness coaches will go over everything with you do the body composition analysis\nI Will do all those different things and and take a look at a visceral fat rating water levels muscle ... levels fat levels metabolic age scenarios are also will look at the obviously you're waiting and body fat percentage and all those types of things so\nYou know ... visceral fat so important to look at\nIf that visceral fat as high then that can be a reason not only why you have some of the health issues that you're having because that's linked to the diabetes heart disease cancer all those things that when nobody wants to even think about a but also it slows down your metabolism because it makes your insulin more disrupted which ... which affects\nHow your body is able to uh metabolize sugar as soon as those sugars aren't burned for energy your body is no other choice but to turn it into fat and store it\nSo we have to take a look at that as well so all these different things that we're looking at to personalize the situation for every single person and and and and get them the results that do you need you want\nI almost forgot like what time of year it was now it it really almost um you know past me that\nUm you know if you get started now you're you're going to be all set for the holidays so we're now this is one of the um this is one of our busiest times of the year for for many different reasons you know people start to layer their clothes and then they realize they have to go on vacation you know lower winter break and they either have to put on a bathing suit or they have to put on a ski outfit\nAnd you know here's the deal you get benefits on both sides right you put on a bathing suit you're the new you you put on a ski outfit here then you you too because I knew yes what you have a lot more energy going down the slopes you feel a lot better you're breathing better and\nYou know if you start now where we I we do we have forty days before the holidays we had for it we we've got four days before the holidays you know you haven't seen some of your families you know this is a funny time of year for us because what starts to happen\nAs you know we've got this huge influx of patience right before the holidays and then right after the holidays what we have happening as all of their relatives and all of their friends that saw them during the holidays just how I found my cousin my aunt my uncle or whatever they lost all this weight so now I'm here so\nIt's a very interesting dynamic of what happens in the next couple of months with our practices that um\n[noise] do you see some of the you know if you will the guinea pigs coming in and his whole family follows along\nAnd you know we actually had um a very interesting at thing we had a patient come in and he and he's doing his second round the first time around I think he lost um thirty five pounds I think he wanted to lose another Fifteen or twenty so he's only doing a shorter period he's not doing a full forty days\nBut he said to us he said there's anybody ever complain to guys that it hurts to say when you lose all that weight\nAnd so I thought it was kind of funny in law was put off his ... yeah yeah\nThat well that's the thing where you don't even think about that right when you're sitting you're sitting on you know quite a bit of salt and adding and wherever it is the Adams says if there's some muscle there he said I didn't realize that he's like my heart's like I understand what's hurting he's like\nI said to him I was I guess as they get up and get more active and you know I'm you know this is actually somebody who doesn't fit a lot he's it extremely active human being but I guess you started realizing he doesn't have as much padding over there anymore but that'll do it right oh he's like down almost sixty pounds\nAnd the total not sixty he's a little bit over fifty pounds but you know and the total of his weight loss he now started to feel well he should have been feeling like four years right here in his heart\nAnd the well yeah I ... is the muscles are all very sad but I just thought it was such a funny thing to say like this is kind of what's interesting right when you're talking to all of our patients some of the things that are no lead there's less padding on the last ... exactly exactly\nAnd you know you see a lot of uh what's also I'm kind of an interesting dynamic as someone who is very fat and who does work out on a regular basis and comes to us to lose that whatever twenty or thirty pounds and they need to lose\nAnd what's interesting is that you start to see their a muscle mass and you actually physically see their arms surely see that definition laying there under fat\nRight uh because we have so many of those patients that do work out on a regular basis we've actually had such a huge number of personal trainers that come in to do our program right because just like\nA you know a regular person unfortunately they come to the point where they don't understand why they're putting on weight and so once we get them into fat burning it's quite amazing because then they really start to look shredded I mean you see all that muscle and all that work that they've done over the years it's still there doesn't go anyway\nNo script and the results what's great about this was the results are so fast like I mean people don't believe you know you're you're losing twenty five to fifty pounds and forty days that's what we typically see with men and women so the results are tremendous you guys are coming in women within the first week your people come in they go how fast you're going to see results are in the ...\nSaid by the first time you're right and we have people come in within like around ten days after they start to program by your ten day visit women are down anywhere from eight to twelve pounds men are down anywhere from ten to Fifteen pounds and when they say that to them they can look at me sideways I go absolutely that's what we see here that's actually what we see and when people are coming in\nThey're losing fat they're not losing the water the water is improving because of the personalization of the supplement the water levels are actually increasing in the body\nAnd it's not only a matter of getting people to drink more water with a lot of times we have to people have people lower their water consumption 'cause they're drinking so much but their minerals that are out of bounds so their body isn't absorbing it properly which ones are slowing down the metabolism\nAnd so we we we have them kind of keep it around a certain number depending on where where they are and that's individualized also but that's what the thing so like Tom\nComes in it's sixty five year old guy he comes in this week\nFifteen pounds he's down in in twelve days I mean right it's great\nSo he he came in you know we did the ... we did the uh the heritage alive it affects meant the about what the by energetic type thing we did the blood work is that's meant he needed it seems a long standing skin issues\nAnd marine alluded to that you were talking about that earlier about you know who the skin detoxify minutes we're largest or again after he got liver support\nThat's one of the main supplements he had it's usually a liver toxicity when it comes out on the skin like that and so you you know skins improving already\nThis is to less than two weeks in\nFrom severe skin issues for a long period of time to the charity improving now\nAh and down the Fifteen pounds and twelve days I mean it's it's a tremendous tremendous number and we're not talking about twenty five year old guy here it's sixty five year old guy\nAnd so this is these are the these are the types of things that we really see a show one eight five five five and Jay diet is the number is the number to call here uh and so you know you're going to come in we're into the body composition analysis\nOr we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey or New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well or if you call one eight five five five hundred diet that's where I go over in the office a of the program and at no charge right so you can do that and a twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight\nA and we're going explain to you without shots hormones surgery know hunger how you're going to lose weight\nFast how are you going to lose it where you want to lose it because that's why people store in different areas of because the body's protecting those areas because the different hormonal imbalances how the program it's going to balance your your your hormones\nA detox to find themselves the Oregon the tissues almost everybody in the first week says the same thing I have more energy I'm sleeping better and more energy I'm sleeping better uh\nAnd so that's where we're going to expect for you to twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we typically see in forty days thirty five to forty five to ... pounds\nFor men is what we typically see in forty days and so you can either do the phone call you can also the best way in my opinion is you go on line you go to and Jay diet dot com or and normally it's Ninety nine dollars for the first visit\nA as a radio listener only twenty seven dollars gets you an appointment to the office where you're going to come in and we're going to take a look at it not just your way we'll explain the program to you and the personalization of it\nBut we'll also take a look at a body count will do a body composition announces with your\nWhere we're going to take a look at your weight your body fat percentage uh your body water level you're visceral fat rating so important to take a look at metabolic age so if your metabolic rate if you're burning let's say if you're a guy burning Eighteen hundred calories a day\nBut your body's functioning like you're taking in three thousand calories a day you are not going to be able to lose weight you're gonna oh twelve hundred calories at the end of the day so like I said very important\nAnd Jake guy sat com only twenty seven dollars right now is a radio listener you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five three for three H ... n J died dot com have a phenomenal day everybody take care had a great afternoon [noise]\n\nListening to the new\nLaw system [noise]\nAnd the perspective I Want to give you is so okay so we know that a discrimination causes pain and we know that spinal ... doses causes pain but what causes discrimination and what causes the spinal ... says well I'm going to posit to you that\nA key contributing factor to the uh to development of those conditions is um unhealthy ligaments in the back\nAnd the unhealthy ligaments are occur from a gradual wear and tear where the ligaments gets stretch beyond their capacity and over time as those ligaments weaken\nThe spine is less stable\nAnd I don't mean less stable on a um where are the whole spine is falling apart but there's more play in the between the bones of the spine when I say more play like they're not they're not being held together in a smooth motion and so when\nThere's a lack city of the ligaments\nOkay that puts a strain on the desks and that puts the pressure on the joints in the spy so when it puts pressure on the desks that's where you get a discrimination and eventually wear and tear of the desk\nAnd as the wear and tear develops then despite the bones get closer together and then the spinal canal narrows and that's what spinal ... this is all about and the key thing to understand is what caused that and the first place is loose ligaments and so what's a great treatment\n... what we need to do is find a treatment that strengthens those ligaments so they're not lose like that\nAnd a great treatment for that is prologue therapy so by strengthening the ligaments it basically stabilizes the spine and first of all the ligaments themselves can be a source of pain and so by strengthening them they're not going to be as painful\nAnd secondly once the ... the spinal structures are stabilize that's less pressure on the desk that's less pressure on the joints\nSo all of a sudden the pain is starting to decrease not just for short term but for long term and again that's what ... that's what makes pro therapies such a great treatment for spinal conditions and\nEspecially lumbar conditions are for the treatment of discriminations for spinal ... says\nAnd even we talked about oh I'm having spasm in my back muscles fast moving back well why is your muscle tightening up like that it's tightening up because it feels that the muscles feel they need to do that work because the ligaments aren't holding things structurally or with the right structural support that\nYou too and when they're not do giving their proper structural support the muscles react by tightening up around it so all that muscle pain that you get in the back\nA lot of that is because of loose ligaments and the best way to strengthen those ligaments are relieved that pain\nIs with pro will therapy so once you strengthen the ligaments we promo therapy than the paint the muscles don't have to work as hard they're not getting into that spasm mode and the pain starts to improve so this is Dr Warren sleigh ten I'm at the general feeling center right in the heart of Ridgewood New Jersey\nAnd you can check out my Web site\nAt N. J. prologue dot com\nAnd if you'd like to talk to me here at the studio you can reach me at eight hundred a for eight WABC eight hundred eight for eight nine to two two and you can also um call me a at my office at two o one a day to Fifteen hundred after the show\nI work again check out my YouTube channel the gender of healing show so again um I Want to uh we're talking about polls therapy for the neck and back\nToday and we have\nOn the or not we have a caller here on the line we have Joe from Princeton New Jersey Joe\nI'm the reason I'm calling is I kinda look at a shoe issue with my back for years when I was heavier I couldn't even stand up straight for a while but now I'm I'm Seventy two years old I'm In good shape [noise]\nUm I Do a lot of dancing a lot of exercise but every once in a while if I turn if I turn the wrong way on my right side\nI just for ... for my hope\nMy back my whole backside\nNot walk back side of above my fought\nIn the lower back just a [noise] gives me a lot of pain all of a sudden or a ... I'm I'm worried that eventually be crippled from I'm not sure what's going on\nHow often is that happening Joe\nIt happens if I ... if I bend over to the right side if I went over to the right side and pick up some weight that's when it happens\nWell I mean that definitely has the feel for kind of what I'm Talking about where\nUm there is some um lack sitting your spine and many times that laxity is from loose ligaments\nAnd so it it may just be a simple matter strengthening those ligaments and to give you that increased feeling of stability\nAnd a reducing that pain that that movement is causing so it it sounds like some people I can tell you that some people have widespread ligament injury and it sounds like yours it sounds like a few ligaments or just uh when they were stressed in that certain way I'm are causing your muscles to have to tighten up and that's that\nFeeling like wants to bring you down to the floor so that definitely again I I'd have to evaluate you of course to a really a confirmed that but that that's a that's the feel that it has\n[noise] and then some sounds like an exercise you're talking about\n... therapy that that's a good question so pro therapy\nIs a a procedure um it's basically to get the solution where it needs to go it's injections and we uh have ways of numbing up the area to make the injections as pain free as possible\nUm and uh that really um makes it a very tolerable procedure and are by doing that um we're able to get the solution where needs to be a which is right by the ligaments in your spine and um that that's what that's what we'll give you the relief in the long term benefit\nI see him and what is it that you're you're injecting\nIt saved extra it's dextrose uh I also use um I'm kind of not totally unique but what makes my parole of therapy or that much more special as I used vitamin B. twelve which enhanced his reaction\nAnd I also use ozone ah which is a enrich oxygen that also improves the metabolic benefit of the a polo therapy so\nOkay I'll Try 'cause you're yeah you're talking about um oh what is it begins with a C I take it every day I Can't remember the name of it I'm like college and I take along\nOkay so pro therapy helps lay down to college in where needs to be so that that's a very good a complement to what we're doing with the ... therapy Joe so much alright so Joe listen I Want to talk to you more about your situation\nSo uh if you give Bruce ah ah your number I Would certainly uh give you a call after the show and we'll talk more okay All right thank you okay Joe and so hold on for Bruce and he'll he'll get a who get your information so we can talk further\nSo I'm\nSo again or the ... therapy is such a great adjunct 'em to so many other treatments you'll physical therapy is great um and you know that strengthens the muscle but to get to the core of the problem the ligaments\nAh you really need something to get in there or to really strengthen those ligaments and lead to long term benefits so pro therapy are definitely a helps achieve that\nSo I'm another type of problem that I like to uh talk about um I talked about the deaths have talked a little bit about spinal ... says I'm is\nKind of a pinched nerve and again a pinched nerve can happen both with the discrimination response to know says and uh but again when you think pinched nerve in the back when you have to realize is that there is some lack city up top\n... or some um\nIntrinsic instability that creates the a situation where the structure start to pressure the nerve and when those structures start to pressure the nerve that's when you get that um that type of pain\nOr that causes that um the pain down the leg because if it's a puts pressure on the nerve that's where that's where the nerve goes to the leg so by adding polo therapy to the to the area\nUm and strengthen the ligaments then it's not going to have that laxity that that loose and this and so the ligaments or stronger and all of a sudden or the pain starts to improve and the situation gets better but it was really great about furloughs therapies it's a long term solution\nOkay it's not it's not like taking a pill and it's not like oh it's better today and then it's bad again the next day it's long term relief because you're strengthening the structures in the spine\nAnd the way you're strengthening the structures is with pro of therapy so it's a great way to treat both short term and uh to relieve the pain and long term\nAnd a lotta times that paint on the lake can even be referred by the ligaments which is really interesting\nOverall um health again short term and long term and that's what's really so great about it or I met\nThe gender of healing center right in the heart of Richard New Jersey you can reach

musical chairs aims before a beauty [laughter]\nThere you go [laughter] so uh we have a lot of stuff to get to tonight we wanted to get into some a cool Facebook Messenger stuff we wanted to get into a reviews\nWe have I think some horror stories a digital marketing horror stories you want it to a dive into [noise] so uh what you eat get into first should we get into the um the messenger ads in\nThe er the AI or that we've been doing that kind of a I Would say maybe a little more cutting edge or advanced\nDo it ... what are you guys take for like a it's like I said I feel like I just got like a bulletin chests like mom I don't know me I didn't hear back [laughter] ... crashed what do you think any suggestions Zantac maybe something who knows pep so they see\nNo evidence sponsor will find some way lives in my ... All right I'm going and when I'm going to battle you sure you want to talk about these messenger as it seems to be having a a an effect on you and good I mean I'm good I just\nUh [noise] wow yeah\nSo yeah the cool thing is is are these um it is different all different ways to interact with people these days obviously there's the traditional phone call there's a contact form there's text messaging there is a little uh you know chat\nA ... a features that come up on your website a but a really effective way to reach out to your potential audience a way that you know is most likely you know close to a hundred percent not a hundred percent but close to it\nAh that's actually going to get opened and looked at and read is through Facebook Messenger\nWell messaging ... tax act if there was a messaging and the other I mean I I use Facebook but messaging systems that are out there\nToo but think about how many um Facebook Messenger messages you get a as opposed to text while I don't know how I mean he doesn't really\nI I don't get a lot right because a lot about all day I I don't get a tiny like\nThe young and they do the younger ones that's that's how they're doing or other communications\nAnd you see now even with I don't have that many but you could imagine I get I get ads now on my messenger among you know that instant messenger thing and and through text and getting you know as as well burn I said you know I'm ... but it is but\nWhat would\nThe what's happening like in retail and what's changing is and I saw this out an ad we conference that my son in law hosted\nA there's a specific um [noise] topic which was\nCreating\nRelationships with retail establishment and consumers out there and using that platform messaging as a way to get a one on one relationship with the customer and actually be able to shop and ... and buy online through messaging\nAnd having the one on one relationship it it is where companies are headed towards or you're not going to even end up on their website for purchasing you're going to end up through instant messaging and through taxing whatever purchasing and\nHe he had mentioned the side of people go on line to the fore women can go online to support through messaging\nAnd actually try on the makeup before they even buy it sort of technology or that you can go there and\nOne of the biggest expense is with the commerce companies just returned is returns so they're looking at technologies you're able to use to see what that jak river sure those parents look like on you so when you buy him it could it will alleviate\nA certain percentage of returns which is tremendously to the bottom line it's just the new way that where people are looking for now the big companies are already focused on this but it's even easier for smaller companies to do a one to one texting program with consumers mhm\nYeah which is kinda the way where and I don't go that were like really high up there I don't know if people that are driving down the street right now or even understanding what we're talking\nAbout what we're talking about having a conversation with the consumer automatically ... through text messaging\nSo what you're saying is that most of us have Facebook Facebook I guess automatically also\nUm makes you have this messenger app on your phone ... on on your mobile device so when you want to use messenger yet right so you it's like almost like if you got when you get the other ones just like a two for one day I'll see you have this messenger rap and then based on the way the correct me if I'm wrong\nIs based on the way that you send your potential customer a question it will kind of lead them down and decision tree and they will um ... you know I guess prompted them to the next question until they kind of get them to like south\nYeah if you're out there and you're like a small business and you know that you could get a direct connection to your potential client by using Facebook Messenger but then you start to worry that oh you know what I didn't what do I have to have somebody there messaging with them interacting\nBack and forth with them they have that aren't true is that also\nSee the answer is you can set that up or we can do it for you would do it for some of our clients\nWith artificial intelligence which is basically pre programmed\nQuestions and answers to those people that you set up a through use of these chat pots and you'll engage with somebody through messenger asking them a question they'll have one of two answers are a few answers depending on what they say they'll get another uh either questioner answer\nAnd we actually take the time and we program those responses and that whole\nConversation really so that they get the ah information that they need and hopefully a the funnel leads them to reaching out to you to fill out of contact forum setting up a consultation you know whatever it is that you're looking to achieve\nBut yeah we can manage the whole um you know messenger ad campaign and then the chat bought a essentially I mean if you think about it it's like you're having another employee round the clock\nThat's going to be able to interact with your potential audience in the way that we program it too it's pretty cool stuff\nI mean one day maybe I'm going to invite Eric [noise] maybe call him 'cause he's out in San Francisco and he deals with in a much higher level because he's running a whole new brand for the\nGap but there's a lot of\nWays that this technology works really really well for smaller medium that smaller businesses\nThat they just uh they kind of throw a wrench into the works and\nThey don't want to ah help you out they don't want to give control in their mind maybe to another digital marketing company and\nWe've had the site built and ready to go but because the third party involve wouldn't give us access to just point a record one of the uh the NS records or to uh the files on our server\nIt that you know the client basically has been without their new website for at least three weeks maybe close to four weeks or so and we finally are you know getting resolved inside is going up but\nSometimes you do you give control over your or whether it's your domain or you're hosting I'm a service or in the management of your side or your listings to the wrong outfit out there and um you know it it it comes back to bite you and we've seen time and time again\nBefore you go with any digital marketing company or provider out there trying to get some referrals from them try to get some people you can reach out to if they don't have a lot of reviews on line first thing you'd probably want to do is check the reviews see what other people are saying about them\nBut um we've seen this this stuff happened to many times and we we work hard to resolve it and we usually do\nBut um it can make life difficult so it definitely does complicated\nAny a recent a horror stories from your travels gentleman\nFor before I go to that we're just going to bring one I'm\nA I just noticed that we're not doing the ... thing and you guys are just saying you know all over the place\nYeah let's go on march ... and stuff like that but you [laughter] you know you know you know you know what I mean I Know okay\n[laughter] [noise] what I was pretty good [noise] modified [laughter]\nWell a boy\nSo anyway we usually have sorting out on video we do have another horror story not just read um video too\nWe had a company who had a global my business page that was built in claim for this other company\nAnd basically held the guy hostage to have him release it which\nIs very different than what we do where we kinda ... what kind of we actually give you guys the ownership the control of all this stuff and we managed for you which is the way it's supposed to be you don't let anybody go ahead and control and own your own Google my business page which is your most important\nListening on the Internet and I don't give up that ownership sometimes that's it well\nWe got that without a lot of people don't know so and in our office will go ahead and claim ownership and then ... it takes a while to cause they have to Google van\nContacts the email of record that's supposedly the owner ... and hopefully those people are still in business and then you have to wait a certain amount of time if they don't get back in touch with you to go through this whole process is that the price of oil\nAnd and you are aware of it was like you know you're aware we're aware that there are so many business owners that have no idea who\nControls a lot of this stuff I don't know Andrew wants to\nAgree yes you want to be right so the other day I was with the client and we went on his ... page and this guy does tree service and you know what images were on guys ya'll page\nAnd that caught in that context you know is the proper way it is you have to say that oh do you know yeah um\nYou said what pictures were there what what images of the ... this tree service company ... ... do you think we're I'm the guy floating or download it on on his yelled he was floating in his pool with the little rubber ducking\nClose it was pictures of sushi and receive from a Chinese restaurant and I brought this I brought this to this guy's attention he's like how does this get there\nAnd I said well now you know and I\nWhat happened you never know where you're gonna find in the tree you know the ... the amazing thing is with these listings is that if you're not a looking at what these listings are showing it could be corrupted you could actually have a company that you hire to manage your listings in something that we do really well at some local as manager listings\nBut the companies that you hire or the list things that you had may be completely irrelevant or inaccurate\nAnd so these are horror stories that are right under your nose and you could be paying a company or to be managing his for you and you know you call some local than what we'll do as well I actually do an audit Mitchell listings are concise accurate sync up and updated\nI Would love to know the back story behind the sushi and the Chinese food receipts on a tree serve\nThe guy was blown away so\nHe was ... like how do you actually I'm a nice job and and and the tree I also do the trick I also had a\nGoogle my business lifting with some wacky address with a phantom phone number\nSo these things pop up all the time and you're not monitoring the stuff that we know that uh\nThis stuff happened to all the time when the back and that's why Google or is you know updating their their security I don't I think we spoke about this a few weeks ago or they're recommending strongly recommending that every website has S. S. L. certificate\nWhich basically an authentic authenticate the fact that you had a verified website that it needs specific criteria on Google Search engines and if you don't have this is going to say not secure now how many business owners how many listeners out there actually know that\nThat this is even a requirement I I Will tell you right now if you are trying to get business on line and you have that I'm not secure site is going to be a lot of people that are not going to click on to your website and you're going to lose business\nAnd these are all things are happening in real time right now with your list things with your website if you want a company that's obviously on there again that's on top of this stuff\nThat you know they're one goal is to make you look good on line and the ... to that is getting business and phone calls and look up give us a call the top level\nYou want to give the numbers just want to let 'em fend for themselves\nWhat the numbers switched to not be

[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAt least Fifteen Years before Facebook ever started I think [noise] and um\nAnd that eventually I came back you know then then you time goes by I had a daughter in one day you know I I didn't have a child till I was fifty\nEight and a one day when my daughter was eight years old she came to the dining table and said a picture of her she was she said dad we should we should do shoes together and I said I said do you notice that I used to be in the shoe business I\nDidn't even know that she ever knew that I didn't talk about particularly and um she said yeah she said you you know I grandpa told me that you used to make shoes\nI so I said I'll you know I'll think about this let me think about this for a while and that's how that's how Samuel Hubbard began amazing I'm here I Am back in the shoe business for a while [laughter]\n[noise] yeah we have a lot to cover so I'm going to jump right in um everyone knows this saying yeah beauty or Spain or you know no pain no gain is that people might feel that you know to wear a a a a nice and attractive pair of shoes you know if you're going to have to suffer\nHandle Hubbard is the exact opposite we're a very fashionable pair and it's extremely comfortable you know why how did you\nMean how did you even solve that to begin to wrap your head around and say you know what it doesn't have to be painful to wear a tractor\nYeah well I even when I was in Rockport unless you're a business um\nI was almost the anti fashion guy I was the guy would go around and say to people you know in the future people are not going to wear ties and jackass and address that way there they're going to where you know much more ... it's not going to just be casual friday they all thought it was sort of heretic to save a sense but [noise]\nAnd I thought you know people want to be comfortable eventually it's not just on friday they want to be comfortable and um [noise] we\nThe whole lightweight shoe concept started when when when Nike brought up the waffles trainer or the first I still have a ... that the original payer\nBecause I bought a pair and I put these things on and they were so light and so comfortable I went oh my God that we were making these we had been making these crepes so heavy shoes it probably weighed four or five pounds of hair\nThat was very comfortable bouncy shoes but there were like lead\nI put these on and I said this is it I said if we don't make shows like this were finished the day will come when people only will want to wear this so\nI really ... myself a goal I said if we don't make if the shoes not as comfortable as a running shoe and this is not going to be sure I'm going to wear and I don't think anyone else eventually gonna wear either and\nWe started off making kind of casual type shoes in those days and eventually we realized well people still want to look sharks right and so how do you do that so that took I learned that years and years ago that what it what it's supposed to do that but when I came back to it this time\nI just I decided that I could improve on that and improve on it a lot and um so I just took the ... on this product I just took the limits off and I said what can we do to make the best possible show that people they just put it on in your vote yes\nYeah and um\nSo we're just setting limits for ourselves we used to find this Leathers and we'd leather lined the shoe and which I bought maybe a hundred or thought acts and I tried them all out and you know I Would be the guy at the adult as a component show in Germany going around barefoot running up and down the aisle trying on different things\nThat people would go and squeeze them I say no I let me put that in my shoe and so little by little I found out a way to do it and um I mean there are there's a limit you cannot make super pointed shoes\nBecause the footage and shake that way but if you make the shorter longer you can you can you can give it a nice looking so I think what we do\nA bit I mean aside from the fact that uh you know\nMany of the audience have seen the ads in the wall Street Journal etc you're clearly also targeting the business community the ah the businessmen who needs to be sharp but at the same time doesn't want to be in pain all day yeah\nI yeah I when I look at I mean right now it's amazing coming back to the business and seeing how many people are wearing sneakers\nFor everything I mean I I just went to Paris a few weeks ago just to shop the windows and so he wasn't into Milan and over there I mean all the women are wearing nothing but sneakers you're all all the fancy shoes you can't find them they're all you can buy eight hundred dollar sneakers but there were pretty crazy looking stuff [noise]\nI think it was possible to have you know something that looked appropriate for a business setting but that had the same comfort and I knew I could do that and so really we came up with this idea of what we started calling the un sneaker\nAnd I'm going to be my next question and how to in Illinois and how to do that because I don't think everybody has to look like they're just you know like they just came from the gym you know with the baseball hat and ... and they're going to a ...\nIt's not appropriate and it's not it's not the right setting and many times it could even affect the conversation packaging is packaging\nIs a very very critical role in any setting and certainly in a business setting my guess this evening is none other than Bruce cats founder and CEO of the Sandy will Hubbard shoe company

a success was riding around Seventy seven WABC my guest this evening is none other than Bruce cats\nThe founder and CEO of Samuel Hubbard shoe company there many of the audience that are very excited about the show because they're probably jumping up and down now in their Harvard's [laughter]\nUm I Know I Am in mind I'm not jumping up and down I mean I'm interviewing the founder and CEO so [laughter] I'm behaving myself but definitely with a very comfortable pair of shoes so thank you for 'em you invented\nThe un sneaker okay to trademark\nOf this annual Hubbard brand by the way you could visit them on line their their their retailers nationwide that carry it but just briefly many people wonder okay how can I ought to repair Samuel Hubbard dot com Samuel Hubbard is but to be a to B B. A. R. D. dot com\nNowhere at all and uh so I finally thought back well what we know we used to run ads and I thought well let's why don't we try some ads and so I decided I said I'm going I'm going to\nYou know I was trying to keep a modest budget for this whole thing right and I said okay I'm going to invest another two hundred thousand dollars in this business because I have all the issues now I'm going to put two hundred thousand dollars worth of ads for the next six months to see what happens\nAnd so I went to the New York times and I bought some uh to call them five and a to Colorado and then she adds on page three and I bought some magazines space the magazine space was you know Fifteen thousand pages I'm like well we'll never really paid for this but at least will announce that we exist\nAnd lo and behold the first ad ran I think it was July twenty third and I had to sell something like you know thirty here to pay for it and we still thirty six pair\nWow do you remember which magazine that was\nThere was in the New York times page three ... on on the black and white out on the bottom right color column and then um that we ran you know the next Tuesday we were in another ad and we sold enough a thirty five here and I went wow last long story short\nWithin twelve months I'd run over a million dollars worth of advertising and I still had my two hundred thousand dollars I had because every single time I ran an ad I Would sell enough shoes to pay for the ad and a little extra left over to\nYou know buy a cup of coffee so [laughter] and and that's how it happens that I went back into print and um you know now we're moving to a whole new phase where we've got enough recognition out there that social media becomes much more interesting and we've done a lot to figure out who are customer is why do they like our shoes\nWhat does it what is it they're looking for 'em and all these sorts of things that would lead your two very different way to go to market but we did an enormous amount of ... we did I think last year one point four billion print depressions wow print right between Wall Street journal and this is very ... you know this is very old fashioned\nRight um but it oh and I I I have friends who say what are you doing you know doing this and I\nI really felt to to to build and aware of it and then the other part of it was that we decided that we really needed to put some shoes outer wholesale because I really wanted people to\nHave the experience that actually trying the shoe on until I could build initial audience like that now that I Know people have started shoe companies where they're you know a hundred percent digital\nUm you know there are some great examples that right now that are going out that way um I think it works better in women's shoes and trying to get men that are into these types of issues because women love to talk about their shoes\nYou know some men talk about their shoes but nothing like the women talk about their shoes and if it's fashion it's even you know there's even more to talk about\nBut to get a man into this type of shoe the other thing that happened that was really a ... you know difficult is that I mean I really came at this thing from a personal passion what would I Want aware how would I Want this to be and I said I Will make the best you can when it's done we're going to find out how much it costs\nWere going to take a normal mark up and that's going to be the price of the shoe\nAnd so our shoes you know cost typically two hundred and twenty five to two hundred and fifty dollars but we have you know Gore Tex surely line shoes that can be three hundred are up and when I took these things to the shoe stores\nWhat the reaction was really remarkable I Would go to see maybe a guy that I knew from twenty five years ago ... while Bruce this is fantastic God they they've mix and these are made in Portugal they made in Europe they made with you know Italian Leathers and European materials and Italian souls and\nAnd so forth and he said this this and you can't you can't make a shoe any better than this is fantastic he said\nI I just don't have a customer for two hundred and thirty dollar shoe\nBut can you got me up here\n\nAnd the interesting thing really was that was that the consumers understood the shoes better than the retailers the ... the retailers are running scared that you know they were used to selling hundred and fifty million dollar men shoes a hundred and eighty dollar men she was a hundred and twenty the consumers walked in and\nThey understood because really what were selling is more like if this was a fair a domino or Gucci or something that would be a four or five hundred dollar show like so we didn't go out with a marketing campaign and said oh we are going to give you a four hundred dollar shoe for me for two hundred and fifty dollars\nBut in fact you can't make a shoe any better than this you can't use better materials you can't get finer details at that price and that any ... you can't make up about ... you can't make it you can make it by hand and make it take forever you know not stitching machine just about every stitch in by hand but you won't get a better chew\nIt won't feel any better look any better than that so um you know we buy the most expensive loves us the most expensive linings\n... there's no there's no corners that are cut\nBut what I've really found is that the consumers understand these kinds of things better than than that's a lot of retailers and I think back to the apple computer\nAnd how you know people say oh so they're fantastic computers but for Fifteen hundred dollars I can buy a dollar a Compaq for six hundred ... hundred dollar and IBM why would I Want to spend you know twelve hundred dollars\nTried to get a Macintosh computer away from somebody who has a Mac [laughter] you know they're just looking forward to the next one so this is what happened with the issues\nIs that we went outside of the normal boundaries of what people thought they would pay for sure but a letter after letter after letter said I never spent so much on a pair of shoes and now I Can't wear any other show\nAt such a great takeaway right there that uh you know sometimes the retailers themselves don't spots are ... maybe they're too close to the situation to even spot the opportunity but if they give it a shot and they tried they have now vow I didn't realize the opportunity he says\nWhat and this happens over and over and over again\nI had a I have one funny story was running a truck show in a store my salesman that Trump shows where you put all your different models out and it was it was we ... it was on the trunk show for men's shoes in a women's store and the woman\nWas overt talking to my salesman and ... and um she said what what the issues all about it and he was telling her interest at all like you know my husband never buy you know he would never buy two hundred and fifty dollar shoes and the talking way and suddenly they look over and her husband is checking out with\nTwo pair [laughter] yeah she's looking at him like what are you [laughter] so half of our\n... half of the people that call us our women buy shoes for men that's an amazing statistic half the people out in the women who are on the telephone on the telephone half of the ... and half of the people that we get two thousand phone calls a week and I know you wanted to talk about customer support\nSo yes so we're actually going to take a commercial break but when we come back we're going to talk about the fact I mean you won the gold Stevie award that's not an easy accomplishment and we love talking about customer service here at one of our famous guest sweatshop hiking um so we certainly want to get to that we're going to take a short commercial break stay tuned\nHey Joe give me a minute I'm going to run the numbers on circle back next week posted on Facebook linked in just

seven WABC week in a week out we've been here since\nMid twenties Fifteen pretty exciting was going to be in our fifth calendar year come twenty Nineteen it's pretty exciting um in with the ratings and special thanks to the wonderful listeners and the great feedback I receive all the time my guests this evening is\nI Can't see you that's okay but if you'd like to talk to me I'm happy to help you and if you'd like to see a shoe just tell me which ones you'd like to see and then you would direct them to go around Rico you want to say I want to see this over on the ... and they would show it to you and tell you about the show and then I thought\nWell how would I scale this and I said well maybe I'll just hire students who are traveling around the world and they can do sky from the beach or wherever they are at a cafe in Nepal\nAnd they will just have a service that will automatically load you know send these people out to the sessions and they'll all but ... you know ten dollars appear if they could you know sell a pair of shoes right so\nI I I've always wanted to ... I still don't think I built a website that I Would like to build because I think I've actually you'd like to actually have an experience of of actually communicating with some of it but we do the best we can with with uh with the printed basically the printed page on the Web\nOr another question is you've been scaling the business and we certainly from your initial purchase a Fifteen hundred pairs\nA Fifteen thousand two thousand I'm Sorry Fifteen thousand period I that you ... well\nYeah that if they're under like ... probably given them my friends [laughter]\nSo you had talked about or you know ... scaling a business I mean we ... that is really my question that we talked about but\nHow what ... what are your tips on scaling a bit business that was built and it's it's solid and you're getting great customer reviews et cetera but then you want to take it to the next level what are your tips for a business that\nIs that this is something we can spend an hour on but I I was always a bootstrap entrepreneur because when I started when my father and I started Rockport at the end of the Harvard shoe factory closing\nThe total family paid in capital was Fifteen thousand dollars that's all we had left I had five my brother had five and my mother had five thousand under the mattress or something and that was so we had to make money from day one that has not been possible for me in this business this has taken substantial investment to get to where we are today [noise]\nI still believe because it's kind of almost you know business religious belief or be that you can do it you know by being profited from the beginning\nAnd I think a lot of companies you know they'd go out and raise a lot of money actually never figure out you know how to become profitable because they built a culture around oh we're just going to gain scale\nAnd it's all about scale and it doesn't matter real for going to lose ten million this year and twenty million next year and then you know again we're going to make a hundred million dollars ... when we salad or when we I don't know what I mean I I I think you'd have to try to build something that\nThe scales by being practical and profitable as soon as you possibly can and if you buildings that way it may be a little smaller coming out of the ground it may look like a seedlings that's barely going anywhere\nBut if you build it on that if you build that culture\nThen you will build a company that will that will always stay profitable and will will will be very very healthy and the other can be really you know and go the other way\nGreat advice um print versus digital and they'd marketing world and now we touched on it earlier a you run an aggressive campaign in the times in the wall Street Journal let's come back to that for a minute you know like\nYou said some of your buddies say love print is dead you know right while you're cutting out all these days I mean\nWe're doing we're doing you know a lot of mail order catalogs to seven Seventy page mail order catalogs really young Seventy pay out of the rings is this year or two and a half million you know we did two and a half million catalog part of that for me the print is that\nI Know I I have people who just actually just yesterday debated me very seriously I felt like to create an image for a company to create some feeling about what it's about ... you know what it means to wear a pair of these beyond just that it's a good product and the people like wearing it\nYou know what does it stand for and I've always ask myself how would you build Ralph Lauren I'm\nAll over again without ever using print or billboard or a fashion show or a mansion on Madison Avenue how would you create that sort of a charisma an image for something and so [noise]\nYou know I I'm I'm very visual now you can build all kinds of images on the Web but the but the it's so this is just so you kind of a ... you know Syria which is kind of there goes the way it doesn't\nYou know it doesn't have the credit will you will arrive in Milan and you see a billboard all the way up the side of a building from monitored while you know it's just and you and some pills fantastic scene or some static photograph or something so I think there's a lot to be said for the visual printed page\nYou know it it it just it is absolutely a dying industry that in terms of you know the printed publications that mean we're supposed to newspapers are struggling to magazines is they're all struggling against digital media but I think that's really a place for it in the\nIn the mix I mean going forward I think we will use a lot more um social media types of activities because now we have\nYou know we have we're heading for a couple of hundred thousand people who are wearing the shoes and at that point you know than an ad and you're listening to talk about oh a friend of mine told me about those and just you know and and then you can really not that I visited a company yesterday that did it entirely\nIn digital and has a very you know and and then ramped up tens of thousands of users completely from a digital conversation\nAnd it seems very ironic to be the eggs I spent fourteen years pioneering online community\nThat I Would be a manager you but in a way when I came back I kind of fell back into what I knew\nYou know and I have to point that is that every smart in ... in business understands that you're going to reach out to the people in the channels that you'll connect with them I mean I have here in my office a draw full of mailings that have come from\nA Google and\nOther companies I mean even to receive mail from Google yeah isn't that sounds ... I don't I don't know that right\nBut the answer is Google isn't stupid they understand that they have to reach the people in through various different channels of course I get emails from them and there is on line way that they're reaching out but they're also using any form of marketing that they know will work so um\nWe're actually very close to out of time but before you know before we go\nMy final question would be a you know the the yeah you have a life of experience in so many different areas and of course within the shoe retail industry\nOr any final takeaways that you could give to aspiring business people or people that want to go to the next level in their career what advice would you give Bruce\n... I have an answer I Want to give you a ... I have to give credit to these people I visited a wonderful company in Portsmouth New Hampshire called rust and salt and I felt like I had three hours at a table with six business shrinks yesterday and they all\nHelp me enormously and I I've I have to thank them\nUm for the time that they that they spent because I really came away with a focus and the ... because they could see it and I couldn't see it and what they said was you know what you're doing you are following your passion\nIt's not that you needed another business because you didn't need another business and it's not like you're making shoes 'cause everybody does no shoes in the world you are you started with a shoe he wanted to make for yourself\nAnd you're following that passion and and and and that's what you should continue to focus on as you go forward is make sure that what you're doing is right in the sweet spot of what you're passionate about and if you stay in that spot then that will come across and you will do the right thing and you will you will you will find your way to the place you're supposed to be in the world of business\nBruce I Can't think of enough to join me her mind your business\nOr while I was a pleasure to speak with you what a great show in case you're just doing it now I don't know where your but good news by Tuesday\nIn this entire episode will be up on the permanent channel for this show and why be radio dot com M.

in all ways that didn't cure him because of the purpose of surgery for prostate cancer is secure the man\nHe was not cured and he was left him put a pan and confident and he came to us\nFor a second chance and we gave him a second chance we explained all the options and we treated them with our pinpoint not invasive treatments and\nFinally finally he's in remission with our treatment we had to clean up the mess that the surgeons left behind so sad we have information that we can send you a of a book with DVD we have a two part DVD actually with one of the major New York city talk show

in New York City right breast cancer with lymph node involvement ... carcinoma should distortion of the brass you stage three\nAnd her four years she had no treatment so she was diagnosed four years ago she had a biopsy show your cancer was behind the nipple and the right side\nJetted invasive cancer she has worked up at one of the big hospitals\nAnd the surgeon once again told her she had to have served or just like the surge into that man with prostate cancer the only difference is this patient refused any treatment she refused the mist activity she did not want to lose her breast\nAnd she went to a second hospitals second big hospitals another surgeon and she again refused mastectomy she had no treatment she came to me the cancers enlarging the skin does involve the nipple was distorted the breast was distorted the skin was turning red\nAs amass under the armpit weighs a hundred and twelve pounds\nI saw her eye exam material there was a three by four centimeter masked behind the nipple in the right side there was distortion of the nipple distortion ... are complex abreast was short for short is a cancer was eating through their breast it took the substance of the breast\nAnd there was this massive multiple them for those that I could feel the armpit she came to us with stage three cancers remember refusing treatment for four years she rather than have the cancer grow than had mastectomy chemotherapy she came to us\nAnd one more thing I should tell you that we treated her one year ago\nShe was treated one year ago with only invisible beams on the invisible beams of focus radio surgery returns that cancer\nAnd I saw this week well why are we talking about or this week well because it's one year later and she is in remission that cancer is gone the breast is back to normal there was no alarms and Obama snow armpit masses no breast masses\nShe is doing well only with our treatment membership waited years to come to us she let that breast become distorted destroyed\nAnd then came to us and and luckily for her and luckily for us we were able to have the information and the knowledge and the wherewithal to offer her treatment as she requested remember here at the Kennedy for Broadway the\nPatient is the president of United States of his or her body this woman is the president she declined misdirected me she declined chemo she at archery wood and she is now in remission doing well\nAnd that's the way she likes it that's the way we like it because we were able to finally trees or after years of cancer growth in cancer distortion of the breast finally she's in remission all with non invasive outpatient therapy this is the work we do\nAnd don't talk about a man a man who's got a loving family sixty four years old is born in Spain\nCame with his wife came with his daughter was diagnosed last year with the pancreas cancer there's already traveled to the liver that means that stage four hit a ... pancreas cancer and then they had chemo ... got fancy chemo expensive chemo\nAnd well he had seven cycles of chemo at the cancer markers rows and uh there are cancer markers for pancreas cancer the most common one is see a Ninety nine and they say that in case you or your friends have a pancreas cancer you can find\nSee how the cancer is doing well this cancer kept on growing growing growing and he had severe is terrible shoulder pain and clever co pay and you could barely move [noise]\nAnd so the doctors at that big hospital took him into the hospital for\nA week they kept them for a week they do them arise bone scans\nAnd then they found the mass of the cloud called and they stuck at NATO and the ...\nAnd they found cancer there\nWell how would we have done things differently well number one if you came with shoulder pain we wouldn't put them in the hospital for a week and every one number two we can do the testers outpatient\nNumber three most probably we would have ticket NATO and because this man he already was known to have stage for cancers all ready traveled to the liver he already was known to have staged for cancer the chemo was working the pain was getting worse they stuck that needle in the ...\nAnd they fractured as classical now the law is a massive cancer in the classical but when they put the needle in the fractured the clerical\nAnd he's on oxygen code on his on a cottage in our colleagues in the scanner narcotics by mouth and we found the mass noninvasive Lee and uh we're treating him non invasive leave with no ... no bleeding\nAnd that's the work we do without that hospitals stayed for most people come here they do not end up in the hospital some people say oh where do we go for the house by say well I could take Ninety nine percent of the time there is no need to be in the hospital this man never needed to be in the hospital to find the cancer and the ...\nCould easily have done a bone scan or C. T. scan showed them as\nThey could have easily avoided the biopsy and easily avoided the fractured classical which this man's going crazy with pain because of the fracture classical the diagnosis and work up was as bad as the cancer itself\nAnd so it's always the thought when the doctors are uptight well we can\nCaught on you or do another biopsy or yet in the air another yet another biopsy you might want to come over to search for Broadway and learn if you really need to have that I'm teen biopsy this man did not need it was clear it was cancer as ... CAT scan was positive\nAnd the spy absurdist lead to more pain and more suffering in a procedure and I miss the should lay\nProlonging hospital stay which in my view wasn't needed at all\nAnd that's

about prostate cancer and he's the man who's lived a life\nOr not only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion\nFrom Dr Gilead 'em in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear fright and hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out the control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery at ... and I've been kicking myself and it took his ever since maybe the\nDome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow that you've been shot up with hollow shell bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat\nFive times with ... someone was trying to kill ya\nOh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery you said oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of demands with my body liquids and I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant\nWho can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt\nLike wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead them in and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what a man doesn't is like from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day\nAnd then to try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Mike I might as well have been a unique I Wish him put ten and naturally that plays a head game on you know now you don't even\nFeel like you're a man any longer it was just a bad decision and I didn't have the guidance and I should've come right to you for\nThat second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery and I would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain palaces and we leave myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since it was twenty twelve and I'm Still play ... with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWe ever worn you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I see you took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being incontinent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know ... about that in advance\nYour amount of communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard of it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in ... I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure of themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go wrong\nIt was more like a Powell Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize oh my God as you look at the ivy that you're strong too and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust the little toddler in\nFact now all of a sudden you're wearing the pad and sometimes it depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was at my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging\nBut I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only was a in good shape I wasn't heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery because now\nWhen your basic functions when you can't you are in eight when you can have sex when all of those things go right not only does it affect\nYou mentally and you get depressed but you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you had an accident and now what do you do grab a sweater and wrap\nIt around yourself and run off to the new rich bathroom and then you always carrying around that depends with you and you're saying why did I Do this to myself and my ... and he said no I'm not ... I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is you talked to delete 'em in because you're not part of the old boy's club your independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYou'll patients painless methods of recovery fully remaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer you\nKnow there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars have I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota\nAnd you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be turning them into a person who can no longer physically\nFunction why am I doing this when there are other remedies and why are they doing it because this is their business the surge and all they know how to do is cut out your prostate gland that controls so much of what a man does and I would suggest everyone out there\nA void that at all costs don't be still not don't be do me like I was get that valued second opinion from Dr ... lead them in because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and you will feel fully functional again thank you so much my place\nAnd I was talking about a Seventy six year old woman was like seven children she's very southern children\nAnd inches high blood pressure gall bladder and she had radiation for gall bladder cancer\nAnd so it was all talk about it very much for cancer can actually started most of the part of the body she had a small cancer was out of no carcinoma should surgery the cancer traveled to reverse of the surgery wasn't really useful shut standard radiation and standard chemo\nAnd that wasn't useful either the cats are just kept on growing so what's the difference between our treatment and what people get in the usual places well number one we're able to more accurately focus the be on the cancer\nNumber two by doing that we can increase the intensity make the beam more intense and we know the more intense the bigger the dos generally can get better success when that can be safely done\nAnd this is the work we do that's why body radio surgery and reduce or so revolutionary that's why one every hospital or a doctor in every facility standard treatment was okay\nOne doctor stood up and so there was a better way the better way is to be able to be more focused\nTo less collateral damage to have higher doses and higher success and fewer treatments so's fewer treatments means it's costs less fewer treatments means it's less inconvenient fewer treatments I mean when the doses are escalated\nBetter results and that's the work that we do the best of my knowledge we're the only senator in New York one of the few in America using a stereotype to crime were first in America first in New York\nAnd you've got a new MRI which shows new spread of the cancer is back pain for six months which is what we've been talking about all day rather than treating the cancer and making the cancer go away\nThey keep on giving them immunotherapy which doesn't work costing tens of thousands of dollars given narcotics to cover up the pay which causes pain by itself\nIs wait before it was two hundred Ninety five pounds and he's now down to a hundred and Seventy four pounds he lost a hundred and twenty five pounds this man and he has cancer multiple spines\nHis he had an uncle who died of lung cancer is married he has two year old child he has every reason to Olivia Seventy for every patient has every reason to live quite frankly\nAnd I met with him I encourage them to bring his wife and he just sent me an\nEmail and you can send an email if you have questions if you're ... the radio you can email it killed my emails guild GI out at our as then why dot org\nKill that are as and wide dot org\nWell he just emailed me today that said he wants our treatment he does not want to go to that super duper big cancer places and I want to go to the super duper hospitals where he's betrayed of all the treatment he's had has been use\nHad needle biopsies that were I think are done in a good way he didn't they opened up his knock wood I don't think they need to do that then they gave him chemo and radiation which did not work\nThan he had months and months of chemo immunotherapy just isn't worth the cancer and I kept on traveling but they left in pain and the cancer kept on growing this is what he has and he wishes to come to us why to get rid of the cancer pay in to get rid of those spots of cancer and was fine\nGet rid of the pain and tried to get as much normal life as possible\nAnd there's another store another man eighty two years old is electrician he's married with three kids get throat cancer you went to one of the big hospitals the usual chemo unusual radiation and then he was seen that one of the big hospitals and when he told them that he's coming to me they got angry they got angry at the man but\nListen to this he's been fallen down and he's been busy I examined them when I examined\nHim his eyes don't move in the same way though when you and I most likely look to the left our eyes move till after I moved to the right size go to the right this man I examined him when I asked them to follow my fingers eyes go over the left side\nThey wouldn't go they were stuck in the middle we got immediately a brain tumor I immediately we found multiple cancers in his brain even though there was at one of the biggest hospitals and one of the specialists who specializes in the head and neck cancer taking care of him and he was in the hospital\nThe test was never a\nIt was just there the day before he saw me and they wanted to do him into therapy where they try to him you know therapy they tried chemotherapy didn't work\nLike TiVo doesn't work the chemo doesn't work is double vision and we immediately got the scan we made the diagnosis and were trading him and this is the work that we do every day also an exam is multiple to send them into Iraq hard lymph nodes and the left neck\nAnd this is what we do we're able to attack cancers whether it's in the brain or the ... the body this is the work that we do every day\nEvery day another man sixty seven years old he had prostate surgery or one of the big hospitals he was left impotent incontinent after robotic surgery and the cancer came back\nAnd we treated him he gave them a second chance thank God we were able to return to him and he is in remission and another man who has a cancer with bone marrow failure as ball Merrill doesn't work\nHe came to us with a bone marrow failure and cancer the pancreas growing through the intestines bleeding out he was at one of the biggest hospitals advertise all the time how great they are way went there with a cancer and the ...\nGrowing from the pancreas removed won with bone marrow failure normal hemoglobin the sixteen his hemoglobin was for they send them home to die he didn't want to die he came to me Seventy two came with his wife came with his family we talked about all the options we talked about dying\nSure you can do that if you wish or you can try treatment other treatments we talked about all the options which he was never given that super duper big place we treated him just to the few treatments to the mass in the pancreas that was eating through the investments\nAnd by the second ten minute treatment our treatments for about ten minutes patience lay down a beam motion thousands of angles to attack the cancer by the second treatment that cancer stopped the bleeding stopped he was having black Terry stools which is a sight of blood in the intestines\nBlack ties to all stopped using transfusions every day the transfusion stop\nAnd now with our treatment not only is the cancer resolved where we've attack that the bleeding as resolved he doesn't need any more transfusions and his blood counts are coming up\nRemember this is a man that was sent home to die from one of the biggest hospitals so this is the work we do remember we are first in America first in the western hemisphere with body radio surgery\nWhen I brought body right asserted to America people sort of a it's a gimmick it's a scam well who is the gimmick and who is the scam as at the place that census mad home to die or the doctor who treated them stop the cancer

Cuban your new green tea yarn liquid soft formula which purity is given away for free today first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ... which is super hot right now there was no some of the headlines and the science behind a spiritual I notes from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about ... ... is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in to issue and\nInsulin sensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the key is to the so called\nFrench paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine ate a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair\nBut ... appears to be key in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the Kirk human\nWith blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take ... you'd get brain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nIt again we're talking with Chris killing all you needed the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Chris let's laser in on how this wonderful formula you created to junction purity products I Know that ... he's been a business now for what is it over Twenty years ago ...\nReading the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T. C. R. today we'll give that number out in a few minutes but first what\nDoes she are being foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid soft you why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and risk there a trial\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the recent\nThat it's in a liquid soft shell is\nThat that allows for rapid end very complete absorption I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell\nYou just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines that means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements\nSo green T. C. R. as green tea Kirk human ...\nAnd the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for the three particular ingredient\nOf course before John our listeners how they get their very own complementary bottle of ...

could get stronger with the extra strength make your life better certainly make about this are you weaker today than you were say oh I don't know Twenty years ago\nWell listen if you answered yes to any of these questions than stay tuned\nDr ... eleven is joining us today to discuss a miraculous compound with hundreds\nOf clinical studies that just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger and healthier at any age now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokesperson and a longtime advisor for purity products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed today we're talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of Korea teen I Know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nSome amazing stories can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain\nStrength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction and it's important to help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all those are the stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles now the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier\nSports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and only like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel and I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that\nStaying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan styled are if this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say
