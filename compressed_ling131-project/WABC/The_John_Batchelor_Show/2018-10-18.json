I mean as brash an ethics than the first chief directorate from three thousand ten thousand\nThis is late seventies before the invasion of Afghanistan and then and drop off comes in in eighty two and in Institute's operation rye on which is his paranoid interpretation of the world at the U.S was about to launch a first nuclear strike\nAnd the first chief directorate at this point at was evidence of a complete breakdown in communication and order they they were there were forthright eat eat at best there were no longer effective it was a revelation to MIT ... CIA that they were up against\nA flabby and ancient and lost bureaucracy they were completely amazed when they finally discovered that know\nWhat I take from lake KGB thinking is that it's all about internal office politics everything was driven on the basis of stabbing the guy above you in the back and making sure the guy behind you didn't stab you in the back\nIs that recognizable in China now is that what we're seeing or or we have we got ... drop off in ... in front of us that's coming in years to ... in the out years\nWell I don't think we have many out years but I think you're absolutely right because the problem is one of the problems is that two years ago when the Chinese started this whole thing by making this unprecedented illegal grab a basically to Mediterranean Sea\nThat they had no advisors about the United states\nWho knew anything with the party line so they said well the United states will do nothing and of course in fact the Obama administration did do nothing\nBut they had no one who really knew what was going on enough to be able to watch of Americans if you push against the wall they may come out punching and you won't like it if you've ever been a good idea\nBut because of the way training and office politics work there anybody who said such a thing and any pointed as education would have been kicked out\nSo they had they had got rid of all faiths systematically taken out all the people who might have had youthful insights into the United states and all they have are people who have Heather too but able to say the right thing but\nWhen confronted with a new situation where Trump apparently it's not about to cut a deal he's gonna keep going we look in their ... and we look at the behavior their diplomatic federal thing come on Americans\nStart art acting like the good old America's ... where you do a fool every day uh take those glasses off and I got the blurred vision back\nAnd this is they're they're really steamed about this because of course it's a huge loss of face them\nUh when I\nRemember that nothing is really going quite right in China has how the economy is not growing they're\nPrinting money by the time they don't they don't know what to do to make the China Dream that uh she sort of conjured up to make it actually come into reality of the fact is they can't do it\nArthur Walter and them the University of Pennsylvania Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast on John ...\n[noise]\nYou all know that I traveled to the Republican ... this past some it was my second trip in two years broadcasting from the riches of the Caspian Sea thing\nI discovered that Azerbaijan as a country him down to ...\nThe farmland produces the Russians food and Eurasia\nThe energy sectors are standing by the minute now reaching up pipelines Asia Minor and your to help with energy security for our allies and for ... what I've learned is that Azerbaijan as a prosperous country with big dreams and the leadership to support the dreaming of freedom and grow on the legendary Silk Road\nI'm most privileged to have the embassy of the Republican John in the U.S\nTo support my weekly business reporter I Will be highlighting what I'm learning about Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea regular from foods the energy to a knowledge of the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in the region I look forward to exploring and I invite you alone [noise]\nBalance of nature\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company\nOther companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in test it and I fear that people will buy some counterfeit don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely the best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out\nI mean that was on the market nothing ever worked for the first thing that's really what nothing to compare what the benefits of damage to cheer\nFor a limited time use discount code W.

[noise]\nI'm not so with Gordon Chang report within these last hours I follow the NBC's reporting melt is marketwatch forgive me ... reporting the Treasury Department again declined to label China a currency manipulator instead settling for a stern warning\nAbout recent slide and the value of the Chinese one or renminbi the treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted a particular concern are China's lack of currency transparency and the recent weakness in its current say a down ten percent this year\nTreasury went on to say that it estimated the direct intervention by the people's bank of China this year quote has been limited\nA garden we welcome our friend Alan tunnels and to comment on currency manipulation yes or no you take a guard so Alan\nWas the treasury correct in not designating China a currency manipulator for the last six months\nAccording to the criteria established by\nThe act of Congress that set up this process they actually were of just briefly there are three criteria that any country needs to meet in order to qualify for that scarlet letter\nThat scarlet letter of currency manipulator status and China is really met just one in the last six months since the last such treasury report came out it runs a norm of bilateral trade surplus with the U.S no one can no one can test that but it's\nActually been a net seller of us that\nFor the the last few months we just got the latest treasury data that goes through August actually yesterday [noise]\nAnd it's also it's also brought down its global current account surplus which is a broad measure of its trade surplus pretty considerably in the last few years or so again by by two of the three criteria China is in fact not manipulating\nI ask you garden because you've been keen on this story for some time or the president when a candidate and in transition accused China of currency manipulation was that accurate then is it accurate now\nIt ... it has not been accurate for at least a year and a half maybe two years maybe even more than that clearly China was a currency manipulator in other words it was manipulating the value of its currency to obtain a train but trade benefit it did that\nUm by keeping the renminbi low but we also know hum as Alan just alluded to that they've actually been supporting their currency recently and the reason is as Alan points out just because they're worried about capital flight and if the remedies that are low value that encourages capital flight and so\nOver the last six months of the people's bank of China the central bank has actually been selling dollars in order to support the renminbi\nYes the remedy is falling but it would have flown a lot more but for the support from the Chinese central authorities\nAnd that to my own educated here on this sounds like if not manipulation certainly putting your thumb on the ... yeah they\nDo but there are some on the scale John ... it's not currency manipulation as defined in US law because to be a currency manipulator for purposes of this treasury designation\nYou've got to fool around with the value of your currency in order to obtain a trade benefits and they have not done that matter of fact they'd give it a trade benefit to our exporters by keeping their currency artificially\nHigh Allen for those of us who don't practice macro economics the way Allen tunnel Senate reality check does why none of us walk to the economics like Allen tunnels why why why just currency manipulation happened ... who has it who uses it and why\n... countries that rely heavily on exports for the growth like China or frequently tempted and often to carry through the policy of artificially depressing the value of their currencies which makes their goods cheaper these heavy foreign competitors in their own market\nIn the U.S market and then third country markets and in fact\nOver the last roughly Twenty years several countries have been designated\nBy the by the Treasury Department as currency manipulators hum and certainly in this latest report various countries or or put on an informal watch list given a so called stern warning not to go too far\nDown the road that they seem to be going on although no one's really sure no one's actually willing to make that accusation formally but\nIt has been used China as Gordon says certainly used that massively especially from the midnight\nUsed to the uh well really to right before the the global financial crisis\nBut the situation has changed but was what's also changed dramatically is that this currency manipulation issue in the age of Trump's trade policy no longer matters the way it did ten years ago because the president has already imposed so many tariffs\nOn Chinese imports and is likely I think now to impose many many more so the importance of tariffs to counter currency manipulation has really shrunk\nI'm terribly disappointed Allen that we do not violently disagree on this issue you know I I don't know how that happened that we actually have the same perspective\nLet's go to another issue where we might disagree okay and that is supply chains there's a lot of people out there Allen who say look you know the supply chains are stuck in China it will never ever change agree or disagree\nWait I Want to crowd in with the economist conventional wisdom from lousy economy oh gosh look guys

[noise]\nI'm John ... with my friend Gordon Chang garden there was these political out foreign affairs by the executive\nEditor and it was a compilation of all that we know about the troubles in China centered around Xi Jinping the president for life\nAnd it gave a glimpse of where we are and where we could be moving at rationalizing textbook hated why China is failing why the disappointment\nAnd it's pointed to human nature and that drew me in because that goes everywhere it's not just China human nature is when there is a dictatorship or an authoritarian ... there is an incentive to deceive\nBecause your job your family your ambition your dreams depend upon you giving information that is favorable to the success of the regime\nYou're no longer in a position or department or an enterprise in these vast things called that the state has composed the state operated enterprises you're no longer in a position to say\nThere's going to be a shortfall this quarter or we don't have adequate quality control or the failure here is because we have toxic managers who have to be educated\nYou don't do any of that anymore and what that does is it creates and the Communist Party\nAnd an enormous silence around she in which he gets no good information except from a handful of his lieutenants who not even then John and the information is about who's against us because that's what they become good at worrying about\nWorrying about the man who's going to get them in the back what happened in late Soviet Union was it became brittle and paranoid that the description of a nightmare\nAnd there's history to say that that's where China's head [noise]\nThere's a lot of history and much of it is Chinese history and much of that is history of the People's Republic because\nWhat we're seeing today in Beijing which you just described is absolutely correct that there is the silence that there is an inability to disagree inability to tell the truth to your superiors and so what's happened to see jumping is just not getting the information that he needs in order to make reasonable decisions\nThe same thing happened amounts of drugs in the late Nineteen fifties you ended up with something called the great leap forward which was an insane plan to start out with\nBut it was made even worse and the tragedy is that tens of millions of Chinese died\nBig impart not only because it's at the mouth was just a loony in terms of his policies\nBut also because he did not understand what was actually happening peasants were starving and at the same time he was told by those around him that the great leap forward his plan was actually working so we're seeing the same dynamic\nMaybe not with tens of millions of people dying now but clearly it's the same phenomena\nThe concern also is that in\nA deteriorating security condition which is what you are when you're paranoid and there is no satisfaction right you that no matter how many times you both the door\nThey can get in another way your imagination takes over and a deteriorating security situation it becomes very attractive for the regime to lash out and find out of me\nOh certainly and many people speculate that right now to Jim things at a place where he understands that a couple of things are happening first of all he is in security does need to have a foreign enemy\nBut also in a general sense China is starting to perceive a closing window of opportunity because you have an economy which is not growing as advertised\nYou also have a demography which is going to turn negative fairly soon edited environment that can no longer support the economic growth that we saw in the Nineteen eighties Nineteen nineties so clearly there is a time where Chinese leaders are starting to think\nThat they've got to accomplish what they're set out to do now or they're never going to be able to do it\nIn late dictatorship and this was the Soviet Union there is no succession plan brush enough to not have a succession plan which is why state security stepped in and drop off made himself the boss she does not have a succession plan state security or the pale law will run China after she\nYes and that's the optimistic scenario the other scenario is just that uh the basically the party and the state dissolved and you have a period of uncertainty and turbulence and chaos and that has occurred in previous times in China's history so\nThat could occur as well but you're absolutely right Xi Jinping has no succession plan and because of the way that he's changed the Communist Party he's the institutionalized at gotten rid of the rules of succession he can't have a successor because if he does he's gone\nIn a late dictatorship the Soviet Union a coup is less likely than indifference\nIndifference there was eventually a coup but it was because corporate chef raised expectations I at this point I Do not believe that she is vulnerable to a coup he is however suffering

I mean it's it's it's got pretty much what we need\nA if we're going to stage a naval operations there now by the same token I mean the simply having the idea of having the former enemy the United states coming back\nTo a former U.S facility in Vietnam is obviously something that the Vietnamese government has a rather sensitive to because of every ... about the Vietnam War and they have to be to be mindful of that kind of like\nOK gym near Vietnam's a country called Singapore um US Navy also pose in Singapore every once in a while even though we don't have a mutual defense treaty Singapore is also the players were Madison's going or is actually going to after leaving Vietnam\nAnd in Singapore is his Chinese counterpart\nUm the defense minister and that's the same defense minister who would not see 'em a couple of weeks ago in Beijing so mad is canceled his trip to China but he is seeing the Chinese defense minister in a few hours tell us what you know about that\n[noise] you know what I Do about it is very little what I Would get speculated about a quite a bit okay speculate yeah yeah well it's I mean it's\nIt's a truly fascinated to see such a quick pivot from from China it's been of course as we talked about the last time when I was on we saw a bit of this happened right in here in Newport we're having our ah international sea power symposium the head of the Chinese and they'd be what's here and actually pull and actually pulled out and went home\nIt displeasure over the situation in the south China Sea he was recalled to to to Beijing\nSo that so that was sort of the origin of what we see having that we'll see happening in Southeast Asia now and of course it seems like a try that has had second thoughts as said it's the defense minister to this defense ministers conference between the United states and Ozzie on\nIn Singapore and uh\nSo I did I I'm not I'm not sure exactly who gets the upper hand diplomatically but it's a fascinating to watch\nJim I'm told that the Chinese believe regard or an article of faith especially for the Chinese military and the ... that the south China Seas are Chinese and that the U.S his poaching and that just as we do not permit\nRussian or Chinese\nShips in the Gulf of Mexico they do not intend to a permit us ships are our allies in the south China Sea can they enforce that\nUh well ... well I guess I'll take the ... things that are the second thing I Would answer first I guess that's really where the rubber meets the road is kind of do they have the assets do they have the uh the material the missiles or craft all that kind of stuff to actually enforce their claims\nIn the south China Sea if indeed they interpret this as sovereign territory of seems to be the one coming out of Beijing for the past few years they talk about indisputable sovereignty meeting a monopoly of force that belongs to China in the waters the claim so\nWhether it has the bullets to enforce that I guess we're amazed\nSeen as far as the historical person I mean it's it's in a sense it makes some sense of the big powers of big powers like the United states like Russia or China like India in fact\nWhen they look offshore they do have a proprietary says towards those waters but at the same time if you look at what China is doing today in the show to see what the United States that of the Caribbean and the Gulf during the era of the Monroe Doctrine yes there were they just both dishes claimed assert prerogative but\nCertainly the United states that require to own the Caribbean to own the Gulf to own all the islands with than there are basically to to make the rules in Washington governing what happened in those expanses so it might be the same thing but it's an order of magnitude greater in an ambition\nAnd to reinforce your point gym um it was just a couple of years ago when the Chinese sale within ten miles of an Alaskan island we didn't stop them um we didn't complain about it\nSo you know if the Russians are the Chinese wanted to say on the Gulf of Mexico our position would be yeah go right ahead um less because we believe in freedom of navigation and I think that you know the Chinese always say well they could never sailed near Hawaii well we allow them to do that if they want to if they have the capability to\nIt's just that of course we don't like it but we don't stop them from it\nI mean we're with initially it was really sort of but that's what they were used to it I mean there was\nJust a moment Jim Will get you back on the phone 'cause I Want to hear we had to break up their Gordon I ... I Want you to go over that point again that the Chinese aggression here that we're seeing\nIs building gradually it has been building for every for many years and in the course of this conversation Jeanette\nI see that we've come to accept a certain claim a certain amount of claims and the Chinese were contending with them we're talking history\nBut I think that's true for for more than just the United states I think the our European allies have accepted that the aggression in the south China Sea I'm even beginning to believe that parts of East Asia have accepted it\nWell I think parts of East Asia might have accepted it but no I mean we don't accept a Chinese territorial claims and that's why we had the Decatur of engaging the freedom of navigation operation a last month and that's because we do this we do this not only in the south China Sea but elsewhere\nAnd although you know we take the position that the United states will not arbitrator take a position on competing ... sovereignty claims were were not involved nonetheless we insist on an open global commons international airspace international water\nAnd Jim Jens back with us are we backed up by our allies on this gym will will they speak for us and an episode like the Decatur\nWell you know what I actually feel better about the situation than I did up to to really you know two or three years ago it's it it seemed like it was developing into a U.S China us on China thing I Wonder one mano a mano so I think what which I think is a really really bad situation if it happens\nHowever we've started we started to see the royal navy Britain's real David show up in the south China Sea the French the French were put around thinking presidents and talking about the way more uh Australia has been has been pretty stalwart on the whole thing so\nYeah I think there is I think there's I think our allies and our friends and and nations we would like to recruit to be ... or started to realize that you know every every state has a stake in freedom of the sea and that they'd better show up and they let her speak up about it in the south China Sea\nLets those rights go away at places like the Baltic Sea blacks

the John bachelor show [noise]\nI'm joined us or with Gordon Chang the Daily Beast my colleague can go home and we're very pleased welcome the Hoover Institution Michael off and writing most recently at the national review and\nAll their distinguish publications about aggression by the Chinese or leadership in Beijing the People's Republic of China\nThat appears just continuous with the reputation that China had gained as a diplomatic actor many years as remaining in the sidelines or emphasizing peaceful rise are seeking non conflict Michael a very good evening to you you cite several instances they're very well known now\nChina forcing the airlines to remove Taiwan from its Web sites or China challenging the USS Decatur in the south China Sea or most recently you've written about China detaining up to the New York times tells us\nA million leaguers in reeducation concentration camps\nThis new aggression does it come from one place Michael good evening to you\n[noise] good evening John well you know does it come from one place and in one way it does it comes from ... the president of China now\nHe's obviously the beneficiary of years of policies that have strengthened China but in his five now six years in power or he has moved assertively and indeed in many cases aggressively to throw off the caution that China had traditionally practice or at least have practiced\nIn the past several decades towards the outside world and you're seeing a China that is unapologetic\nThat is unwilling to compromise that is unwilling in many cases to negotiate a and in\nIn fact what I think it's doing is beginning to push itself into a\nCorner but it's not doing so without causing a lot of pain and a lot of disruption abroad\nMichael um see jumping is very different from his predecessor Hu Jintao who is a consensus builder mild\nQuite weak politically or see jumping is just apparently the polar opposite um do you think see jumping is an aberration or is he the inevitable result of the evolution of Chinese communism\nOr it's a great question you know as a historian I'm always are hesitant according to to make a conclusion like that and and you know the easy ways to punt and say that that will see but in in some cases we really are at a turning point if she ... paying is able to\nSuccessfully consolidated power and successfully pushed through the um uh the types of policies that he has been doing so far meaning they're not\nThey're not reverse that it's hard to see China going\nGoing back a short of of course the type of collapse scenario or severe weakening that both of us have talked extensively about\nOn the other hand if it turns out that he missed calculates that he creates a coalition of the willing so to speak that is opposing China if he'd blunders into a conflict that China's not prepared for\nThen you can easily see a lot of this being unwound and he and his\nApproach being disavowed by those who would replace him so in in some ways what he's fighting for I Would say is not just China's role in the global stage he's he's actually fighting for the future of China when he talks about the China Dream is he's done since coming into power\nWhen he talks about rejuvenating the great Chinese people what he's really talking about is this pathway and we are in the midst of that experiment right now\nYou know will clearly you're seeing a pushback from the United states and from neighbors in from other countries\nAnd this is I think causing some political distress because we've had the ... way um incident the president have been a ... ... be recalled and disappeared I'm there have been other instances suggesting political distress at the top um infighting we don't know the full dimension of it\nUm but it seems that see jumping is fighting not only for the future of China but he seems to be also fighting as you suggested earlier to consolidate his political position in Beijing because otherwise we wouldn't be seeing the symptoms come so soon after each other\nI think that's right um now\nOne of the things that he's done assiduously since coming into power in late twenty twelve and probably before that when he was the heir apparent was to begin isolating and eliminating potential other sources are centers of power within a the top leadership of of the Chinese government um so it's not that he did\nNot understand that he would cause antibodies so to speak to come to form and and try to either blunt what he's doing or or you know displace him and\nTake it over for themselves and he's been very successful in doing that with the military and doing it with\nThe media which has already controlled or in clamping down on civil society and the like but you are absolutely seeing signs of I'm I'm not unrest but dissatisfaction in China are there are a you know in the Soviet Union we have to use to have these ... dot underground publications in China they will\nCome pop up here and there on the Internet and then spread like wildfire there are extreme criticisms of him and the the path that he's taking a you see a some concern in the top leadership as you mentioned of course the Interpol chief Chinese are being disappeared this is this is a regime I don't know if I'd\nSay that the wheels are coming off I don't think it's it's at that level but it is is absolutely one where Xi Jinping has pushed so far so fast\nThat there is the beginnings of a push back against that the question is has he been successful enough in neutering potential other centers of power that he will be able to get through this\nYou mentioned the national review on line three hundred and fifty thousand Chinese students studying in America are they a problem Michael that is developing this escalation of aggression is that turning those students into ... unhappy people are unhappy visitors to the United states\nWell obviously it's it's hard to you know you can't\nGeneralize about all three hundred and fifty thousand but what we can talk about John hard the undeniable actions on the part of the Chinese government to mobilize in some cases weaponized the students they've done it lessen the United states but they've done it in places like Australia and other countries where they form\nA very vocal interest blocks a and they try to suppress anti Chinese discussion or Chinese um lectures or Chinese events on\nCollege campuses uh they will go out as as large crowds trying to drown out anyone who is taking a critical stance of China they\nAre in other element along with the Confucius Institute so that the state uses to try to portray only positive a positive views of China now in the United states but we also know is that the government is very carefully watching them that there are\nHigh and evening John well I I Will take that question it's split it into two\nI think that voters who are living this booming economy on the ground to every day in terms of job opportunities job creation\nIn terms of wage growth uh watching their four one case expand looking at the booming stock market thing opportunities exploded every direction\nI think they understand\nWho is to be credited with us and that is the president of the United states and his party who issued in tax cuts\nMassive deregulation\nOr renegotiate it the the trade deals that we are killing large sectors in this country economically and unleashing the energy sector so we think folks\nOn the ground normal American to understand this because they are getting the benefits of this booming economy every single day and the opportunities are only increasing in their eyes and and in terms of what they're experiencing\nOn the other hand the Republicans running for election or re election in the house the Senate governors et cetera\nI don't think that they have been particularly effective in getting this message across now it may not matter because again the economy is so strong that voters are seeing it again in every direction so\nBut but I think it's political malpractice\nFor the Republicans not to be touting the economy and their responsibility for it at every turn they tend to Democrats are guilty of this too I mean they they tend to get lost in their own storylines or what every story lines are created it defined for them by the press\nThey tend to get lost in those things I you and I've been talking about this for months I Wish that the Republicans had been counting the economy and their role in creating this pool every single day right up to the day of the election\nThey have not done that so I Am disappointed in most of the candidates but I still think that the American people are going to deliver them a better day on election day that most people think but it's not entirely because Republicans have been so great at their own messaging\nThe New York times reports that after Kavanaugh and these last week that there is evidence that the Republicans have gained because of the polarizing of the ... electorate over issues like capital and others in other words they're stronger in red states the Republicans than they were before\nAnd while the Democrats are stronger in blue states hardly anybody's left in the middle America except for maybe Elizabeth Warren wandering around trying to figure out what she is but the polarization means that both bases are fired up both places remember the story for a year was that only the Democrats were focused\nRight yes and that was true and Republicans were so self satisfied after the twenty sixteen election that a lot of them in a lot of voters who are particularly passionate about politics just sort of kickback didn't watched what was unfolding which for them was pretty good especially economically\nBut now John I think given the Kavanaugh situation which spectacle debacle that was how horrifying that was just so many voters not just Republican base but independence and the disaffected Democrats who voted for Trump twenty sixteen\nThey took a look at this it said what the heck is going on here this is a good man this is a brilliant man who deserves to be on the Supreme Court elections have consequences the country elected Trump Trump's prerogative is\nNominated he'd like to sit on the Supreme Court and unless they're Charles Manson that person to deserve to be on the courts so what is going on with the ...\nBig level that this guy that got a lot of people across the board really mad it got that mobilized\nSo the question is whether or not that that energy and enthusiasm born out of the anger of the way Kevin always treated whether that can carry three to election day I think largely a cat obviously I think if the bitter kept it in the day after he was confirmed you would see\nMaybe a Republican landslide forget about a blue wave\nBut the timing of this is such a I I still think that it's close enough to the Kavanaugh spectacle that there will be enough Republican the energy to mitigate any blue wave\nRight it looks like a blue wave is of the blue a metaphor is no longer useful the times says that in polling shows than in the rural areas the Republicans are granting straight and for the way to be gigantic\nThe Democrats have to do well not only in suburbia they already have cities knowing suburbia but also in the rural districts and that's not happening at this time I wanted to buy this up the way up into house which political science says goes to the Democrats the party on on the out\nFor the first mid term of a president\nAnd the Senate I've been surprised Monica as the Senate numbers have come in and we're getting likely voters now\nHow strong the Republicans are in red states very very strong and that it will be a credit to such as Joe I'm Mr mentioned senator mentioned if he holds West Virginia\nThe Republicans are overwhelming in Missouri overwhelming so North Dakota overwhelming in Nevada overwhelming in Tennessee or they might even be overwhelming in Arizona I Can't tell this point but whatever that polarization dozens in suburbia you certainly successful for the Senate and\nYes exactly in fact the Senate map has really tilted in the ... favor just in the last couple of weeks I always thought that the Republicans were going to hold the Senate\nAnd maybe pick up the cedar chew now we're looking at I saw in the Dallas yesterday John that said that at those sort of the feeling we could pick up seven Senate seat I don't think that's likely\nBut now they've got the average of the Republicans picking up about three or even four maybe five Senate seats\nWhich is entirely possible so Mitch McConnell today made a comment about Obamacare\nAnd said look if if it turns out as we suspect it might where the where our party picks up a number of seats in the Senate\nWe're going to take another step repealing Obamacare which of course gets to be sold riled up all over again they were going to do and and and and go full charge to get this done what I went on social media especially I ... I saw the left going bananas over\nWhat kind of caught at both sides are trying to use it in order to generate turned out on election day but remember John it a lot of these key states early voting is already and\nThey're already voting Monica I've saved the this to last because it's your story and there's more to say but Hillary Clinton Monica it's ... it's just astonishing to me that Hillary Clinton\nSpeaks about what happened in Nineteen Ninety eight with Monica Lewinsky as if it's as if it's it happened in another universe and it's not even connected to the world we live in\nA Hillary Clinton in this last week I think embarrassed the Democratic party if they're paying attention are they\n[noise] it definitely is Mrs Clinton never ceases to amaze\nIt uh John I mean it's unbelievable she made a comment today that that her husband did not it quote abuse power when engaged in not affair with Monica Lewinsky her husband at the time was forty nine\nHe knew he was the boss and by the way the president of the United states she was twenty two and a White House and turn\nThe whole concept of a feminist argument on this especially in the meat to era\nIs that that power differential is overwhelming that it was it abuse of power it would have textbook abuse of power and yet this is Clinton get not seemed to twenty five years later process what her husband did to her to miss Lewinsky into the country\nI after all of this time she hipster wagon\nTo him years ago like forty forty five years ago to try to get the presidency that failed and you can still see the sets of denial at her actually quite sad\nMonica Crowley the London Center for policy research days to go to the mid term I'm John bachelor this is the John ... show\n[noise]\n\n\nYou will any money to the IRS you need to call star star one two three four star star one two three four Uncle Sam has the power to make your life miserable you could stop the IRS collections process right now by calling stars STAR One two three four when you call the tax defense\nCenter you'll get free information on how you can reduce your back taxes including penalties interest star star one two three four star star one two three four could save you thousands on your back taxes you could also be helped if you have an\nFound returns attack saline wage garnishment bank levy or if you've entered into a payment plan and can't make the payments it's your hard earned money stop Uncle Sam right now make the\nCall that could help you and the worry today star star one two three four star star one two three four star star one two three four\nA third or ethnic ... including come and they uh himself a spiritual leader is is that ethnic either by Johnny and so Iran yell at the breakup of the Soviet Union it was very clear from a number of speeches articles looked at the map and said ... [noise]\nA rising nationalism independent Azerbaijan not sound good for my own ethnic Azerbaijan these I'm going to support the other guy in the war and again this is almost counter intuitive if you think that Iran foreign policy is motivated by slum or you know ... some kind of solidarity issue so\nDuring the war between Armenian Azerbaijan the border between Iran and Armenia was open\nFuel supplies food supplies um went from\nFrom Iran into Armenian and and the sense Armenia was able to sustain the war I'm like you know that that that open border with Iran with was very important and I assume that um during the national ... national security adviser John Bolton upcoming\nVisit yeah that is a very convenient ... the John Bolton is headed into the region to be a year a van and at ... correct\nAnd Georgia and actually Russia which is kind of a complicated visit together to go from Moscow to you know to these three countries that that border uh that that that are very relevant to uh both Russia and any run\nOut and pipeline colleges and very very much because the pipeline if I could get it correctly\nA brand new is to run from Baku south of ... through Georgia to the black sea and then through turkey into bypass Armenia entirely so they're being left out of the major pipeline that that is on that as a vet that has announced that that has been knitted together with the announcement\nOf the Caspian Sea bass and joining into that pipeline\nWill you know I mean I think again it's a it's a choice of uh our meat you know Armenia obviously when there's a war going on and there's snipers and there's minds you know you can build you can't build pipelines but\nUm you know clearly if there was peace in the region this would create a lot more opportunity economic opportunities for media or as as well\nBe the question here now is Iran pending these sanctions that are coming on\nIs it possible for wrong to bypass the sanctions entirely and do it without transparency using Armenia I Know that this would be a way this would be a Russian work around\n[noise] um I don't you know the I don't think it can solve all of the Ron's problems they'll certainly not um ... with oil exports but\nI think for instance something more troubling even that Armenia itself is actually a the region of the gonna call by which our media captured from Azerbaijan and it and it it ... it plays a game where it says that well we're not you know that's\nGoing to call back we're not responsible for what happens there [noise]\nUm when although I've been I've been there and there's Armenian troops there um the two previous presidents of Armenia come from the gonna call by some people serving the met from Armenia serve in the military there it's clearly part you know under Armenian uh control right now\nUm but certainly banks and other systems there could could be used because it isn't ungoverned territory and in general\nThese are probably these ungoverned territories or what we're we're no for the real ... or the real ... real country that controls that territory it doesn't take responsibility are some of the biggest you know black holes and dangerous elements in the international system\nAnd I visited you as you well know I visited the front lines of ... last summer and I'm told that there's an arm their dinners and as I was there by John enclave on the other side of ... that wedge between Armenia in Iran is that a\nProblem or a solution for the region that Azerbaijan sits there with territory\nBetween these two romances as or um Iran and Armenia\nYeah no I think it actually creates a vulnerability fries or by John because it's that extra clay that's part of its territory but it has no ... no territorial continuity so it is dependent on either of flights into the region um or coming\nAnd I come into the region you abide by bus from turkey from eastern turkey um uh but but yet the region is dependent for instance also on 'em it's got supplies from Iran which is done in this in a swap with a\nA gas that either by John supplies to to northern Iran so yeah I think that it it ... you know it complicate uh the region even more but I think it's very important for us to learn\nThan we tend to try to think well who who's allies with who and that somehow religion or ideology will play a role and I think the case of Armenian uh in in the Iran is sort of the greatest proof you know to be but this idea that\nUm religion plays a role or in in choosing the alliances\nYes this looks like an alliance of expediency a ... a professor

Ross cosmos extremely carefully and we're going to learn a lot in these coming days\nAbout to tell you I remember we depend upon so he was completely until it if\nThere is an alternative capsule to be launched from the United states completely to reach I assessed there's a crew on board right now\nThere are due for rotation they might extend them there's also the possibility that the IOC says we'll be unmanned for some period in the future until so uses solved\nAnd it totally is the author of Russia in space the past explained the future explored his book on Ross cause most always need a new chapters and it's only a very good evening to you I understand\nThat they've reached the crash site you're reporting on October eleventh what is emerge so far from the explanation from Ross cause most about the failure good evening to\nA fellow John um I think we're fortunate with the in the way and with this faith or because of the many of the details became um a kind of clear almost immediately\nSo essentially on the VCR or the launch you could see that uh that was one of the booster step out on the failed to a separate cleanly separated but uh\nIt was kind of a little delay and of course some space business even a few seconds of delay a means a big trouble for the kids and when it's well in fact now we have a role for him the date that that second to sit by that you have to I was a collision bits in this empty boosts or\nOne of the four ...\nAnd the main stage which was still fight and then we're still working a kid named the spacecraft to orbit and of course once it hits\nA there was a fatal blow to the operational a stage and as it is all the rockets a bit too much uh started going off course\nAh fortunately the flight control systems detected this apt to wait that emergency escape for the ... and that's why they still can give interviews and uh basically to lift the failed it failed to us\nSo the abort system works David\n... and it totally I ... I read some place that um there was a failed signal big that didn't work to give him a good separation\nAnd they were looking into um non technical reasons and said other people were investigating that implying that maybe it was on purpose or sabotage or something do you know anything about that\nOh well we have I think much simpler and kind of a more reasonable explanation of this was out uh was I was going up to the ... and stuff like that and got spirit assist\nOr because I think first of all we know from the ... or that there was a very similar accident in Nineteen Ninety six when that particular signal you mentioned that not that he should the booster in time and there was no uh ... as well\nAnd those were found a ... from that investigation that was a damage to the sense of self which could happen\nNatural way just because of the same but it's a very sensitive ... which is kind of a better than the people the booster and if you're not careful enough to do it in that somebody you can very easily or not damage that's the way to kind of delicate the structure and then it's\nA it's a actual mechanical or elements which needs to move during the ... and then that it\nSends the command for this special wealth doping on it and if it doesn't do that sometime in time with it you can create big trouble for for the rocket them that's I think exactly what's happened to the side\nAnd are we looking at protocols that needs to be change do you have a wonderful pictures on on your website Russian space Web of the assembly the preparation of a sudden has MS ten the failed craft or do they are they looking at the protocols right now for where how they miss this and quality control\nAbsolutely as they look in the entire chain of procedures which led to this and say they get to\nA tell us exactly what was the source of fruit cause of this but they tell us that they do understand the process they do understand what happened and uh the only thing left the ... the kind of to establish this entire sort of very ... cause which which caused that\nAnd I think that their way to close from they're confident that it can be a critic\nDavid I'm ... and it totally does NASA play any role and in this investigation and oversight given American astronaut ride on this or used to what what does NASA do or do they just wait decisions coming out of Russia\nI think in many cases like this they they kind of weight but they will obviously will have all the\nTechnical reports which will come out from the investigation and they will definitely will be able to give getting light them they will be able to kind of give feedback whether they feel confident enough to death on out back on a you know and the next up a launch was the crew\nAnd it totally there are there are demands for use and to to to and from highest asked have you seen a schedule changes in any fashion after this accident\nUm there is a slight change which might take place because in fact to Iowa Nicolas they might actually odds once the next launch a forward because uh because what's going on is there is right now the international space station is under stuff\nSays that the new law says the new laws have been sent to Fifteen million households to raise public awareness of this change of legal status for cannabis\nJoining me is Brian aside he's the C. E. O. of a company that's ready for the transformation of Canada with legalization of marijuana for recreational use this is green organic dutchman holdings or it's listed on the stock exchanges T God T. G. O. D.\nAnd a Bryan was in New York on Bloomberg to make the announcement of this new company now legal in Canada and its ambitions Brian a very good evening to you thank you for this and congratulations\nFirst of all how was it on television was everybody laughing in the studio where they were they joyous Sarah there have been the anticipation for quite some time good evening to\nTheir ... thanks for having me on yes there was definitely a lot of it just station that's really historic day for Canada I think everyone's feeling very excited still very early days um but Canada's providing leadership to the world by making a product that's helping people and has widespread use legal\nUm that's encouraging kind of better consistent quality\nI'm adding legitimate employment to the the country as well as increasing the tax base reducing crime and relate a statement this ... this isn't a new category this has been around forever\nOn people and using candidates for for thousands of years um it's being more this past century where where it's being illegal um and now people are starting to to recognize the benefits of it\nAnd and especially the benefits of legalization in terms of um keeping it out of the hands of miners in peace in the tax base making sure you've got that are consistent product so we take our very proud to be a part of it and really congratulations to everyone who helped make it happen\nYes and I'm certain that take an update the new NAFTA to include a marijuana being important in the United states has become an important part of the north American Trade Organization now what is the God when we spoke earlier in the year\nYou were building very large facilities because your aim as I recall it is to ... is to produce cannabis that can be used in animals and in that bridge is is that correct\nUm that's why we see a lot of growth coming from edibles and divergence but we'll be having products across all the different particles depending on how people want\nTo consume it will be providing those kinds of products but really focused on on clean and organics were growing and real soil we don't use any synthetic fertilizers or chemical pesticides such a cleaner healthier product that has a sharper chirping kind of flavors and profile\nUm that that consumers prefer now in terms of ... we were building those facilities were still building them are Hamilton facility and Ontario\nWill be finished by the end of this calendar year and we'll start selling into the medical market in January\nSo we're actually not selling today in Canada yet we have sales in Europe in before we do in Canada um and then in ... back our facility will be finished next summer but even before then as we start building each grow room will will start cultivating and harvesting so we expect to be expanding all started medical and Canada and Henry\nAnd then during next year will be expanding across more medical patients and then province by province in the recreational adults use market but we've actually made a lot a lot of progress since we last talked\nOn we've purchased a company now in Poland temp Poland which has industrial hemp based CBD oils and from there are selling into multiple countries across Europe\nWere investing in this business to actually take some of the technologies we've been developing in Canada or have licensed out of the U.S\nAnd we'll be expanding our product portfolio exactly into edible as you mentioned and beverages being on the oils they sell today\nAnd since we last talked we've also acquired a company in Jamaica or fifty percent of a company in Jamaica you can't have majority ownership there we've we've got forty nine percent\nAnd this is a fully vertically integrated company everything from cultivation to extraction manufacturing in retail stores um we made an announcement last week that we've entered into a joint venture and Mexico which is one of the biggest markets in Latin America\nAnd we'll be exporting products from Poland from Canada and and from Jamaica into Mexico and then soon to be the rest of Latin America we're also investing and building the sales and distribution infrastructure so really we're on track to to build out our global brand\nAnd become the leading organic candidates Brent I'm In the world\nI Want to ask about that the facility and come back that's twenty thousand square feet is that where the robots are Brian is that you're going to use a robot arm or so\nIn ... no ... in in Hamilton it's it's a hundred and fifty thousand square feet twenty thousand is the indoor part I'm In valley feel just outside of a Montreal and conduct that's actually one point one million square feet and twenty thousand\nSo it's much much bigger and yes it will be largely automated we've we actually chose cut back because it has the lowest power rates in the country uh-huh hum as well as some it's great\nThat so that's where the robot farmers will be in Quebec ... that's right\nSo you don't have people in the grow rooms um which which has a number of benefits because it it's a lower risk of contaminants coming in Raj tends to happen when people are coming in and out and then on top of that because you got robots to lift up the tables you do need walkways for people\nWhere are the stores to look for and if and how are they how are they managed\nGoing to take a bit of time I meet today you only have a couple dozen stores across the country um what you'll find is over the next months and over the next year they'll be more and more retail stores opening up they'll be very specific only selling cannabis products\nWith the exception of Nova Scotia where they're selling it and liquor stores as well\nUm but you if you're in Canada you can order online have it delivered to your hotel um you need to sign for it and you to be of age which is basically Nineteen every province except for about keeping to be Eighteen to purchase it and I'm In\nIn Ontario um there's a lot of American states a lot of big population um adjacent Ontario it won't be until next April you'll be able to find it in retail stores\nAnd come back for for states that are neighboring um come back um they do have some stores now but I think over the next few months will be a lot more stores and they'll be better accessibility\nAnd the government is handling slower go the understand you gotta start somewhere today's the start date so they're now going to build a the government is handling the the merchandise as wholesalers correct and then there are opportunities for private enterprise to sell it as retailers\nUm that's right so for the medical market which has been in place for some time I'm it's direct\nPatient directly to the producer through e commerce so we can sell to medical patients across the country but for recreational adults use um the the provincial government in each and every province is the wholesaler record\nSo we sell to the province\nAnd then they go on and sell to retailers whether it's their own retailers like in in the back and\nAnd and several other provinces or private retailers like Alberta or Ontario as of next April will have a private retail network um the government will still be kind of in the middle there ensuring the right quality and then re controls and excise taxes everything else are collected\nUm and ah and also create a getting cutting their wholesale markup as well\nThere I mean the the the promises when I'm from a financial standpoint as well as right hum reducing crime and and making sure that that the tax basis is strong and and there's quality products out there\nThere is that getting this to the way the BBC is reporting this have you heard from your neighbors in Britain or they have they expressed their envy because of what's going on in Canada\nI I Would say I would have heard from people across all countries in Europe and in fact in in the U.S as well and and South America everyone is looking to Canada I'm being the first kind of significant or G. seven country right to have legalized adults use\n'em and want to make sure that candidate better right and I think what you'll find it more and more countries see the benefits\nUm in terms of providing um basically helping people 'cause I mean there's a lot of medical benefits to it but even if you compare it to the average alcohol I'm On the recreational side um it's also a healthier alternative\nAnd um I think you'll see more and more countries looking at Canada as a role model and looking at how they could replicate it\nThe company is a has an unusual a name on the on on the market T. G. O. D. but it is green organic document holdings Brian ... is the c._e._o. and this is the first day of legal legal\nCannabis in Canada there'll be many more details to Philly and it eventually will become\nAs ordinary as all the other entertainment's that are available for Americans and for Canadians and from Mexicans and the whole world you why because the tax base why that's why I'm John

in and the test drive confirmed as the book was a very slow diver she took about five minutes to get completely under which is way too long for a submarine that has to use a\nOf a mid to be able to dive to to escape attack it's way too slow so that was the problem and then he had to whatever's going to get him he had to see a way before\nYou get close enough that he couldn't get on that was the first thing but then then he found out when he got up off of the federal islands and the and he did have to dive in a hurry you lost control boat he couldn't get it wouldn't go wonder and heavy seas bowl was\nJust too big and too boy and he just couldn't get us to go in this area that you tried to drive it under by a larger dynamics going overhead forward and down the bell planes and plug the bells tanks just literally driver under and he lost control of it\nAnd it handled very badly the whole time and in no ... no fashion was this is the were the ... they were all at risk out there did they know that at the time\nWell they found out when they went to see they didn't they [laughter] they didn't know where they live skill they were assured by corrupt\nAs his boat as well designed as a you know it's just a great big crater that goes underwater is act like any of the submarine but then when they got out in the ocean and they found out and heavy seas when they're on their on the boat was had a\nLot of things wrong with it first of all it was built on the cheap you know there was nothing even the engines of drove that boat engines the diesel and use\nThey weren't they weren't propulsion engines like man diesels were in the big ... those were diesel generators are used on servers ships for auxiliary power on the ship and the electric motors were not a propulsion motors either\nThey were just oversized a commercial electric motors they used on cranes and talk equipment and stuff like that but it would take you know they work but they didn't move very quickly or\nMaximum speed on the surface was nine point five notes which is very slow\nYou know that it was under power this diesel was electric power so they built a ship like it was like a lumbering freighter has what it was an right it really wasn't meant to spend much time underwater it was to be a to invade the British\nOr the royal navy defenses and to reach America with the cargo hold so and there was no escort and the British knew it was coming a that was a detail you provide us that the\nUh the British and we we know enigma is famous for uh the of the British getting a hold of the ability to to read German naval traffic and the second war but they did it in the first war as well they they had the code buck ... book a ...\nIn all three of them at and and did they know that I did the British Royal Navy no that ... was it the\nOh sure they do are they in fact um she like all you broach she when she went north about keeping in mind this is a navy boat and and there when they were when they left\nHarvard and when they return picture when they left hell go on returned held alone they performed just like your regulars German U boats before they have the radio their location and time departure when they left than when they were about\nAfter maximum radio ... about two hundred miles they set up position report at a time so that they would the Germans were new release they got that\nFar and the admiral see in room forty which was their code breaker heard all of that\nOh sure they did and they pay you know they had a radio direction they try and they know where she was and then of course she went from that point she was on radio silence stop because they were being ... just ... it really would reach that far anymore so they were on the road\nThis is early summer evening and and Nineteen sixteen and we're headed to Baltimore we're headed to land in Baltimore and there's a spectacular a reception waiting by the detail here\nA blight mentions that they were looking to get supplies ten and rubber and especially nickel they needed all that because of the German blockade\nThey couldn't bring back food but Germany at this point is starving and you make note that the men in the front lines were very badly or were very badly fed and that would get worse in Nineteen Seventeen\nSo we're looking at all of Germany hoping that ... is ... it wasn't going to bring food but what would lift the sense of isolation is that what it would do\nWell what they were hoping that the people actually believed\nTo there's a lot of propaganda both foreign propaganda that is aimed at the United states primarily and there's a lot of internal propaganda aimed at the German people and they were Germans believe that they that\nThey they were going to bring back up

[noise] [noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show how much weight [noise]\nJon Benet Jon ... melodrama of the collapse of the hops or gum are Conrad is the general public tiara ... the general's son Joe since the eighty four year old\nMan who ruled by avoiding all problem and yet the war is upon them\nJeffrey ... a mad catastrophe as the book the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the ... empire there are plans general staff plans they've had maneuvers for years where they planned what will happen one more breaks out\nJeffrey there are two enemies that they must concerned themselves within the other one is the Russians the great Russian Empire from the north the other is Serbia but ... is a minor threat to Vienna marching on Serbia is a waste of time and money\nYou emphasize that when the Germans made common cause\nWhen Berlin made common cause with the end they always believed that\nThe Austrians would go to war with Russia that they would help the Germans whole Russia in the east while Germany destroyed France and the British expeditionary force in the west before they came back and finished it\nBut that the Austrians didn't tell Germany about the Serbian few is that correct\nWell I mean the the book talks a great deal about this in the sense that more good the younger helmet for the younger that the German journalist actually even Conrad the Austrian journalist that she had had intermittent staff\nTalks in the years before World War one they had a meeting and ate in Nineteen eighty nine there and meeting in Nineteen twelve where they talked about war plans but the warplanes were always very vaguely elaborated by both men for a couple of reasons for the Germans never trusted Austria Hungarian security arrangements and they were right\nNot to because the book talks and fascinating detail about the raid unfair Nineteen Thirteen when a when the uh when when when one of the best and brightest and the author Hungarian general staff\nIs discovered to have been selling German in Austria Hungarian war plans as well as you know ah information on Germany Austria Hungarian technology in fortress a provision arrangement and that sort of thing to the Russians\nAnd so the Germans always catch things close to the ...\nThe author Hungarians under Conrad also shared very little with the Germans Conrad actually had a rubber stamp on his desk and the general staff building that said not to be shared with the German general staff and he would stamp document for them\nAnd the reason they did this is that they both sides the Germans and the Austrians want it as much freedom of of the newer as they could and so they didn't want to commit themselves\nOr to definitely to each other because they wanted to maintain flexibility the Germans because they were they were nursing their sleep and plan and they were planning to throw a nearly their entire army against the British expeditionary force in the French and the west and then only once they were beaten move everything back to\nThe eighth they didn't want the country and saying hey you got to commit to leave that doesn't divisions are twenty divisions out east\nAnd the Austrians because they had this very flexible but will in theory war plan\nWhere they would have a large echelon of troops that wouldn't train for the for the Eastern Front they would have a ... a very small echelon of troops that were trained for the Serbian from ... in the event of a two front war and they would have a floating reserve it doesn't divisions\nThat couldn't trained for either from and uh the Austrians didn't want to have to nail down that floating reserve they you know because of German demand they wanted to have ultimate flexibility is it's so there was this\nVery a dangerous vagueness about the arrangements between the Germans and the Oscar Hungarians both general staff saw that as being convenient but it would prove fatal in war time as you see in the book\nBecause basically what happens is that uh the war basically is triggered by the fashion that assassination in Sarajevo and\nThe Austrians have an opportunity to math everything against Serbia because so great if the international outrage at this assassination I mean remember these Bosnian Serb assassins killed\nI don't print severe Austria Hungarian empire in the streets of Sarajevo these were Bosnian Serbs it was assumed by virtually every one that they had some kind of Serbian governments Serbian military connection this was telling the Austrians when they're all tomato and we're going to investigate improve up but\nIn the meantime everybody from St Petersburg across the London was horrified by the date so the Austrians actually had an opportunity to rule with everything into Serbia and crushed the Serbs but they wave to the opportunity wasted entire\nMonth the whole month of July they were all literally on vacation they didn't even come back to the end of the plan this war that they had been wanting for years there most of that time\nThey get around issuing an ultimatum a month after the assassination\nIndignation has ebbed away everywhere and now from St Petersburg London instead of people thinking hey Austria has a right to invade Syria everybody's thinking hey Austria it better not invade Serbia\nAnd and Russia and France are saying don't invade Serbia because Serbia has friends so at this point by the time the Austrians actually get around to going to war they no longer have the option of a one front war it's definitively going to be a two front war and yet and here's the madness of Conrad fun Hudson's or if\nHe decides to direct the bulk of the army south against the Serbs and send only\n... the other half of the army out to the Russians when in fact he needs to be sending forty divisions to face the Russians and ate divisions\nDown to face the Serbs but instead he spent twenty against the Serbs and um [noise] two and a\nTwenty eight against the Russian and they're not nearly enough for the Russians are going to build the strength of a hundred and Ninety six divisions\nThe three Army Corps that are sent against the Serbs are in the hands of tiara who is the rival of Conrad and ... he's even less effective as a commander and more hysterical as a man searching for victories and Conrad\nAnd what they what they wind up doing is trying to
