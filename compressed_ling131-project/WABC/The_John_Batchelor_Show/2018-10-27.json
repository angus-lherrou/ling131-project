that I Need help with so that's why lose ...\nWho writes at Fox News and the hill she's here to help me because the big number three point five percent sounds good Wall Street journal says strong I'm happy consumer spending sounds good but Liz\nThere's a hesitation here in the analysis connecting it to the Federal Reserve connecting it to the business environment your first response when you heard this number what ... what were you looking at where one of the strengths and weaknesses good evening to\nGood evening John well clearly three and a half percent was better than expected the expectations are more uh tempered at three three three point four percent not a huge difference but definitely on the upside\nUh and as you point out the the best news certainly was\nThe consumer which raised a because the spend about four percent more uh and that that was good news because consumer spending is really what's going to drive the fourth quarter obviously the holiday spending season is incredibly important that's where you get a huge amount of the yearly\nA consumer a lay out and that's going to be very good for retailers and so forth assuming there's no change and I don't see really see\nThat all the all the consumer data from the fed beige book\nEarlier this week and from this report is is very good that the element of the report that was not so good was a fall off from the second quarter in business investment and it was pretty dramatic and in fact a you know I think it was way\nLess than people expected and what's important about that is that business investment is expected to drive productivity gains and of course it's also a political issue that the Democrats have made much of the fact that corporations have gotten this big tax cut\nAnd the money is supposed to be going into building new plant and equipment just what we saw in the second quarter\nA but in fact uh it it didn't happen in the third quarter and so I think the question is is is a temporary blip this is a somewhat erratic series or is it a sign that the tariff discussions a wage price pressures all these kinds of things that are\nBeginning to strain corporate margins a little bit also showed up in deferred spending um so ...\nYou know the the question and it is important because if you don't see productivity improvements which we have not in almost a decade then you really make the case that wages wage growth is going to continue to be stuck in this very slow court or\nUm overall I think it's a little too early to assume that uncertainty about the trade battle has really put a ... in ... in a corporate spending think we have to wait another quarter to see whether that really manifests itself\nA and again we had a very big number I'm trying to remember exactly at these seems like almost close to eight percent in the second quarter so it's probably not so unexpected that you would get a downturn\nIn that yes that eight percent of the second quarter I'm told that includes the energy sector putting a lot of money into development because we're a super power and that that took it up way high\nAlso this point eight percent on the annual writers now appointed percent which means we're extremely extremely modest and the third quarter\nI'm told that that number is going to bounce around a lot we are going to get a second and third passive this so I'm I'm not I'm not putting a I'm not putting any I'm not putting down what you say I'm just puzzled here if we have a complete picture because we're concentrating just on one day\n... and there were some other ups and downs as well and the second quarter you had a real lack\nOf spending on inventories we sort of expected that to come back in the third quarter and pump up the overall number and I did on the other hand there was a big surge in exports are and the the trade deficit narrowed and the second quarter that helped GDP and conversely\nA ... with the widening of the trade deficit and the third quarter\nA hurt the growth rate over all that kind of balance it seemed to me in the second quarter those two things inventories and trade deficit sort of balance each other out and I think again in the third quarter what we ... you know bottom line there are a lot of things that the the other I should say the other weak point\nA was a residential fix construction\nOr you know home building is clearly being hurt by a higher mortgage rates higher interest\nRate shortage of supply the with the price the market especially for new buyers\nAnd but I think that I think the good news there at least if you kind of go back one step household formation numbers are still quite strong so at some point this is you know people have to live somewhere and I think this is a market I think this is an industry sector I should\nWhich in two thousand Nineteen could prove to be a source of strength for the overall economy because it is clearly lagging\nThe Federal Reserve project has guesses about what Nineteen and twenty are going to look like and this spring three point five percent which I'm told by Steve Moore\nA took a we we the gas prices took some points out of this may be up to a point three or ... so we're in a place where that that all of a sudden that gas bike\nHit the third quarter but the Federal Reserve production projects two point five and twenty Nineteen to point a to point zero in twenty Twenty one pointed in twenty Twenty one well they revise that now because of the three point five or they're going to stand pat on their gloomy this\nWell well I think they're\nGoing to probably continue to look at it at a\nDownturn ... I don't mean a recession but a downturn in terms of the growth rate ah I doubt that these numbers will change that I think the real issue confronting the fed is that inflation the price to later a inflation numbers generally are incredibly modest and so\nYou know the conversation that's kind of developing now is what is sort of the neutral rate\nAnd is it two percent is it more than two percent or because you know you look at where our rates are now and compare them to for example\nA German bonds three point three percent and ours are now\nWe're going to start in Eurasia and not erosion East Asia and the Pacific crest a very good evening to you\nThe twelve categories breakdown of quite logically I'll read through some of them everybody will recognize them this has to do with a ... in the environment human capital markets in innovation ecosystem I find in Asia and I call upon you\nAnd your experience that according to the competitive as competition Taiwan and Singapore Japan the Republican Korea and New Zealand are singled as singled out as doing well in innovation is that your experience good evening to\nLook good evening John ... absolutely what we see in those markets is a [noise]\nAn acceptance and a\n... an economic model whereby which research and development in research universities are key within those countries they embrace the human capital elements and do you see a larger portion of GDP going towards or indeed in innovation in ties between these\nPublic and private partnerships of the large companies in the large\nUniversities becoming a research centers to really kind of slingshot\nResearch into innovation into practical product to use\nTo look inside them because there are two more categories will mention them the emerging markets and then the ones that are very weak this is these days you but I Want to go inside this this is the fastest growing group on the planet in the solar system\nUh again Taiwan and Singapore\nOr Hong Kong Japan Republic of Korea and news a New Zealand\nInside this however there are strengths and weaknesses for example Korea is an innovation powerhouse because it spends as Chris just indicated four point two percent of its GDP on R and D but it's very weak in the labor market according to the global combat a news report\nAnd in products a product markets there's not much competition do you feel that in your work Chris\n... absolutely in in South Korea specifically you have the ... the eight large\nDominant companies in certain sectors\nAre the Korean government has set up or you would see is kind of two pillars so let's talk consumer televisions as an example we have Elgin Samsung is the two large competitors the south Korean economy is very much oriented towards a large companies working very closely with the government as you've seen with some of corruption problems there at times too\nClosely but the government having a direct invested a investment in support of those major employers in uh the basis of those employers having large employee bases and really helping to drive the economy for\nJapan which I Would have thought was perfect America because how well they've done these last Seventy years\nTheir fifth overall income global competitiveness is good for Japan but they according to this study have weak institutions and weak corporate governance does that show up in competition with American firms\nIt very much does the Japanese economy is that there's great innovation there's great research but the Japanese a historically in business have been very um\nA cautious towards restructure towards layoffs some of the what you'd call creative destruction that happens in the U.S of a company may grow a company may fail people fall out of that company and start new companies in Japan that's not quite that way you have much more of a government a\nDesire to minimize unemployment to in many cases supporter prop up businesses that may not be economically viable simply to keep a quarter and to keep employment at high levels but that kind of brain some of their competitors competitiveness quite frankly\nA surprise to me Australia I talk often with Australia I follow the governance is part of the Anglo file world it's very good about growing it has a vibe vibrant population and its fourteenth overall and it has something to grow but that's the envy of that most of the planet by\nThese sites labor rigidity and we can't invasion is that your experience and can you explain\nIt will I Would say is ... Australia still principally export economy with a a\nPrincipal client of Australia being China\nSo if the Chinese economy a catches a cold Australia catches the flu or they're they're very much dependent on that export economy you also have very high minimum wage a a lack of kind of the scale innovation of growth and that ability to challenge incumbency use while a very\nInteresting place in some very very smart people besides to a certain extent the high labor cost and the ... the the lack of major brands that you would see converting are investing can continue to hold the economy back to ...\nIs that are they self ... are the Australian self aware that their weekend innovation but they've got the education and the skills and the resources to be strong and\nWhat you see it in tech at least is that some of the best and brightest from Australia especially in the tech world just simply leave Australia to go to work for American or European or other tech companies there is not\nThe native base such tech in Australia that you see in many other countries so the best and brightest because they're portable because their workers and the knowledge economy simply\nSo there's a brain drain and it's caused by Australia's not responding to the competitiveness I'm a competitiveness a report now we moved to the big uh the the emerging markets which are all the excitement I was very much surprise to see Malaysia grouped in with China\nAh which had they both have thirty points to the frontier that means to a hundred the u._s. is doing very well we're not as a hundred either nobody is it a hundred according to this Malaysia before we go to China do you do you sense that Malaysia is growing very quickly and that is innovative\nMalaysia's growing very quickly you have a [noise]\nThe consumer are rising middle class there that is very success oriented but entrepreneurial a Malaysian historically had been traders and very open to commerce as a whole I think the big thing that we watch there simply\nBecause the government and whether the government stays in a liberal western democracy type style or swings towards the potential more fundamental\nI pick up on that on the charts saying that they have weak institutions that's the way they expressed that uh and there's not ability with the institutions weak institutions in Japan too that means I translate that Tammany Hall a lot of back scratching All right onto the mainland China\nChina's emerging technology along that the emerging technologies of Asia break down into three groups I mentioned the top group Malaysia and China Indonesia the Philippines Vietnam Thailand and Brunei or in the second group and at the bottom in Asia in east Asia's Mongolia Cambodia and Laos but we're going to tend to\nChina China's said in this report and it's very generous did just a it's an inflection point to move from an investment driven economy to a consumption economy is that happening\nChris because I hear routinely that China is not diversifying its economy not switching to the consumer\nWith the time that I spend their I'm always absolutely fascinated by the consumerism and the incredible modernization where the some of the best consumer some of the best capital is in the world are there in China\nI think that there's a very very rapid rise of the middle class in China in that embrace of consumerism that politics aside you have a motivated very intelligent\nPopulation that speaks to bring China to first world status and they understand how to from learning from the Koreans or the Japanese or others\nTo look at how to embrace technology how to embrace consumerism to really mold and economy in the model of the u._s.\nSo they're aware that they have to work on consumerism that that is the missing piece of their economy and are the institutions permitting them to get to that or to allow shopping you know that's what we do crafts we shop where shopping were great shoppers are they learning from\n... from from uh did you spend time in Shanghai and his team to great shopping capitals of the world whether it be rodeo drive or London high street uh Kensington or other the shopping and the shopping ethos in Shanghai rivals any place in the world and you see the\nThe consumers or you'll go into a factory\nWhere there are dozens of domestic phones produced in China and the factory workers who have lower incomes on the scale all one iPhones they want that consumer branded product they aspire to that product even know what might be much more expensive the domestic brands but they are classic great shoppers\nThis is a scholar report with the IAU Chris regal a scholar a leading marketing technology company travels the world and we will continue\nTo look at the

first collection for over Thirty years my goal is to help American men look and feel better when it comes to their own sense of style and now\nI've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of

redemption et cetera et cetera there is a kind of a in flexibility\nAnd a desire to destroy the consensus that you saw\nVery powerfully and the abolitionist movement up before the civil war now the south\nWas equally aggressive perhaps more aggressive in a reactive way but it's central a desperate objective was to preserve up their so called way of life\nAnd a essentially because of the a very\nPowerful wave of of shifting\n... within the U.S in the decades from the Eighteen twenty up to the civil war itself\nThe shifting tied made up the southern a plant or leap more and more desperate and us more and more aggressive but it has to be remembered that there is a difference even though they were both\nUm seeking to fight it out to have a contest there was a big difference between the plant or a aristocracy and their desperation to preserve slavery and the uh incredibly I'm\nA resolute and a unwavering a focus of the\nAbolitionist movement to actually literally destroyed a southern way of life and the uh second awakening in the u._s. which was a very powerful evangelical movement\nOf the Eighteen thirties and forties essentially was the force that collateral they gave the real um steam to the power of abolition is some\nAnd sort of sparked at and the migration of the great awakening itself from New England to New York and then to the border states and the Midwest was exactly the passage bet the abolitionist movement made before the war as it grew and grew and ...\nAnd what this means is that you have a social justice warriors today who call themselves progressive as\nThe truth spiritual uh inherit ... of essentially the the most radical early period a of of communism in Boston reformation and I'm\nDelbanco himself were first to the abolitionist as evangelical progressive and he he hammers home this idea that that age group are infused with the evangelical physicians are are most a can\nOr in their leadership\nTo the profit like I say uh\nAnd ... they're firing brim stone\nMen and women and the rest of the abolitionist movement as a whole was also millionaire and\nMeaning it sought to create a new promised land after the struggle and they struggled itself would be one of cleansing and purification and in the case of the civil war\nAlthough I don't think anyone intended it or even imagined that it could happen they cleansing purification of the civil war was the Clintons hand purification blood and so a abolitionist worse so committed to their course and then of course we\nCould not be um could not pursue the path of compromise it could never\nCome to any sort of agreement short of absolute trial and I find it fascinating that the entire union strategy in civil war ... was one of\nUnconditional surrender the initials of Ulysses Simpson grab US Grant it was called an additional surrender grad and this was a kind of token of the\nUm\nAbsolutist total aims of of the abolition movement abolitionist movement and its translation into the U.S war effort in the civil war and what this is translated into today\nIs a feeling that the only kind of force that can take us to the promised land that can wash

signs around the world\nLeading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience the business of America is small business this is the American business report\nWith gene marks who writes the small business column for the guardian as well as the Philadelphia Inquirer very good eating to gene there is good news in all directions for small business as the small businesses of America have been telling us for several years things are getting better all the time indeed\nWe have a three point five percent first round report\nOn the GDP for the United states consumers are spending an eye sees on that because that's what small business cares about you have reported that the fed beige book is indicating grows steady growth going forward\nAlthough there are trade concerns will mention that bought do small businesses continue optimistic or is there some hesitation is winter approaches in the north good evening to\nChina it's great to speak with you yeah all all that information or that you report it is accurate the uh uh GDP numbers\nCame out today is three and a half percent or as above what estimates were expecting um the economy um as continue to grow um some people are are forecasting more than a four percent uh yeah GDP increase in two thousand and Nineteen so we'll wait to see on that\nA jobs numbers good consumer spending is up consumer sentiment is leveling off a little bit but that could just be a monthly monthly blip now\nThe Federal Reserve um every month they go through and they they surveyed their um their their regional banks and um you know they put it together actually into like sort of a quarterly report that they like to do with their twelve regional banks called the the fed beige book\nAnd what it is it's again it's just a it's it's an anecdotal survey of how\nThings are going in the different regions of the country and um that base booked a results were were released today and uh we're reporting what we all know already economic growth is steady although most of the regional new Federal Reserve's reporting that businesses and all across all regions are\nStill are concerned about the tightening labor market higher wages um is a potential concern for for businesses as well as trade and how that's going to impact a you know a lot of states economies I mean John some states\nYou know California I'm a twenty two percent of their GDP comes\nFrom trade with overseas partners I mean Michigan it's like thirty eight percent it to some big numbers um so\nSome states themselves are are very you know are relying on on on trade Canada Mexico or are the biggest trading partners as well of course is China so right now we're at a stage and trade where you know you know North American trade seems to be on a good track\nI there's been some you know agreement there still has to be signed by the president and um as well as the Mexican and Canadian a prime ministers in presidents of China's the biggest you know so uh you know a lot of the Federal Reserve regions are concerned\nOr either I I Will resorts all 'cause you know I watch China very carefully there will not be a quick resolution to that because Beijing is not prepared to change its business plan\n... where it has become the number two economy on the planet by pretending to be a developing nation and therefore it can subsidize it can steal it can cut\nCorners you can ignore international agreements that's not going to resolve itself quickly\nUntil the leadership in Beijing resolved to join everybody else and play by transparency and rules so I go to what's wrong here in the United states right now and you mentioned it there's a shortage of workers Jean and I ... that has to be a continuing concern for small business\n[noise] yeah it does I mean I I wrote about this in the Philadelphia Inquirer um you know just a a week or so ago how employers not only in the northeast region but across the country continue um to to have a hard time when when\nWhen the unemployment rate comes out and shows historically low rate lowest rate since the late Nineteen sixties\nUm you know the Trump Administration shears the economist year ah but I Know my clients and small business owners around the country are not cheering when they see that because it is it makes them it makes it very very hard to attract new employees to their companies\nThey are fighting very hard against larger companies um they're dealing with a companies like Amazon as well as Wal Mart target that are paying higher minimum wage is going what what a lot of small businesses\nCan't afford it is you know it's it's a good the good the bad we're seeing a your growth ... it's great that unemployment is low but a lot of small business owners um are are finding it very very difficult to find\nPeople I can tell you that you know some of the things that I'm hearing across the country as I speak to groups I meet a lot of business owners many of them are reaching out to\nHigh schools technical schools community colleges\nNurturing relationships for students I'm really at a at a high school age inviting them to their companies offering internships speaking at the schools themselves\nThat has become a significantly more popular way for small companies to trying to attract workers um into their businesses um and they've been forced to do this and be innovative with programs like this and some of them are really succeeding\nGene you know a deal about personal income taxes and business tax so therefore how do we all get to be Jared Kushner is there a secret formula that you can lead on well ... ...\n... ... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and you know it was kind of referring you know inferring that oh you know what kind of sketchy deals are you doing where he's cheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case\nI mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Christmas politics or not\nUm he did not pay taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and attacks on set up that have been around for a while\nThat I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well ... and the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings rehabbed them renovate them and rent them out there are some specific depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can take some upfront deductions on that that offset any income that

I'd write a voyage which was a threat in my use but I then I learned that we're all going to go to jail together so I relax [laughter] well\nI did a good luck to soundtrack your brand and good luck to the music industry trying to find all those millions of small businesses are collecting royalties I don't think that's going to happen any\nTime that you've alerted them to the possibility that these that these that the music police could be showing up at any night knocking on the door saying all along right\nA entrepreneur as we celebrate them in ... in our world in ... in America today you have the king of Prussia a new guys we have the Silicon Valley new guys there in Austin, Texas how is it that they make bad decisions given that they looked so\nWell to do well there was a new study that came out as well that I wrote about on ... dot com and it's got a great Dane John it's taught curb your enthusiasm is the name of this study was done by researchers from the university a bath and Cardiff in\nLondon School of economics and you know what you know what I found\nIt found that optimistic entrepreneur is earn less money\nThey surveyed a bunch of entrepreneur is in the u._k. and other parts of the world and they found out that entrepreneur is that have a more optimistic outlook of the world are turned out that they made worse business decisions\nThan entrepreneur is a business owners\nThat were more pessimistic hat so it turns out that if you're a glass half full person sometimes you can be blind date by what the right decision or not as opposed to being somebody a little bit more\nHow shall I say cynical and John I'm a I'm a CPA cynicism comes as part of my job and so I I feel I have nothing to worry about there but if you're that kind of a person you might want to temper data better at least surround yourself with somebody a little bit more realistic\nFinally we have a minute and a report from Philadelphia this is in the Philadelphia Inquirer a very well informed about China and China and tariffs what do they want\nThey want to see the the Chinese published a punished excuse me in fact from a recent study by a company called on this by cell they study choose thousand entrepreneur is an overwhelmingly they supported President Trump's move against China\nSo you know the president has support of the small business community behind them and doesn't surprise me again I think I mentioned earlier businesses have been complaining about you know China's unfair trade practices and allegedly taking of technology\nAnd all that ... they're pirates their part it's it's not it's not a debate here there are pirates but I what I welcome is that small business owners in Philadelphia a city you and I love\nRight there on the front line of foreign policy thinking good [laughter] that they get it there one with Capitol Hill in fact they were probably ahead of Capitol Hill which took a while for the members of Congress to realize that those Chinese checks balanced\nGene marks he is a small business columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer and for the guardian the\nBusiness of America is small business this segment sponsored by gala

eighty two Fifteen hundred attached to a one eighty two Fifteen hundred for n J hormones dot com\nThis was the original plan I thought they had modified it because of protest within science community but apparently they did not um so after forty five days of active monitoring and signaling to try to make contact\nAnd this'll end in about a week or so they are going to then just a passive monitoring um than all other actively paying the ... the\nRover and the reason I thought they were going to extend that is because a lot of scientists says look with the the ... solar panels will probably covered by with dust by the solar storm that the global or a dust storm and therefore will need a dust devils to come by and clean it off\nAnd the dust settles seasons doesn't start until November\nBut it doesn't appear that's the case that I Would not be surprised if they do try to do a active signal to the rover a few more times beginning in January and that will be after this very very busy fall season when there's lots of planetary probes\nNeeding access to deep space network communications have that's one of the reasons they're stopping now I mean you've got hired but you've got a a inside landing on Mars you've got a you've got coming up uh the slide by a New Horizons are the kind of a belt object\nTo Dawn Dawn a series darn serious Juno Jupiter yes yes Juno\nJupiter you've got [noise] various laws auditors and so so this\nIs and you know now they have a pro heading towards mercury mercury and you also have to sell the puck approach so it's a very busy season and so that's one of the reasons they want her to hold off I suspect they will try again come January\nJust have to keep our fingers crossed that somehow that solar panels get revealed one of the concerns is that uh the cold temperatures\nWill ruin the battery for good and because there's no dust in the atmosphere think about it's always warm on cloudy night when the sky is clear nothing to hold the heat it and the Dusten was holding a hearing till it's gotten colder and so it could very well be that opportunity is finally left us\nWe're coming for a opportunity okay just sit right there will get their soon sounds so simple walk right up and say that is the Smithsonian on Mars All right we go to ... to a this is the third rehearsal why ... why do they were\nWell here's the deal they originally going to land in late October and grab a sample um but they were right you\nGrew does has no tiny dust pods no soft mood sections nothing at all it's all a rubble pile of of boulders rocks and that's a problem they hope to have a landing area that was\nEnough that was at least sixteen meters across that's about what is that is about two hundred feet um but they didn't find anything that why what they found something the best they've been able to find something twenty meters across about fifty the forty feet\nSo they decided to do additional rehearsals on hold off until January the landing\nAnd so they've done now they've done one of our solar earlier on and they this month they've done now to over our souls I have links to the pictures I posted the closest image and they don't have any scale so it's very hard to know that we do know\nThey were going to try to get within twenty meters of the surface about sixty feet so that's probably what this is so these are very tiny rocks um how good that their aim was I don't know they haven't lived released a press release\nThey now have an a couple of months to relax because I'm the son is\nMoving in between a ... and the earth and so therefore communications is not easy they won't lose communications but because of that they they got to hold off on these more complicated knew this would just have to wait and see what will happen in January what is Parker\n[noise] the pocket solar pro if you remember was launched a few a month or two ago um to do a series of increasingly close ... of the sun to tell us something about the atmosphere of the sun and the corona and did a flyby of ah Venus in October\nEarly October and what was the key here is that this week it turns itself around and talk looked back and took a picture of the earth and the mold had posted on behind the black it's not a particularly spectacular\nImages an unusual picture of the earth\nBob I'd have to say I wouldn't immediately recognized starts oh\nNo you wouldn't have made it basically well looking as low resolution\nClose up of of the earth the moon picking behind so it's just a bunch of pixels that's slightly a long because of the moon's presence what's important about this image isn't the image itself but one day could point that\nThe instrument precisely to look at the earth and it demonstrated to that the instruments wide field camera is working properly and that's really what it was done for instrumental\nOr operational test to make sure everything's good and that's what's good about this and so what are the wedding towards the sun and it's not going to burn up\nAnd Bob the Parker probe is a new information we're gathering up are backing up we have a couple of sun probes up there now so different different this is a\nBig star remember it might be an ordinary style but it is a big\nAnd so we there's a lot of things we just do not know and we've never been this close when it would no previous probe ever went this close to the sun so we're going to be diving into areas we've never seen\nYou know at the same time it's going to be looking at other data to confirm other theories you know it's always a saying that something she confirmed something should learning new the big thing is it's getting close to ... that's what's important\nSaturn has a moon named deal and sudden and not a rock star suddenly they're stripes on the on I didn't know to look Bob but I clearly from this report you're pointing to these are mysterious drives why\nYes I'm a what they what scientists have done is they look back at the archival that are of Cassini which is unfortunately no longer around Saturn\nAnd ... and the image to talk of the ... and they what they tend to five was 'em long narrow strike scattered across the surface that generally tend to a hundred kilometers in Lancaster so that's approximately thirty to three hundred miles long\nThey tend to be very narrow two to three miles and the brightest ... surrounding terrains that parallel to each other and they ... features and straight are not affected by top hog if we think of a road that goes straight along the county line goes up and down and around because it doesn't turn that just\nDoesn't make noises positive people the same thing with these the suggestion that also parallel to the equator\nThe suggestion is that there's some kind of\nThey were laid down from um external dust on materials that came in from off the planet that this is not unusual and violet of shatter um you've got the Saturn's rings and a lot of material being transferred between point dazed point base\nAnd so that's Paulie they think what's going on here but they do not know\nUm they could say there's a great quote from them the quote the material could have implications for the biological potential of the sub surface ocean\nTo be honest I'm not sure how they connect but that's what they said and\nThey wait wait wait do that again biological interpretation\nI yeah I don't know why they say this but you know they're always trying to sell their projects and anytime they can talk about life\nOn a I'm Sorry that I was thinking that this was crop riding in some fashion you know the way the way the aliens take an oath wheat fields and signal to it yeah\nI don't think that's the case it's more likely if you were right remember on behind the black if you do a search on behind the black you'll come up with a great images Saturn cell upset as any moons near the or inside the rings and they tend to have these gigantic ridges at the equator because they\nThey gather dust from the rings at the equator\nI'm sill muscles flex spaceships you know ... and saucers well here could be these a parallel to the equator and they'll lined up with a ... or it could be that this is just dusting picked up from out part for I don't know how it as any implications biological but nonetheless they make that point and so let's give them more money\nOur friend Alan Stern has another great idea this is the man who are devoted ... more than half of his life to New Horizons which is now in the ... rebelled after the fly by Pluto what's the latest about\nWhat they did it to him in a few other scientists and engineers did some research to see how could they go back to Pluto and the most effective manner that they they had been in the there's a debate you know we want to go to Pluto again at all but at the planet the the whole plan and we've only seen half\nBut they also want to get up to a pro out to the type of ... to do research there and what they did is they said if they use to a a an eye on type propulsion system that white was used on dawn which allowed us to visit all the asteroid they could launch a probe to Pluto and then using share on as a flyby technique\nOr leave the orbit at some point and then use the the iron\nPropulsion to travel throughout the type of belt so they get to bangs for one book and this is their proposed they said this makes sense and this allows them to get everything in one mission and so this is probably going to be opposed to NASA or others and they're going to try to make this mission happened

recession right now\nWith former leading presidents either in jail or in disgrace marry a very good evening to you both so narrow I can understand both in Iraq and understand if he's none of the above what does he present so what is going to provide Brazil but it needs good evening to\nWelded evening John um I think the first thing we can say about books that are oh is that he's not a member of the Workers Party um he's not a left wing socialist and I think I'm a lot of his popularity is explained by the fact that\nUm you know he was um he's he's the alternative to the socialist model on and you know why other why other I'm a Kennedy did not catch on because there were many other candidates and the first round\nIs a good question but I think um they were to ordinary to run to the mail to a mainstream\nSimilar maybe to what got the attention of voters in the United states during that the Trump um the two thousand sixteen campaign both in our very outspoken he's not shy about saying things that are politically incorrect or sometimes he makes very rude comments\nOn but I think that people feel like there's something real about him um and they are just so disgusted and reviled by the socialist Workers Party because not only the collapse of the economy\nOn their watch but also that gross corruption I mean it was unbelievable the way that they just\nA ... abuse their power to enrich themselves the business elite and um and the party and you know all the while that people are learning about this there also\nAre hurting economically they had nearly three years of recession then they had\nA very slow growth in this year and next year is not forecast to do much better so they're looking for other ideas and both ... while he's not a market liberal he's basically\nI Would say the an antidote to um to socialism and we can talk about that a little bit more because I think that it's not entirely\nClear what his what his solutions are going to be but I think that people just started saying anybody but the socialists and that's how we got where he is\nYou've taught me over the years that Brazil's a hybrid mixture of socialism at one scale kinda redistribution and back scratching and also a day just economic forces enterprises that are vast\nAnd take a and grab capital and don't permit entrepreneurship or experimentation is both an arrow both in our own going to answer that these big like Petro bras and ... and then the peasants who are who are who are bought off with a broad\n[noise] well that's the sixty four million dollar question and of course you know he hasn't won yet or people I talked to give him between a\nSeventy and eighty percent chance that per gallon on Sunday [noise] but um uh even if he does win all it's not clear his he's been in Congress for twenty seven years his voting record is bad for the state\nYou know I mean this is as we talk about right and left and I think sometimes the language gets very confused but you know he's not a free market guy\nA according to his is history a that being said he has a University of Chicago PHD economists who is who is chief um adviser and consulted\nOn and he is also need certain commitments for example he says that the central back must be independent and of course the central bank losses independence during the ...\nAnd that was a big reason why they got into so much trouble and they got back to double digit inflation and so forth so he's made some commitments that I think are very encouraging he's also said that he will privatize and you have to remember\nThat under Lula um and ... the state was getting back into all kinds of economic activity so both in all his says he will reverse those decisions he'll get rid of those stayed on enterprises that I think there might be somewhere around fifty of those um but\nHe also has stopped short of saying for example that he's going to privatize cut your boss he says he wants to keep in state has what he called strategic companies and that's of course a disappointment to those of us who believe in the market\nUm but I think a lot of people are just hoping that uh that um you know in terms of orders of magnitude he'll get closer to market economics then obviously the the P. T. is even if he doesn't you know do the full Monty\nSecurity uh I Do I have never traveled to Brazil but I read anecdotes to say that the streets of the large cities can be dangerous because of abduction dangerous for the well to do does ball so narrow speak to that is is what he says credible\nWell first of all I Would say that most of the danger when we talk about danger I think like with respect to homicides most of that occurs in poor neighborhoods and the\nThe major victims of the high a homicide rates are um the poor I mean they're the ones who are killed in these bad neighborhoods and that is why I'm despite the fact that he's been accused of being a racist and so forth\nSuggesting that the\nGovernance in Guatemala is\nVulnerable to interfere in from outside and I at this point I'd have to say\nA ... vote a vulnerable to the disruption of a money making operations is silver mines and Guatemala either kept defend itself or is in the hands of people who don't want us to defend itself how to say\nWell I I think that it's you know what we have to bear in mind when we see this caravan and I I Am a believer that it is politically organized an onslaught\nOf designed to wreak havoc to create disorder to become a project to create a problem for Donald Trump the head of the elections I'm totally believe in all of those things\nThat being said you have an enormous amount of number of of young as you say young males but young people in Central America\nWho don't have jobs um who who just have you know almost absolute despair in terms of their future\nOf course they want to go to the United states but not by the way the way some native is field because they want to come here and um you know live off the off the welfare state they want jobs and they see the United states is a place where they would have opportunity so you know if you start organizing and you\nTell people okay we're going to use\nStrength and numbers to get into the United states you're going to get a lot of people to join you I'm having said that I think it's really important to understand what is it in the economy for these countries that is making\nA these young people so desperate and that's why I wrote that column about the silver mining Guatemala because that's silver mine was employing well over a thousand people\nAnd all of a sudden you've got these um you know NGOs coming along and say well you know the challenging the a right of the silver mind to operate because supposedly um they didn't up properly\nConsult with a indigenous groups in the area before they began operating silver mine and you know you dig down you find out first of all that that the census\nOf the most recent census when the wind was started found that there were two\nTwo [laughter] that's\nToo she W O indigenous people in the whole area where the silver mine was operate\nThis is the ... the ... so you're saying ... the I guess it's a shame to and\nYou know I'm not I'm not a you know doubting that the shouldn't have right but um you know the inside the the property there was not this\nImpact on the ... community that there is that the mine is charged with being sort of you know sensitive to and once they proved that the court um said well okay that may be true and we acknowledge it there were only two there but um\nWe think that ah the government should go back and interview and look into it more and you know they've been dragging their heels on this the mine has been closed for well over a year and a snow into a year and a half I think\nAnd all these people who were working for the money and\nBy the way the mine was not accused of any environmental degradation it wasn't excuse of any labor violations it had spent millions of dollars in the area on education and community um enhancements\nFor the people who lived in the area and now all of a sudden the mines shut down all these people don't have a job and um and and by the way the mind also\nThe court had the option of saying that the mind could continue to operate\nA while the government went and did these consultations with the indigenous population and the court had done that in other cases but in this case decided not\nTo um I think that there's a lot of questions about how those judges made their decisions\nUm but regardless of that the bottom line is that here you have the Guatemalan of ... or Guatemalan governmental institution um you know deliberately shutting down a source of employment and wealth creation\nFor a large number of people in a very poor part of the country\nAnd this was in an isolated event this happens over and over again in these countries\nAnd um I think it's one thing that we need to keep in mind when you see all these people and of course our hearts go out to them we say you know that they need jobs and and they're moving through Mexico now because they're desperate but you know what these countries do to make\nThe where they are where these people live um you know more um attractive for them to stay and there's plenty they can do but they have to have the political will to do it as I said this is not\nUm this this movement of people through through Central America and Mexico is not accidental these people are marching in lockstep they're organized\nI'm not to say that the migrants themselves are necessarily political but it's a political movement that is is basically um as I as we sat in our editorial earlier this week it's very similar to when she del Castro unleashed all of those migrants from the port of Marty Allan Nineteen eighty\nExtremely to save destabilizing 'em and difficult for the country that is asked to accept them and um so I think that the Trump Administration is right to be\nA challenging um uh the the organizers of these marches and to be telling these people that they this is not the way that we accept immigrant\nOr you mentioned Cuba so for the final minutes here you have a column about Cuba's conduct and you identify it as a\nAs a master of Venezuela what we're seeing the catastrophe event in Venezuela must be looked at as what Havana once is is what does this help too but I have the people of Havana are the people of Caracas without food and resources\nWell that doesn't care if the people of that as well I don't have food resources Atlanta wants to control Venezuela\nAnd um if that means that as well as the empty out and there's not going to be anyone there at the very small population of additives care about that because then I had done that to the island itself for sixty years\nSo this is a um a matter of geo political strategy on the part of Havana and yeah I mean I think that uh it's quite obvious that the Venezuelans would not be capable of the kind of in ... intelligence control\nOn control over passports or the electronic voting system the ID cards on its buys on people that has you know it has its chemical everywhere and that's a that's a very Cuban I'm a a strategy and tactics\nUm that ... has been using at home for for many many years\nSo I mean the reason I wrote that column is because people keep saying what can we do to help the Venezuelans you know because it's a they're they're they're quite um you know\nThey're they're suffering a lot right now and I think that it's just wrong to think that you can solve this problem and crap has this problem has to be solved the Nevada and this is the problem that was\nDead aged in a bed it's by Brock Obama\nWho basically supported um the dictate the military dictatorship of the doubt Castro gave it oxygen gave it food gave it support when it was breaking down and\nThat you that the lifeline ... keep going and to reach out at you expand\nIt was already working on this expansionist a project in bed as well but that very much helped on the Cuban a military dictatorship continue and I'm so somebody how ill and I'm assuming that Trump fitness stationary the U.S administration but at some point\nYou know that the democracy that we have to get together and and Taliban I Know my you know and that and and the result is that it is what you're saying that it's All right now\nMary Anastasia Grady no moss indeed she is the America's columnist and editor at the wall Street Journal editorial board I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nBallots\n[noise]\nReally\n\nCloudy I'm Bob Brown

fifty six year olds user say are facing numerous charges Geoffrey Berman as us attorney for the southern district of New York\nTo defendants conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema\nAgo the U.S Navy's dispatch though we're not at war with turkey and we're not really sharing the spoils of the division of the of the Ottoman Empire the French and the British are as the extremely prominent we sail into Constantinople and you paint a picture vividly uh this is Nineteen twenty Twenty one\nThat the remains of deliberately and the and the first war are everywhere with rex ships with possible minds floating around with evidence of pirate havens on the on the shoreline so this is not a restored Constantinople does the navy regard it is a good posting or is this a punishment posting what's the opponent of the sailors\nBy and large independence I'm not um [noise]\nUh they're not always the same but it was of course a a a very romantic very I'm very I'm a fabled

um and before that the um\nThe um ... should with the ... straight and are gone into um Greece and so ah all of that and then as a things um came around all all that of course more and more of what the um\nThe uh the uh city was like a began to a a coming back stories speaking coming coming back to the stage and so it was a very very attractive thing for many savers\nOr we need to meet the commander of the American flotilla the American I'm a ships and his name is admiral Bristol and you describe him he's fifty years old his wife is Hal and\nYou describe him as as a combination of Amy a bowl and stubborn I Wish he regarded as a good commander by the and the men in the in the destroyers and the cruisers\nOh I think they were they were pretty much I'm a thought he was a very strong commander and this or they they were on his side by and large course but he knew nothing of the circumstances they were going into and eat\nMore and more um dominated their points of view he was an old a football player from Annapolis and so he was awfully a awfully could be awfully genial but he could show assuming aggressive scowl or what he wanted to and all of 'em did\nYes you you you have a wonderful photograph in your book of the admiral scaling I I guess he wasn't friendly to cameras and he was a power that is not on and we don't have anything comparable today Bob is I read it he was more powerful than the ambassador\nAnd his word was law for not only the navy but reporting back to Washington\nIt was that the nature of the navy in those days if you were an admiral on scene you were God\nWell he was he in fact the de facto embarrassed or the other\nUh fellows are there were much just a sport it to him and posed this we'll up on them and they would have to America have not had unabashed or since the war\nA although they didn't declare war on turkey but he was a on scene and so uh and he talked to everybody there and he um learned everything and so he was able\nTo um do Washington or his point of view and his point of view on more or less dominated in Washington is what was going on there he was very knowledgeable I and he uh\nUh his destroyers one drop of Black Sea itchy and so on and so he was very knowledgeable and all all the way it came across\nRight they made regular calls and so they were there was no Internet there were no satellites that we're no airplanes by following in this area so a navy destroyer making calls in the black sea in the gym that was fresh information one\nOf the information to the admiral yes one in ... and then he\nCables

Patrick it's worth mentioning here\nThat as the Americans um we've talked about the Marines coming into the army as well the field artillery as Americans come into line in the summer of Nineteen Eighteen they see that the French Army is no longer fighting and will not fight\nIt is it leads to bill award was not fighting and then it sort of reconstitute itself it's with sons and is is is much more um a stable force\n'em but initially yeah that was fighting and it was a the American the presence of these American troops had an enormous morale boost as well as tactical a position that they provided by blocking this offensive\nI Want to be a little more severe the Americans the Australians and the Canadian or the offensive unit that crack the hindered and Bert lie in the summer and fall Nineteen Eighteen not it's the fresh Australian troops the fresh\nOut of the French Canadian troops because the British are also exhausted and the Americans off ... not only are launched an offensive but they have a million men coming behind them\nYes I mean this is an extraordinary story that's told it in in the unknowns\nIt's the story of going from two hundred and twenty thousand regular troops are ... you know in Nineteen Seventeen to over for a million men and arms in Nineteen eighty two million of them in Europe yeah he was at a time ... story building this incredible army\nThere's a flood coming which is part of the political calculation the Germans must make here can they stopped the Americans so we go we've we've talked of the uh Marines that fellow would\nAnd the field artillery as well so we turn now to a man named Sanders company a second engineers born in medicine Bo was ... and he is striking and most importantly and striking because he's one of ten thousand Native American who participate in the first war yes\nI mean the story of Native Americans in the first war is sort of a forgotten story\nAs well and in fact many of these Native Americans weren't even American citizens at the time they um\nThey had been deprived of that by the constitution you will recall the one that was signed in the Eighteen century it had not been at this point corrected\nYes and but interestingly enough the stereotype of the American injury Indian as the ultimate warrior kind of holds up in the American army they're put in some of the most dangerous positions and the American army as runners or as reconnaissance Sanders this as an engineer and what is their job he's in he's a combat engineer\nBut he's not there to build things he's there to blow things up or to reach the line and this is the ... hope of the ... of World War one he's given wire cutters and told the individual strands of mountains of barbed wire to breach it to make a whole to allow the advancing troops or to break through\nHe's president at the big battle that is to calm the Meuse Argonne a before and during and after amuse are gone they send the combat engineers in first I Know this very well Patrick knows it very well because my father was a combat engineer and the second ...\nAnd we talk to them on the sixtieth anniversary his job on D Day was the gap assault team Thirteen\nTo breach the German obstacles on Omaha Beach that's exactly the job Sanders has he wasn't landing in a landing craft\nHe's to go in front of the salt battalions on his belly I can imagine and cut the wires so not only the infiltrate can come through but also the tanks\nAbsolutely his first real action is um my sights of mellow would any fights this was on but his first um significant action is at San ... where the Americans go on the offensive to reduce a salient that had been created there since the beginning of the war and Sanders is pushed out\nFront along with one other than as September yes and it pushed out front to breach the barbed wire and\nThe German commander on the other side has given orders to all of his men to shoot any if they ever site Indians on contact immediately and in focus all sniper fire on them so he's really a target if he's if he's able to be if they identify him but he's out there in front and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "New York", "day": "27"}
