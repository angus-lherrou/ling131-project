S. does very well okay fine go where there were very good at it but what do we learn what are we good at and why and there's plenty of room for improvement here so I go to the questions that the competitiveness a document a asks\nTowards the closed for all of us to debate these don't have answers these are observations and their anecdotal and therefore of them and we'll go through them as best we can is there a formula for innovation or can you plug in odd do institutions matter\nA is prosperity\nPossible alongside people and the planet or do we have to ruin the environment\nAnd turn people into Web sites and finally should countries pursue openness or do you is control of markets command economy the way forward there you can immediately think of anecdotes so I'll ask you Chris because you traveled so widely\nIs there a formula now having read the competitive as\nA survey is there one formula that works and there are some pillars here are indeed administrative security or is there any combination that you've found magic\nI think the biggest thing that we see and we do business in the tech world within twenty eight countries around the globe and have developers and twenty countries around the globe those environments that are free\nOpen an open means open to succeed or open to fail but to create an educated populace that free to innovate and risk take the more than a society can reward or enable benefit for risk takers the more people will\nTake those risks the more that there is freedom for innovation less central planning less government intervention the freer the better\nAnd technology is is one of those pursuit that you really want to be able to say I have an idea have the ability to chase that with smart people unless enough capital to pursue that and having the environment the best thing a government can do tend to ...\nThe conditions for success but governments can't mandate success when it comes to attack when it comes to that interaction between tech and consumers\nI'm struck by a little detail here that Korea South Korea and Japan are ... because of what the report identifies as a hesitant as a hesitation built on they don't like uncertainty\nAnd R and D is all about uncertainty and trying and failing the certainly that that describes our our our wizards the last hundred years I can you measure and can you think of another country to other countries that are prosperous and the top twenty who are hesitant about uncertainty Chris\nI think the greatest one that we would say is you see some of the hesitancy in Western Europe France as an example failure can be a real challenge their societal leap as well as from a government perspective not only the the\nDisregard or dislike for failure but the\nPunitive penalties for success in an environment like France if your\nGoing into ... and you have an entrepreneurial bent the first thing that you plot is how do you exit France because God Forbid you should be successful the government is not your partner the government is you're over lord of the taxation level and you have an incentive not to be successful in economy is like that where the taxes are truly

wave of retail transformation visits scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience that I go to the global and American business report it combined with John Candy ... most recent real clear markets where he edits\nBecause John is addressing a story that is now in much in debate by American protect American\nMake certain that good don't come into America from the outside and also\nPeople from other countries don't come into America from the outside immigration under control H. one B. visas more difficult to obtain John a very good evening to you you begin with the anecdote of the people who put together air conditioners once upon a time will is carrier nights you know to\nAnd you connect that to a Wall Street journal op ed that ran most recently by Richard Florida and he and a half away and these two don't exist together job there is there is a conflict here\nThe carrier conflict on one hand the great success and the wall Street Journal's recommendation that the U.S has to double down on innovation how do they not go together good evening to Joe\nHey John they don't go together because you think about wheels carrier he\nDeveloped the air conditioner carrier corps was based in Syracuse New York but it was as though it was based in Florida simply because the advent of the air conditioner\nLed to people moving down south in droves they could suddenly live and work in a place that was historically uncomfortable to live and work in\nAnd we all know what it's like to go without air conditioning to work to be in hot humid weather for extended periods it saps her energy and strength and she think about the air conditioner it quite literally made the world much more productive and so this is the genius of free trade when markets are open\nIt's as though innovations are taking place next store\nEven though they happened on the other side of the world I don't care where the air conditioner was created I just want access to it so it makes me better off\nThis runs counter to Florida and in ... Richard Florida has toys essay they say that if the U.S doesn't maintains technological edge are living standards will go down if the other world let the rest of the world lapses no no no no no no we have lower living standards precisely because\nPeople aren't as innovative and other parts of\nThe world that also suggest John as you said before it presumes that we won't go and get the best technology wherever it comes from or the best or the best equipment whoever comes from\nWe're not close minded about what we can buy their hands are long standing example of Home Depot which is as good as from everywhere and innovation from everywhere\nSo this idea that we're just going to buy buy at home and invested home and the educated home is this is this an expansion of the protectionism talk we've had for two years John his out what's going on\nIt is but what's interesting is I don't you know\n... and a half away comes from Brookings Richard Florida comes from academe the University of Toronto I don't think they realize\nJust how protectionist their argument is but in fact it's protectionist they argue that if other parts of the world they argue that the U.S faces an assault of innovation from other parts of the world they haven't ruined Devon wrecked Chinese standards of living they've improved it\nAnd so what's exciting to me is to think\nAs the rest of the world liberalize as as people around the world start um we're pursuing innovation too\nI think about all the will us carriers that exist in China that are no longer be having their talents suffocated such that think about the future of American living standards if the Chinese grow we are going to have living standards in the U.S that will that will stagger S. for how advanced they are\nAre you give a wonderful example of the man who is who was Steve Jobs his father Steve Jobs is no longer with us he came from Syria Steve grow up without knowledge of him but in any event he came from Syria what if he stayed in Syria what would we be today John\n[noise] well if he had stayed in Syria Steve Jobs bother stays there there's never an apple it's no mistake that Steve Jobs was able to create apple in the United states the United states doesn't have a technological edge what it has a freedom edge\nTalented ambitious people keep coming to the United states because free people can prosper\nIt's people who drive progress not countries if the if the U.S had a technological edge than east Paolo Alto it'd be as prosperous Paolo Alto no which the individuals in Palo Alto the prosper a prosperous and run route twenty eight in Austin, Texas\nAnd so what matters here is that we remained open to the world's drivers because if they get to the United states they have the chance to innovate\nLooked at from the rest of the world\nOur living standards are lower precisely because countries around the world have been suffocating talent forever let's hope the opposite happens what Richard Florida and the un halfway want we want China to thrive we want India's thrive we want France to thrive we want them to create their own Microsoft is if they do\nThink about how will live here it's the equivalent of what our businesses have done for the world for decades\nOf detail John I've had conversations with my colleagues the last day about\nBoosters about investing in pro commercial companies that sell or make available boosters for lifting small satellites into orbit commercials small satellites not that great big communications million dollar outfits but\nA dedicated for mining purposes or population purposes or or what the weather and those companies are are growing here like mushrooms\nThat the striking thing is the Europeans have noticed and our puzzle how they can catch up\nThe Europeans have only encouraged investment in space launch system's ... boosters with European space agency big space like our NASA they have not made it available because their markets are ... heavily regulated they have not made it available to build companies that can build rockets and\nSell their I sell access to them do other commercial enterprises Europeans notice the difference I I use this as an example of how our innovation leads the world they're going to try to catch up to us good for them but our innovation is an envy for even our best allies\nIt without question and think about what it means okay so that the U.S will be in the lead in space but if markets are open and free advances that take place in the U.S will lift up\nInnovation around the world the foreigners will be able to buy what we produced a no one creates things so that they can sell it to small market any any innovator wants to sell it to the world and so if the if Americans achieving in at harnessing something really from space\nThe rest of the world will benefit and just the same\nIf towel to people from around the world achieve inside she er driverless cars we in the United states will benefit as though it happen next door to us the important thing is that people are free and the trading laser free after that\nThe where of innovation doesn't matter what's what only matters is that the innovation happens\nJohn Candy his most recent book is\nThe end of work he's also the author of who needs the fed riding a regular markets on John bachelor this has been the global in American

aristocracy a that was entrenched and a\n... incapable of connecting with people of France the otherworldly which was equally wealthy as it turned out and quite more powerfully dynamic was what we now call the Bush was eat and they were the ones who actually constructed lead\nAnd rammed through the French Revolution and eventually pay became\nThe successor relate to the old aristocrats of the also regime no I'm not saying those lines are quite as clearly etched today because there are plenty of old\nRepublican or money bags robber barons oligarchs big corporate types but the fact of the matter is that the Republican uh elite today\nHas shifted from what it was when it nominated Romney for president for example or or when it was a invested\nIn the Bush family for two presidency's and it has moved much more into the terrain\nOf 'em and it's an imperfect word of of populism non elitist based party even though it has an elite that elite Israeli more closely connected\nWith the people that the Democrats and this is a problem\nThat the Democrats have yet to come to terms\nI Want to use the the visual of the president's rally in\nMissoula, Montana within these last hours a gorgeous pictures and to us by the White House on the president on stage in his blue suit in his red time surrounded by the colorfully dressed an extremely vividly hardworking people of Montana\nIn various uh ...\nActs of cowboy garb farmer garb by a hardworking rodeo guard and uh with lots of American flags and lots of celebration of Trump and you you were just truck immediately by this is America you know the purple waves of grain in the background and the beautiful mountains of\nMontana but in in in there looking at a man who's a billionaire who's from New York City\nAnd I'm aware of the fact that the president is not is a representative of the populist movement he's not the populist movement itself he's a spokesperson for it but I'm thinking how long Jill we understand that they don't need to\nUm\nObey the east coast how long Michael I I've puzzled to myself the picture was there and now the Democrats can't manage that picture today that doesn't work for them if they tried to rally like this they would get the progressive which is a very unusual dressing style and it's not like cowboys in Montana\nBut the cowboys of ... you know the cowboys in Montana are so vivid there still Americana Michael you want to know well what do you need Trump for you you can do this yourself that's the puzzle that came to me when I looked at the picture\nWhat Trump is a populist not ... ... ... in in any condition related to his wealth or not to be defined in any way by as well but rather his relationship\nWith um the common man and all those years he did The Apprentice but more importantly all those years but he appeared on W. W. F.\nWrestling right right right and participated in them he created a kind of demonic a figure\nThat was a representation of the people he now leads and Democrats can't really understand\nThat that this is actually the past you know FDR was as aristocratic as a anyone could get in the United states and in Nineteen thirty two and he didn't have to have like Trump but\nHe certainly was able through Warm Springs and his ability to literally embrace\nWounded Americans he was able to create this bond as well and this goes back to Andrew Jackson and all of the president's who've embraced a demonic moment in American Life when it's important\nFor elites to be\nUp close to the people and how that is done a ... has varied and yet it has to be done and all I can think of when I look at the Democrat or the blue elite\nIs the scene I saw in the ... or\nA or an election eve and all of the people in the Javits Center\nAnd they were all your piece yeah these were people literally living in a bubble because you know the Javits Center is a graced by a great glass ceiling\nAnd there was this darkest contrast in terms of not simply atmospherics but the entire or a ... of of what it means\nA in terms of of elite identity and and elites need to find a way in times like these to truly a connect with the people\nThat I Want I Want to give me an eight them don't see that happening at for Democrats and this is a tremendous problem for\nThem I have an example I have an example for the blue ... when we come back from a commercial that's running in New Jersey right now for the midterm election\nPromising to restore the status quo Michael ... of Johns Hopkins his new article in American conservative is about the civil war is it you can't be sure the title is made for civil war we build America on the politics of national division I'm John ... this is the John ...

catastrophe September fifteenth twenty Eighteen a shark attack off Cape Cod the second\nUh I have a profound worry but not Marshall\nA young man attacked off the California coast a south of Long Beach and I go now to someone who can help me understand these two attacks on two cos and why there might be a changing pattern in great white shark attacks on people\nThis is Chris Lowe ducks Chris Lowe he's director of the shark lab at California State University at Long Beach Chris a very good evening to you and thank you for this these two attacks ICU commenting in both cases one in California and one in\nA Cape Cod so let's start with the mortal attack in Cape Cod nine Fifteen Eighteen they closed the beach accordingly but why was a great white shark so close to the coastline and why was this particular man attacked because if I understand correctly comments he made\nGreat white sharks don't mean to attack people good evening to\nGetting and um yes this is this is a question that that's been kind of burdening scientist for a long time why the sharks occasionally bite people\nAnd in order to have that happen we have to have two things we have to have people in sharks in the water at the same time in the same place and figuring out what motivates those Israeli challenge\nThe challenge it tells me that we need to discover some of the facts about these attacks the first attack Arthur met a chi or from the Boston area he was attacked while swimming and the shark attacked him so brutally\nThat when he was pulled out of the water has classical was exposed but the shock didn't stay around\nA there was a trail of blood according to the eye witness who pulled him out of the water and the sharks swam away so is it that the shark bit the wrong thing did the shock feel attacked do we know anything about what a shock why a shark attack some people and bypass as others\nWell I think we first have to get out why shirts might be at beaches that that people use and in this particular case what's happened is the recovery of the gray seal population\nAnd and it's been pretty much all marine mammals have shown pretty dramatic recovery since there are protections seventies\nOr so it's really been recovery of the gray seal population and the gray seals using those beaches as important liquor you habitat\nA that was really the draw to bring in large adult white shirts to those areas to begin with\nOr I assume you know so it's it's it's the seals in Cape Cod which are gorgeous but they're yeah they're the bait and uh that brings them in\nExactly so we know based on tagging studies that white church Rome entire stretches of ocean they cover thousands of miles a year\nBut their prey like like seals do use land periodically and what it does is it concentrates that pray in one general area and whether that be off Cape Cod or off you know California off shore islands\nThose are the draws that that bring the shirts back from sometimes thousands of miles of ocean migrations\nTo these areas where all their foods concentrated so think of it like\nYou know being out on a on a hike or a cross country travel travel and and you come across at Costco and that's where all the food is concentrated in bulk and it's easy to buy everything you need well for white sharks\nThat's kind of what these robberies or acting like they're drawing them to these locations and they're great places for them to feed for periods of time\nTo the attack in and need is a pop a beach town near San Diego and on San Diego county this was September twenty nine twenty Eighteen Thirteen year old king have now at the hospital\nWas attacked by great white shark you've done very careful work because the shock didn't stay around to identify what ... uh who what attack keen\nAnd you've used DNA how does it work Chris\nWell you know all living animals have DNA and their cells and when those cells slough off their body into the environment they become part of the environment and believe it or not in the ocean there's literally a a stew of animals DNA out there\nSo you can take a sample of water [noise] um and you can actually find thousands of animals little pieces of their DNA that are specific to their species\nSo we had I collaborate with a number of researchers have developed a technique where we can go out and take water samples and then filter that water down in probe\nThat's due of DNA from all these animals to determine whether or something like a white shirt has been present\nBased on his left off DNA we refer to that as environmental DNA\nSo using it very similar approach what I was able to do is swab canes wetsuit where he had been bitten and swab the troops marched with a team that Senate traded to the wet suit\nAnd then my geneticist colleague was able to go through and amplifying demonstrate that there was clearly white shirt DNA in each one of those gashes in his ...\nDo you call it eat DNA and this strikes me it it's like CSI white shark here ah you\nCut is it kind of is\nYou can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because well they they use this area of common place I learn from you\nWell that's the part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and how recently that shirts been there so in that case it's sampling water when we're measuring what we call them by our mental DNA that's worth it\nIn the DNA comes from um we don't know how long that DNA will last before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer is to try to measure how long the white tricks DNA can remain in a particular before it's completely gone\nBut in the case of the wet suit that was different because the shirts DNA had become trapped in the ...\nShow in many ways that as a standard forensic techniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now I'm Rene biologist or kind of late to the party so we're just now starting to adapt some of these techniques for use in kind of figuring out who might have been involved in a shark bite\nThe baby's start showing up off our beaches\nAround and made through at about October and and the question that we're trying to figure out is what makes Southern California beaches good nursery habitat for white sharks well a lot of shark species huge nurseries and the reason why they give birth in those areas is because it offers protection for their young\nIt offers an abundance of food and good conditions so that those young can grow very quickly so that they can overcome many of the things that could potentially kill them in their first year so\nI think Southern California is a little bit different than what we see off Cape Cod and the reason for that is the adults are showing up at those beaches primarily to feed on seals but in Southern California we really don't see a lot of seals on our beaches there around me off shore islands and that's typically where we see adult white shirts\nThe birth it's a live birth and there are about five feet long that's a big baby but there is no nursing so this isn't a matter of a mother bear protecting her cubs\nBut I learned from you that sharks are warm blooded like human beings and the young sharks sharks are not ready for the deep water is that why they hang around\nWell that's part of it so what church or or what we call ... ... and basically as long as they keep swimming they can keep their body warmer than the water now the babies are fairly small and they have all the same equipment to do that\nLike the adults the problem is their bodies are so small that we don't think they're very good at keeping the heat\nThat they generate and therefore they act more like a call buddy shark\nShow during the summer one of the reasons why we think there is so close to shore and such shallow water because the water's warmer there than it is further offshore\nThe other reason is believe it or not females give birth to their young and they're completely on their own so they have to figure out everything on their own and they don't know what is a threat\nSo one of the reasons why we think they're in such shallow water is because that's a safe place for them there are fewer large predators and then the third reason is they have to figure out how to eat on the road\nAnd the most common thing we find in baby white shirt stomachs or sting rays which in Southern California\nCarpet RC floor so this makes it easy abundant food source for them for a naive young shark like a baby watcher\nI also learned that they migrate from your area long the San Diego county to the south or at least they have here to for and you raise the issue of whether they're ... they're changing their pattern because of El Nino or El Nino or law Nino or is it climate change can we tell ...\nWell we're we're still learning about that but so far we've learned that the young white sharks are temperature sensitive they don't like water too cold and when our water temperatures dipped below sixty degrees that seems to be a cue\nFor them to migrate south to warmer waters of Baja during the winter um the following springs a little sharks return to Southern California\nBut what we noticed was during the strong El Nino that we had in two thousand Fifteen our winner water temperatures never gets below sixty five degrees and none of the shirt so we had that year left\nThey state so would that told us was that El Nino can completely changed their migratory patterns and the other thing that we're learning is that as our oceans are warming we're starting to detect not just baby why church further north\nBut I Do white sharks are now being more commonly detected off Oregon Washington and even British Columbia\nAs the war as the water warm so great white sharks like warmer water or they can range into the deep cold correct\nThat's correct and but they can't spend a lot of time if those steps so typically they like water temperatures kind of um about sixty degrees up to maybe about Seventy degrees so for adults they're a little bit more temperature tolerant they can tolerate greater extremes in temperature\nBut the young ones have a very ... fairly narrow temperature leaves that they like\nSo but what we're seeing is as our global oceans warm\nThose warmer temperatures are starting to occur at higher latitudes than we're kind of nice too so what we've been telling people is look you may live in a place where you've never had to experience white sharks before but the ocean is changing and you should keep an eye out because\nAs the ocean warms we might expect white church to march further north\nI understand there's an experiment underway in your area San Diego county something called a clever boy this might turn into a mass production it's to warn of sharks to warn to stay away from sharks how does the clever but we were\nSo clever bully uses sonar so ah basically it's using the board fishing sonar ships you download fishing Soner but this sooner points out in by using in a series of these forwards facing sooner bullies you can basically create a video image using sound\nTo track objects that move through that\nSo in our field so the idea there is you can have these ... and you can have a shark moved through that accrue stick or sonar field and you can identify that target\nAnd say that target you know is the target of a dolphin or that's a shark or you know that's an eight foot jerk no that's a ten foot shark so the technology has great promise it just doesn't cover a very large area and it's very expensive it requires a lot of power to to power the sonar\nSo um it it could provide some really interesting data now the question is the California coast is huge\nSo the question is can we even cover enough for the California coast to make a you know technology like that effective as a just simply a warning system to let us know when large sharks maybe within coastal waters\nYou put the first one ah south of the bell bow appear you know these things I Do not in Newport Beach and ... gained a lot of attention has been effective so far is it warned anybody away from a great white shark\nNot to my knowledge and again it's that's not my work that's a there's a company that right you know markets this product um you know we're very interested in their results but so far we haven't heard of any um so it will be very interesting to see what that technology turns out\nAnd even though they're covering him very small area it will be interesting to see how effective it is in in a dentist thing the difference between sharp white shirts and leopard shared some of our non threatening species and then of course dolphins and ... and some of the other wildlife that girl on the beaches\nYou tag great white sharks or when fisherman bring them to and you follow them uh and that data you're accumulating now have you learned anything new from that that at in this changing pattern because of warming we have about a minute Chris\nSo over the last ten years we've managed to tag about a hundred and ten juvenile white sharks and actually we've learned quite a bit about their migration patterns we've learned about what what cues may drive those migrations and right now we're learning about how the young ones find it a nursery beach and how much time they spend in that habitat\nBut we still don't know what makes a good nursery habitat nursery\nSo we need to develop new tools and that's something we're working on now we're developing a ton of is underwater tracking robots and and water simpler so we can measure for white shirt DNA were using drones so we're using a variety of technology to try to answer those questions\nSo we can predict from year to year where my T shirt show up\nChris Lowe Dr Chris Lowe is the director of the shark lab at California State University Long Beach or jaws is a very famous movie from the twentieth century but here in the twenty first century it's much more helpful to think of it from the shark point of view as we'll watch the change in global temperature\nThis is the John ...

S. S.\n[noise] it looks that way yes and I think it makes sense\nTheir plan right now I mean if they get three ... launches on manned off before December and they pinpointed what the issue is and they've done some corrective it's you know checked the latest so used to make sure they don't have the same problem I don't see any reason why December cannot launch\nThey would have about a month leave wave the soy use that they would come back on\nIts life or its warranty runs out in January save a little bit of play that I should add by the way to things about space walks one\nThey're going to do the December space walk maybe in November to inspect the outside of that so I use because that's the one with the drill hole in it that was caused an leak that's one and two\nThe two astronauts said didn't get into space last week were trained to do all the maintenance off a space walks on I obsess\nAnd Russian said they want to launch them in the spring because they're trained to do space walks network needs to happen and so what we're looking at is not only will we not see a delay but the crew that just had this accident is going to probably be on a Russian a slow use very soon thereafter\nBobby you have the excitement of first man as a review on behind the black or I'm upbeat because that's a high point I think of this review I first met what is your\nFirst man was a was a biography written of Neil Armstrong has been now turned into a movie first manned by Hollywood and a few weeks ago you might remember there was a ... fold because\nUh the star of that movie Ryan Gosling has Canadian implied in an interview that the achievement was that Neal Neal Armstrong didn't consider this un American achievement it was a global achievement he didn't view themselves as an American hero\nCollectively quoting here and and it was in ... contact with him mentioning that they left out the scene in which the astronaut plant the American flag on the road and there was a big fuss align myself said that's really ridiculous this was an American achievement\nFor the world the world had nothing to do with it other than it's spurred us to us to do it\nUm and they got a lot of flak for it and bad publicity the director said no no no I never intended to reduce the American\nPresence I just wanted to focus on Neil Armstrong's personal story well you know I decided I haven't seen the film so my criticism was well maybe a little unfair so as soon as it came out I made an effort to find time to watch it and my wife and I went to see it a earlier this week\nAnd I have a review on behind the black and titles first land truly a triple lump trivialize the lunar landing because even though they do include the American flag out on the moon and they do include they you know it's very clearly an American achievement and they make some comments there and they're about how\nThis is an American a triumph um there's no question that the movie\nCompletely it a eliminated the Cold War aspect of it the American triumph the terror of\nAnd in that sense it it was so focused on Neil Armstrong's personal story\nA his personal in inner workings which I'm not sure I Believe in any way that they completely miss that greater epic tale which is one of the reasons the film falls flat and why it's not getting great word of mouth apparently the reason I don't think it's getting good word of mouth is that they portray all the astronaut\nIs all perfectly into\nGear when everyone works together your world gets better Hackensack Meridian how\nLife years\nNormally good

rockets and put sickness up to supply I says\nI'm a ... they become or tried to commercialize it a few years ago when they were trying to get customers well they've got a big customer now they picked

to put up many satellites are ... that kind\nOf thing um they uh been launching they've launched one successfully out of New Zealand they've got two more launches ... later this year this year from New Zealand if they those go well they're going to go really operational and twenty Nineteen and everything points than possibly launching once per week we live creeps up regularly\nThis is the rockets only slightly larger\nYou know significant larger than a model rocket but only within not very much difference and so they announced that they're going to make that first us based sport at Wal ups island\nAnd uh what this means is they want to be in a position that they have to launch sites where they can actually do as many as a hundred and thirty launches per year that's more than twice a week that's almost three times\nA month ... what does that yeah almost three times a week and that's how they said their goal was all along I ...

who can see the last months of the war\nAnd in their plans is Tom's death along with hundreds of thousands of young men hundreds of thousands the scale of the first war is difficult to imagine even the second war doesn't match\nThe slaughter that happened within days and hours of the launch of an offensive we'd go to a chateau at a place called\nBomb a shot told you bump all this is the headquarters of a man named folks who serves as the overall commander of the combined forces the British the Belgians than the Americans in the French\nHis personality is vital to understand because serving under him as a cat who is head of the French forces have had the British and pushing most especially of the fresh men on the field two hundred and fifty thousand Americans arriving per month\nThis is the summer of Nineteen Eighteen the expectation is that the war will last at least another year perhaps two years Churchill back home is preparing weapons systems because they're running out of men on the front and they don't believe they can launch it offensive and when this year because they've been bogged down for years and trench warfare\nAnd in competing barrage as Nick this meeting folks lays out what you describe as a battle plan\nFresh battle plan what's new about what does he say to these generals that inspire them that they can that they can win the next

wants to do is keep pressure on the front secure all I'm taking the rail hopes there's a ... on me all that's on the pressure and that's a key riled up sending the British\nUm sunny out they want to

John ... definitely was here and he's about to get into\nA war fought the German way against the Russians with their Austrian allies and they're going to use his terrier law that's an advantage the Germans have\nJeffrey you tell a wonderful story however the German troops are far more better trained sought better artillery better machine guns better generals and the Austrians and the Russians both who's armies will fall apart in the course of the years but there's a story that is just compelling to me Geoffrey all of us who\nEither wanted to read Greek or can read Greek or can identify with this man is shut a German soldiers so shell shocked by his fight in the west that when he's transferred to the east and fight again against the Russians you\nObserve in there's a source material that he did there staring at the ground reciting long passages of the odyssey and Greek is that a typical story of the shell shock in the front or is just to stand out among all the other sources\n[noise] well I got that and it goes from the memoirs of Harry Kessler and a customer observed that and\n... wrote that down and he said it was emblematic of the difference between the fighting on the western and the eastern friends in Nineteen forties he said the ... the western front\nWas so much more industrialized so much more intense\nThe concentration of of men machines artillery ... was it was so much more lethal than in the Eastern Front where things were spread out quite a bit more the armies were less heavily armed that the stronger and I was very deficient our children the Russian Army\nUh was better than the Austrians but compared with the Germans quite deficient as well plus the spaces where am I Would just much bigger so you had fewer\nYou if you are men and guns per square mile or kilometer\nSo you the the concentration of fire was with a\nAbsolutely mind bending on the western front and Kessler was was saying you know when they got replacements from the western front or when they moved divisions from the western front to the Eastern Front in Nineteen fourteen to bolster the uh to bolster the Austria Hungarian war effort\nThese guys that showed up where you know they had a much higher percentage of shell shocked guys than\nThan a German or Australia years there's been serving throughout on the Eastern Front but this explains\nWhy Annenberg and looting door\nThought that it made sense to try to win the war in the east\nNot in the west and they were always disputing with most of the younger and then fall can high above the focus of the war\nOr they ... north thought it was impossible to get on the western front because\nThe British and French which is to industrialized\nThe uh the the the British industry and subsidies we're creating a you know incredibly a solid trench works lots of artillery lots of Shell's yes there is a shell shores beginning of the war but the correct this\nAnd then they become stronger and stronger throughout and in the ... or so we can't break through on the western front because these western allies are still well armed the Russians on the other hand\nWe can break through there because there's more space is more space for maneuver and the Russians are pathetically armed versus the the British and the French or they were they were fairly well armed at the outset but then they're blockaded throughout by\nThe by the Germans in the in the Baltic to close the Baltic ports in the Turks who joined the central powers ah they closed the the Black Sea port so the Russians\nSo the Russians aren't able to get in any machinery and not able to get any artillery but not able to get it and he shows\nOr or or or bullets for the rifles in fact a throughout the war about one third of the troops in any given Russian unit have rifles two thirds attack without rifles and pick up\nRifles from out and that was a reason for the Germans to launch the war in the first place I Believe I read you correctly they knew the Russians eventually would be better armed and so they had to move now before it became impossible\nYeah and they probably and they and they didn't they didn't realize how just how badly they were on that they didn't realize it was as bad as it seemed\nAnd so in Nineteen fourteen Fifteen and then you know Nineteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen is well\nA or a Hindu Annenberg looting or say look we have to seek decision on the Eastern Front because they are the Russians are big but they're ramshackle we kicked the door and the whole thing will fall down whereas we can't punch through in the west once we take the Russians out and we either conquer them\nAltogether or we force them to make a separate piece with us we can then focus everything on the western front or we can defeat the French and\nBritish Hynden burg and looting Dorothy is to work together and they will take over everything eventually and Seventeen and Eighteen but here they build an austere in eastern army of twelve core six more coming and they attacked the Russians and roll up and Norman's numbers of prisoners dead and ... are dead and wounded\nAnd killed in five hundred thousand they just roll right through the Russians\nAnd they want Conrad to work with them to attack from the south looting door for furious at Conrad because he won't he's ineffective a and at this point\nIs losing door thinking about taking over Conrad's army he will will eventually but he did he think at this early November\nWell they'd been the ... the Germans were were effectively taking it over in the sense that they were increasingly coming up with ideas and increasingly a compelling Conrad to execute those ideas going over his head to the emperor in Vienna he refused but the problem the problem was is that you know you have the Germans on the left\nAnd the center and then they have the Austrians in the center and all the way down in the right so if you're going to have a big operation where you try to roll up the enemy flank the Austrians really have to participate because the Austrian because the Russians are so numerous a and but it the the Austrian is just that whenever they attack\nTheir blown backed by the Russians and they and they lack the artillery they lack the infantry tactics to actually launch an effective attack and get through the Russians so they make these half hearted effort to join these German offensives in the east but every time\nThere stymied thrown back and then the Germans are left fighting alone without if Franken Austria Hungarian Army to assist them\nA sidebar to what's going on in the battle France and the enormous casually numbers\nI just introduced me to what looks to be a fresh information about what happened to the Jews in the Austrian Hungarian empire that by the Nineteen thirties Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties they were scapegoating by such as the national socialist\nThe dislocation of the Jewish villages in ... is co tournament is with these offensive actions the enormous numbers of armies marching through the blasting and the threat those Jews are what they're they they travel naturally to Vienna for support is that correct Jeff and that's where\nThe Jews have to live again having been driven out of their villages and they participate in the black market and then\nYou know the the ... show was the
