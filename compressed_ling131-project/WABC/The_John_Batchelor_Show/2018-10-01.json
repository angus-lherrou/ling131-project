see New York [laughter] the following program is paid for by purity products the following of hate advertisement by purity products these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA whose product is not intended to diagnose treats cure or prevent any diseases [noise]\nHello and welcome to the show I'm your host Campbell we've got a fascinating program for you today or yesterday says that they're used to use a molecule in the human body and he says this molecule abuse happens to be concentrated in our skin\nHair eyes and joins he says this substance not only dramatically influences our parents and the words how young are how healthy we look but more importantly aren't physical strength or flexibility mobility\nIs our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it\nAs we get older I here's our gas to health or journalists to bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\n... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan\nWhere people maintain high levels of aging and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because\nThere's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is is that we use this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word high ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H hey it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on\nAll of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into that they certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints H H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space between\nThe two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we started getting problems the more that we find pain relief the\nMore pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nDermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign modern medicine but\nIt may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplements purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million dolphins and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives\nOr their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing\nThe water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that\nAll of our cells that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates\nAnd then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together and of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eyes and so on all of these things occur with age and you know positive daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and\nOf course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies or even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so\nAt certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose it we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nAre going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking Luke ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it\nWell it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are going to take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts\nWith patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these youthful levels of ha restored in their body", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "01"}
