county sheriff Mike straw to sing homeowners supporting congressman Josh Gottheimer in Hampton woke up last month swastikas spray painted on garage doors and campaign lawn signs\nA a treaty in place so that their major export market was still in place a and so they had to come to the table I really just thought it was a matter of time but I also thought it was incredibly important to have\nA when if you want to look at it that way and I do before the midterm elections because let's face it Donald Trump has gone after they eat you and a China and our partners in NAFTA\nA and practically everybody else in the sun and you can only do that so long without people saying where's the bacon where's the beef and\nFinally he brought home the bacon this deal I think\nA is quite a good one it does give our dairy farmers greater access to Canada without getting into the weeds there was a sort of and run that dairy farmers had done around uh the terrorists in Canada which are on average about two hundred and Seventy percent\nBut then Canada block that access and so this now is on blocked and our dairy farmers will be able to export more to Canada\nI'm also poultry and eggs are those um products also are going to be more freely flowing north uh and then the other big thing of course as automobiles and the supply chains being kept in place a Trump did push through an increased\nA local content regulation which is really to keep\nA ... auto parts from coming from Germany or China and basically sort of wheeling their way into the United states because they come from a NAFTA country\nAh so I I also like the fact that this deal that it's a sixteen year duration it can be reviewed every six years if something isn't right it can be adjusted and then it can be renewed for another sixteen years so\nYou know if you're running a big company you need that certainty invisibility and I think this new arrangement provides that ... a candidate did get to keep the the process resolution\nUm arrangement that they wanted I don't think that's a huge deal a so all on the ... it seems to me looking at it for several weeks now this really was about as good as it could\nGet and if you use necessary for the Congress to approve this next year and that's why I Believe that the attention to detail about where the cars must be manufactured\nAnd how much of it must be manufactured in the high wage countries of Canada in the United states I Believe that to anticipate being of the Democratic votes\nAbsolutely ... this is what Trump campaigned on he wanted to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United states this will help that because amongst other things that does require higher wages to be paid in countries like Mexico or or actually specifically in Mexico\nWhich gives them less of an advantage now\n... you know how this all sorts out in terms of international competition auto makers are going to have to figure out how to uh not let their costs go way up so that become uncompetitive that's the flip side of raining in this kind of outsourcing to Mexico and other cheap labor markets\nBut you know what they're going to have to do that and probably they'll do it partly through automation which may\nUh remove some of the advantages for American workers but going forward I think the important thing was to get a deal inked now we have that and now Trump can turn its attention to the eight you enter Japan the big issue as we have discussed before\nOr one of the big issues anyway is getting all of our trading partners\nAgreement that the WTO needs to be reformed\nTo rein in the bad practices of China China is still treated as a developing nation also the WTO has no rules that regulate the kind of state owned enterprises that figure so largely in China's economy they\nCan cheat legally if you will because the WTO has no rules to prevent them from doing that it's incredibly important we get that done and I think now that's what Lighthizer and these guys are going to turn their attention to\nLose I've been having conversations about doing business in China with people who travel there frequently it is surprising and dumped founding to hear how aggressive the Chinese capitalists are in shaking down and pirating and leaning on anyone doing business in China\nYou just surprising and discouraging to hear how the Chinese government offers free factories\nTo ah to companies to invest in China to bring businesses to China and those free factories become the hook where your your prey to the supply chain it is surprising an alarming Liz do understand that citizens who traveled to China are routinely minded and watched and persecuted and must\nVery careful about how these to be I Do not believe that the Trump Administration has done a good job here communicating to the American people that China is not a capitalist state ... its piracy and it brutalizes anybody who does business there\nWell I think you raise a really good points but by the way that's going on for Twenty years I mean this is not a new issue\nI remember reading a book ten or Fifteen Years ago about a fellow doing business in China and he laid out all the things you've talked about how it works how you go in set up shop at a local partner two years later you find that local partners taken you know how and built an exact replica of your plant down the road and it's under selling you it isn't\nIt there is nothing honest about the way people do business in China I don't think that's an exaggeration\nAmericans go in there because of the way we are brought up because the way our economy works expecting fair play they do not get that\nAnd at a ... you know their secrets or stolen it by the way the first study on that intellectual property theft that we've all talked so much about that was done in two thousand three again these are not new problems the good news in my view is that Donald Trump is finally\n... uh businesses and the country to stand behind him as he confronts China because by the way the stakes have gotten significantly higher\nWe're not talking about a country that is knocking off the way we make T shirts anymore now the country is knocking off\nAre very most sophisticated artificial intelligence our programming or chip companies everything else they want to dominate they've made it they have a program laid out and try and called made in China twenty twenty five\nThey wanted dominate high tech and they will use pirated a means to accomplish that goal so I agree with you a hundred percent I think it's\nAlarming but it's not surprising ... the only thing that surprising is the way businesses react after they'd been in China for a couple of years they find out that they've been duped but you know what the good news is the message is getting out\nUh I don't you know I think that ah the chamber of commerce crew has finally figured out that this is not a place where they're going to make a lot of money because China won't let them and and they are perfectly the the interesting thing is a little bit culturally it's perfectly OK in China you're supposed to be brass knuckles fighters\nFor your company and your enterprise and that's what they are\nAnd yet our lives is popular known that if the PLO you're dealing with when it comes to technology and high tech and intellectual property use it properly known that wall way is a function of the pie LA\nThey're they're they're spies their their their their Rob everything they touch is that popularly known I I'm not sure I I'm I'm kind of was dumbfounded as to what I've just been listening to\nI don't think ah no I don't think it's well known but I Do think as if it's frankly if people read the news with any care they will find out\nMore and more about what's going on in China you know for years I Would occasionally get an email from some university professor saying we had a Chinese delegation come to visit our University of Michigan Tech lab or whatever\nAnd I'm pretty sure that those guys stole documents that was just routine we had I mean honestly I don't think anything has been safe or sacred and our dealings with the Chinese I Do think people are waking up to it and by the way now again as to the stakes having been increased\nWe also have these confrontations in the south China Sea which are getting a little more attention now very alarming a nachos to Americans but to the entire region I I mean I you know this is a country and particularly under is easing paying\nA who has been become incredibly aggressive and aggressive on all fronts militarily economically et cetera the good news is what you do hear coming back is the Chinese are afraid of Donald Trump they think that he is\nUnbridled a and aggressive and he that he really does mean business so was it that really will provoke any kind of changing their behavior I don't\nKnow us MCA alarm them lose what you read of that I mean they they believe they could buy your I guess they think they can buy Canada as well\nI think that's true I I think they felt that\nThat Donald Trump was sort of a blunder bus and he was sort of wrecking all these trade arrangements making people angry all over so they had instituted a charm offensive particularly with the e you trying to make sure that we did not partner with the EU which Japan with South Korea\nIn trade agreements and again with reforming the WTO in ways that would disadvantage\nThat Chinese I think they were very\nUh ... I think they were optimistic remember\nSpelled B O L L and branch dot com promo code job B O L L and branch dot com promote jobs and the\nGuy a dog\nSomebody ... mostly\nYoung Bob rounds of stories will be talking about on Seventy seven WABC severe thunderstorms movies in ... reports of trees down and parts of northern Westchester and rock and counties\nMars with a woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh circle misconduct to their client has not been interviewed as part of the eyes investigation into her claims corresponding someone's body as part of a letter from the attorney\nAnd this letter they write in part it is inconceivable that the FBI\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses have identified in our letter\nTransit advocates demanding funding beat his job was for the city subway system at the state level through congestion pricing speaking at a rally in Union Square Rebecca bailing on the runners alliance says the responsibility to fix the subway lines with Governor Cuomo\nThese powerful person he's the only person you can find anything\nRequired into the MPA\nHere's the regime was Seventy seven WABC\nYou mentioned those problems including strong thunderstorms in the northern suburbs and that's what we God shows him down trees now north found six eighty four ... and five in Bedford ... block they're also ... one twenty inch ... several down trees on that highway\nAnd also watch where some downed trees and branches ... one twenty nine in your channel does in Westchester County\nEverything's moving across the Tappan Zee bridge in good shape but they do have reduced speed limits there and the other Hudson River crossings Lincoln ...

S. M. C. A. this is the new agreement for North America the three democracies of North America Larry a very good evening to you and congratulations to you and everyone at the Trump Administration\nWho delivered Canada to fit in with the jet solve puzzles that is North America along with Mexico\nI Want to speak to the facts to the U. S. MCA a ... ... ... and in a moment but first trade coalition of the willing it has the ring of a Kudlow invention what does it mean Larry good evening to\nGet anything done wonderful will be back well look quite simply um what you're seeing now with our our called them renewed relations trade relations with the European\nUnion and Japan are we by the wayside their tribe apartheid agreement at the un meetings last week a forming a coalition are against all the um Chinese missteps\nIllegals\nProtections feeling you know I ... ... technology transfers are terrorists than non tariff barriers so it spells it out very plainly that's the first time the big powers a huge fan of us I've actually come together in a statement\nA which was issued up at the un um bats are Lighthizer not one for the press as soon as we got it okay that was a major move and then of course quickly this week we moved to the\nUs MCA I learn how to say that you are right called NAFTA which is actually quite an extensive agreement I'm not sure boats appreciate what's gone on\nThe problem is China right that's the center of the broken trading system and we are now on the same page uh in fact that even that the Canadian prime minister Trudeau with President Trump in a in a phone call yesterday I\nTalked about how to deal with um unfair trade practices from outside North America so everybody's pretty much on the same track right now and I I think it's a terrific turn for the better and um it bodes well this is you know hard going\nTrade negotiations probably the toughest thing I've ever seen but nonetheless\nWe are in prosperity and I believe these trade deals are going to help grow that prosperity and I'm trying to get the message I Can't be sure but out they do\nI'm counting Larry twenty eight countries in the European Union ah UK I'm going to include in the twenty eight for the moment Japan and the three countries of North America that's thirty two altogether thirty two democracies\nAre at this point stating that China that you must mend your ways that you are in violation of the WTO\nLarry there's no exaggerating China they have been brutal towards everyone for the last decades decades this is an old problem that the Trump Administration inherited\nFrom the Bush the Clinton the Bush and the Obama administration and you're the first team that stood up to China and China is speechless at this point thirty two democracies saying no more\n[noise] yes well it's a very important the way you put that some people are blaming President Trump a for using all his means\nThat disposal including tariffs that's always part of negotiations but the reality is don't plain Trump he inherited this\nAnd he's trying to fix it you'd like to get rid of tariffs and non tariff barriers and so forth are have you'd like to have fair trade again these are like that reciprocal trade and he liked to have China play by the rules which they do not do and having for about Twenty years or as you mentioned other presidents\nHave mentioned it but they always back off a President Trump has the backbone of my full support in this and I think you know\nWe may come out of this on the other side and very good shape it may be a tremendous balloons the world economy but it's very important that the allies I've got a call the allies John huge and us\nMexico and Canada make their trade deal we upgraded and modernize NAFTA now or we're making our trade deal and we're making our statement and I can only hope that China will listen we're willing to negotiate it off to China\nIn any serious way so far it's been quite unsatisfactory but we'll see\nLarry China's violation of the WTO is not the whole of it this piracy practiced with brutal tactics that anybody trying to do business in China\nTheft of intellectual property is part of it but also everyone going to China is watch there's intimidation this is not the China Hu Jintao not that China does the beginning of the century this says Xi Jinping's a\nTyranny in practice now also being aggressive geopolitically the confrontation with the USS Decatur these last days I Believe that what you at the Trump Administration are doing is not only talking about trade Larry you're talking about piece of the planet you're talking about a a rogue nation that has to be\nThat has to comply with international law limits\nWell look I'm not at China scholar I'm learning fast on the job but I Will say that the brilliant reforms both the market reforms the\nOr in this regard it's the issue of the court appointments issue that excites Republicans more than Democrats or the idea that Kavanaugh would not be put out a Supreme Court would be Shanghai hijacked at the last minute then they Republicans bad Johnny can already see the results and something about red states are in Senate races as to how Kevin places that's not good news for Democrats\nThe expectation here I'm just following common denominator is that Kavanaugh has alarmed a those in suburban districts are one by Hillary Clinton\nThat would be in the house side as opposed to the Senate side can the numbers you're looking at make the distinction between voting locally for the CD and voting statewide for the Senate\nYeah what you see the polarization where are the Democrats numbers with women are strictly a I looked for example in Nevada Senate race there Dean Heller is a Republican incumbent trying to seek re election or maybe the only Republican incumbent to lose and that's because there was an enormous gender gap warming of that state jobs\nIt leads among men by about four points but he trails by women by fourteen\nBut we look at more predominantly red states across America\nAnd here the Democrats have problems I was looking at the north Dakota for example today I kept a democratic senator up for reelection Kevin O's approval they're sixty percent of North Dakota and they should be put on the court um they look at the issue is North Dakota's care about most of the sour jobs it's cabin on\nThe far leads the economy who Farley healthcare here far leads immigration so that's a problem for I'm proud of the high camp you go to West Virginia John and there's a problem for Joe mansion the state that Donald Trump doesn't get five times in part to put pressure\nOn ... situations like this is Mitch votes for cabinet John or straw poll I missed it says that he'll win this race by about twenty five to thirty points but if he votes against cabinet John that lead shrinks to all of two points so very simple for any votes for cabinet game over fifty votes against kept a game on so\nThis is a very problematic calculation red state Democrats right now\nOne more twist spell I've been told by David truck or my colleague at Washington Examiner that a democratic operative mentioned to him last week sort of mumbles out of the side of his mouth ironically that the thing to fear from the Democrats as an empty seat on November sixteenth on the court does that make sense to you\nA political operative\nUm in other words Kevin ... is not confirmed and the Supreme Court remains an eight seats and that the future is unknown and the this democratic operative was anxious because that would encourage your reaction from the Republicans I guess we're already seeing it it doesn't have to be empty\nYeah it does not to be empty I it's it's I think it's two things here number one just the way they've played this game in the last minute dropping those commission on him that sixth extremely personal that frustrates Republicans but secondly John when you look at survey after survey what motivates Republicans and Democrats the Supreme Court is a\nBigger issue for Republicans and Democrats plain and simple so ah the issue of America ... for example you would think Democrats would have been so enraged to twenty sixteen about miracle and\nIt turned out numbers to punish Donald Trump Republicans but that didn't happen but they're twenty Eighteen this issue does drive Republicans loopholes\nTurnout in Texas this is Beto O'Rourke congressman and Ted Cruz a senator and I keep seeing pictures on Twitter of these enormous crowds so has something changed from the red state of Texas\nBeto O'Rourke is sort of the beautiful cat people's candidate and the great state of Texas He's doing big rallies Willie Nelson as jamming at his rallies and it's all kind of a great progressive could buy a moment\nBut here's the problem bitter or work is very popular of Willie Nelson he likes to go on the likes of bill ... Bill Maher show on HBO but it remains to be a state of Texas is a progressive there's a month ago and that race Ted Cruz is going to spend a lot of money as they try to introduce federal uh work at a very negative light to Texas voters\nBut the simple diverge your voting a Texas John where there's a governor's race sitting on top of the Senate race\nThe governor Abbott very popular incumbent Republicans seeking reelection feel when I was raised by Fifteen to twenty points it's very difficult job to go for a Republican wedding by Fifteen or twenty two a Democrat upsetting Republican incumbents so I don't think Texas what's the time but it's just a narrative that the media love the idea of Texas somehow being democratic\nYou remind all of us that the voting is already underway does that favor either side [noise]\nUm it it's ominous for Republicans in Florida in particular where you look at Miami Dade County which Democrats need to uh to win the gubernatorial Senate races in that state and turnout is up sharply or I should say the request early palaces up shortly so that\nThat his arm of the Republicans to look at the question of your of your walk up voter fueled the day folks now this is the Trump strategy and twenty sixteen not to put a lot of trust in the early voting the Clinton campaign did the Trump campaign daughter would get a large walk up voting succeeded very well for them so the question is can Republicans do it again and twenty Eighteen\n... it's very hard to do in mid term elections\nDrunk we also turned to the year of the woman or the look for the woman you mentioning near for peace now there is a woman candidate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn but she's facing a centrist Democrat at least it he passes for a centrist these days\nPhil Bredesen so are the advantages to women when their democratic candidates and not to Republican when they're women candidates\nYeah it could work that way for Republicans does it and that's in part because of the so called war woman trope is the Democratic trope a Marsha Blackburn\nHas a couple of problems of one is that she is part of the system she's part of Washington and former governor brightest and it's not so he's running as an outsider secondly it's interesting you look at her on the stump in terms of talking about accomplishments in Washington She's not talking about number one thing that the house has done this year which was a tax cut cheese you start bringing that up\nThe decision is made at the major networks that the evening shows especially the show that is popular on CBS I Believe I don't watch them bill I might get this wrong it's going to cover the election as if they're the election desk is this a good thing for the Democrats or a confusing things for voters in general\nUh this is the Daily Show we're talking about which that on the comedy channel at a Comedy Central and this is a bad thing for Republicans I think we're at large jock like several things have come along in the past twenty five thirty years what you've just absolutely poison the well politically one obviously being the Internet and the editor Twitter and so forth which makes you know\nCowards acting more cowardly um but I think also the advent of John Stewart too I have nothing personal against the gets but the problem is this is where young people turn for quote unquote news and information\nAnd he's an entertainer none ... so young people from their political views on board has very snide sarcastic reporting it makes them more cynical about the process so I Would just encourage young people just look elsewhere for them they just don't buy into the service of the\nBill in the next days the Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate says that he's going to bring Kavanaugh for a vote on the floor of the Senate up or down at this point I don't have any special information\nIs that going to be forgotten issue the way we forgot that op ed in the New York times about somebody inside the Trump Administration trying to undermine the president ... the way we've run forgotten about all the other scandals unless they're in front of a sad day are we going to forget Kavanaugh\nYou're just on my line I was gonna say John two weeks ago you and I are pondering who wrote that in order to start writing the ... and\nNow I watch I Know I think Kavanaugh sticks because I think this gets hard of a of a central question Republicans the idea of the court the idea of legislative from the bench as something that really does to find the right versus the west so I don't think this one goes away as a campaign issue\nAnd therefore the vote on friday will be remembered both sides will use it in advertising they'll pound is with ed Kavanaugh if Kavanaugh forever the court goes away but Kavanaugh is with us is that it\nOr they cabinets with this job because Kevin I worked very well for the Democrats the terms of votes in the house in terms of suburban districts and the women's vote but it works very well for Republicans and red state so you know what is the Donald Trump thinks he can always get what you what you get what you need both parties get what they need\nFinal

I took off about ten days or to work at a project [noise]\nAnd I followed by the way you were\nHere in the background if you hear it [noise]\nIt's not the police come in or I I think it's an area that I write this\nJob just kids match Dave we're talking about alarm bells\nExactly but just one word on script Paul who appears last ... ah making these statements I've always thought\nThat the argument that the Kremlin ordered him assassinated made no sense for a very old fashioned reason when your intelligence agency or their intelligence agency\nRecruit someone to be a spot and go to the other country they always say if you get caught we will get you out\nYou may sit in jail for five years we will leave you to arrive and that's how the swaps came about right John\n... fall was recruited some time in Nineteen Ninety six by an unknown\nAnd he was exchanged in the twenty first century and we get and the British gave back one of their recruits there was a it was an even exchange and he was living peacefully we're told under the protection of the British Government\nBut the point here is is that if\nThe side that swaps\nThe spy then tries to kill the spy when is biased safely on the other side the whole validity of the intelligence services saying the person we will get you out is not about five it it undermines recruitment\nAnd ... watch a career intelligence\nOfficer would notice more than any body so it never made any sense a and it still doesn't make any sense\nBut let's go to what unfortunately seems to make sense to me and that is the new Cold War and you and I started calling him that the new Cold War almost five years ago it's not so new it's been getting worse\nWow we've been distracted by judge Kavanaugh\nAll in all the astonishing exploits of his high school years but when you go back and look at what's happened just during that Kavanaugh hearings in the new Cold War it's really astonishing the extremism\nThat's come over the American political class policymakers I find\nExtremely alarming you gave us some\nExamples in your broadcast a threatening to attack Russian missile sites yeah take out take a hike up that was done by the American ambassador to NATO right ... it wasn't somebody on the pension down in you know the morning forgive me Des Moines\nBut that's a very high ranking and militarized figure\nThe ambassador to NATO um we have I think you also said that a number\nOf the United states government secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke right yeah\nFor threat certainly in naval blockade against Russia that's threatening war\nYou have Senator John we've forgotten them but two weeks ago they were promising and they're working on today quote\nCrippling economic sanctions against Russia that's called economic war so you're getting these definitions of war I Want to give you one example\nThe pains me a little but it's so last trip that I think we have to realize what's happened to our policy will eat I've known Michael McFaul for many years and he's a very nice guy\nBut it's got to be said that he was Bible Haitian a former professor of Russian studies at Stanford University a very prominent university and later President Obama's not only Russia hand in the White House but his ambassador to Moscow for two years\nSo this is this may be the leading public American authority on Russia at least the media treat seem that way a diplomat and I've asked her a scholar\nHe is now saying because one counts on people like in the fall to stay calm and to avoid extremism but he is now saying\nA an article in the Washington Post on September twenty eight just a few days ago won Russia's now the greatest threat in the entire world the greatest threat that the only way to react to enact permanent escalating sanctions that will automatically\nUh be emblematic whatever Russia does something wrong in other words this is from that warfare it's not sanctions\nDirected at anything but it's a whole new policy of punting the escalating sanctions and he gives one example than I I don't know why is editors didn't query him about this but he says it every day Russia\nHelps the rebels and the boss region of Ukraine where there's a civil war sanctions should escalate so three hundred and sixty five days a year sanctions should ask to escalate on Russia that this is a form of extremism\nMaybe McFaul didn't need it but it reflects what's come over our political class in regard to Russia and I find it uh I almost unprecedented one thing that should be added here\nI don't know if there's an outlaw in history maybe it wasn't McCarthy Era but this thing we call\nRussia gate I think you'd agree John ... didn't exist when you when I started under the rule book of the new Cold War in two thousand and four to you\nKnow it was invented entirely after the election of twenty six the entire\nWell I I Would argue a little bit it was growing before the election because you remember Mrs Clinton during the debate into sixteen called Trump ... so this story was already out there we know that the famous dot C. A. Y. Christopher Steele of so called\nHigh crumbling dirt on truck was being leaked to the media to sixteen that's ... yeah and through through the FBI but the point I Want to make here is that ... when historians look back\nAnd write the history of this Cold War and this is sue that when this Cold War colon age are still will be historians but it doesn't become a nuclear war or when they write it the way we've been writing a history of the other ... which is a big\nHistorical industry new books with pure all the time they're going to note and maybe be amazed by the fact that Russia has become part of the Cold War in two senses\nIn effect for weight Trump can and cannot make policy toward Russia but Russia gate to the extent that it's believed in this country\nAnd I guess the numbers are about fifty fifty\nPeople who believe Russia in demonize is Russia because it uses Russia all having\nAttacked us during the presidential election into sixteen and now this is a point I Want to make [noise] we have a series of publication\nIn New York Times ten thousand a supplement in the Washington Post less than five thousand words in the New Yorker magazine by Jane there are various steamed reporter\nWhere the story has changed our remember in the beginning it was Russia had metal in our election\nToo which I said sure yeah Jay walking or both sides of metal than the others elections for a hundred years what's the big deal it's a different story now they are now saying flat out there who put Trump in the White House\nProfessor Stephen F Cohen New York university at Princeton University we continue I'm John bachelor this was the John bachelor show\n[noise]\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets but the United states has master hackers to the best one of the IRA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly spy look like\nIn fight former intelligence agent Eric Anderson page turning new thriller the tables are turned in big powers cyberwarfare\nEric Anderson new novel from done book this fight B.

Cohen is here we're discussing the new Cold War the incidents of these last week's including of course the last ... hours when an ambassador to NATO indicated that the U.S might have to take out Russian intermediaries intermediate missiles\nIn violation of the start treaty and a member of the cabinet said the U.S might work does have the capability of black hating\nRussian energy supplies that would be a crippling the nation and an act of war she was discussing the miss understanding between Israel and Russia that happened to immediately after the shoot down to the Russian and surveillance craft\nWhere the prime minister was eager to\nA calm the waters and the president of Russia was in a position of having many voices in his ears some of which were ready to react immediately please continue to\nProve his first reaction was to be conciliatory and excuse Israel say oh it was just such as the war zone in Syria\nIt shows how dangerous it is mistakes get made I don't know if you use the expression fog of war but that's how Russian media interpreted his state\nThat couldn't didn't blame it on Israel but on the fog of war his own military said absolutely not Israel fully responsible the prime minister of Israel the ... and his defense minister Lieberman wanted to fly to Moscow that\nDay I imagine is now John they wanted to see proof and persuade them of some ... said no you can't come\nAnd the reason you can't come you didn't say this was is that I Can't let you come in light of what my military is saying is that\nYou are responsible so instead Israel sent a low level military delegation the upper shot was is that who switched\nPositions and adopted the position either because he was persuaded by the evidence the ministry of defense gaming or be caused his political position wasn't tenable Fifteen Russians had died that's not nothing John\nFifteen Americans die having come we don't pay attention in Afghanistan but if they died at rushing hands someplace there would be an uproar in this country\nAnd I believe in it included a general officer who was a ... a prominent in Russian defence industry and we're talking specialists and surveillance aircraft these were not ... uh they were to these were not draftees\nI wrecked so we're looking at an incident that has been a blow to the Russian military no matter who did it in the Syrian citizens Dave but the Russian reaction has been halfway belligerent to then say we're going to deploy as three hundred which is unbelievably different capability than the U.S two hundred that shot down the the surveillance craft\nShow now put and has to make a decision\nIt would appear\nThat he was being told by some members of his military\nBecause they blamed Israel for having position the planes as it did and having done it on purpose\nThat Russia's shoot down a few Israeli plane was in short I mean they wanted really aggressive action\nWho was going to do that but the decision he made is ram a fine and we ought to talk about what it means if we know what it means for many years Syria and also by the way Iran has wanted this\nAir surface to air defense system known as the S. three hundred which\nAre now there appear to be an older and newer variant of this and the report is is that ... having made the decision\nNow at last after three years four years of Syria asking for it to give this system to ... Russians will operate not sure what it's a powerful system we don't have anything like it\nExperts agree that it has multiple if the capacity to shoot down multiple aircraft over something like I don't know two hundred and fifty five hundred I mean it has an enormous range\nIn fact\n... could declare a no fly zone over this area of Syria now so this changes everything\nBecause the Americans are operating mirror Iranians are operating there the Israelis are this is a very big decision for who he so far as I Know has never given any country\nThere is also for hundreds system which the Chinese one and you may give it to the Chinese but that's a separate relationship uh Americans are not in a Chinese combat so\nSteve I talked with them is a former Israeli generally now leads the think tank in Tel Aviv\nAnd he indicated the as three hundred system if deployed and there's some question whether it will be deployed because they've talked this way before if deployed would be in the hands of Russian agents only not given to the Syrians\nThat still doesn't solve the possibility of accident but it does remove the possibility that there'll be another incident such as a couple of weeks back there was a twist here\nIf that system is deployed around or in the vicinity of Iranian missile factories which I Believe was the target for the Israeli air raid that led to the Syrians firing missiles in all directions\nThat means that the Russians will being a being a place where they have to decide if they're going to stand down\nPending an Israeli air raid it's not a good story Steve it's not going to need fashion\nWell let's look at first of all is look at the\nPolitical applications it means now officially that Russia has become the protectorate of sharing a correct

War we've been catching up over these last week an item that does not\nFeature in a headline yet is that the U.S coast guard at the direction of the president and the Trump Administration is deploying to one hundred and ten foot long patrol craft one ... they carry a weapon in front and their warships if your a smuggler\nJew you Ukraine why there is a place called the sea of as a ... what is the CEO of ads off why is it now going to become a battle space between Russian NATO\n[noise] so this is geography of Russia annexed Crimea which is a connection with no\nNatural land border with Russia except through Ukraine and the Ukraine border has been closed\nSo Russia has had to supply Crimea it's very expensive either by air or sea about four months ago folks might have seen the TV footage of it it was very dramatic\nRussia's been building I think is fourteen mile bridge I don't know if it's the longest bridge in the world is a very long bridge\nFrom southern Russia to Crimea and it's going to have as I understand it three bridges actually won for automobiles one for trucks and one will be for trains the one for\nTrucks I think I've got this right open five months ago\nAnd putting drove the first truck truck a trunk of a truck across the one for automobiles so like if I wanted to go to Russia and visit Crimea I can now drive\nA wouldn't have to fly a that's to be open and I think being rail bridge is probably about Eighteen months away that means that the port of ...\nNow you and I talked about you or you will remember this\nI Do remember there was an offensive a drunk driving and marry oh pull that right a big guns rattled in those last week of the hot\nMore well that's right into fourteen when the civil war began\nA following the fall of Ukraine's president I mean by Don square and the uprising Marie ... was taken by the rebels is a very very important seaport maybe the most important in Ukraine I'm not sure but it's very very important and\nThe rebels held it for about two weeks and then the Ukrainian army controlled by Kiev took it back and controls it today [noise]\nSo since the bridge has been Russia has become very interested in the sea lanes of Mary ... which sits on the sea about his off which is a tributary of the black sea the whole region is the black sea\nUh Russia has been moving warships and I guess these little boats whatever you call them these patrol boats into the area and it's been stopping certain vibe bearing ships and examining what's on board and Ukrainian Turkish\nFrench I think Russia has said so said this is our water now are ... and and legal or if it stays a certain number of miles from Mary ... borders or whatever it's three miles or twelve miles but it's been a\nRandomly stopping ships the president of Ukraine ... who has single digit support and is up for reelection quite soon in March I think of next year has declared he's going to confront\nA\nIn the eyes off the Russia with his naval power of which Ukraine doesn't have much they've got some ships and these two ships that the United states sent to Ukraine you told me John really aren't worth vessels or patrolled though\nRight unless you're a ... unless you're a smuggler no they wouldn't have thought of another warship\nBut the significance of this\nIn my mind is it's been dangerous enough in Ukraine but it's been frozen\nThe fighting has been going on in done boss off the line that divides a gun boss from Kiev controlled Ukraine has meant that the fighting has been spilled into this other part of Ukraine civil war has been kind of remote\nFrom people that goes on people die every day uh the Kiev army still shells during the day when kids go to school they're not supposed to\nAn all reports say that they do they're all sorts of proposals to end this war but this is an escalation because it now could become a war at sea and ... which is ... I'm not sure I pronounce it that you and Mary ...\nIs terribly terribly important and Russia will now uh bring pressure to bear there\nAs it feels it has a right and Ukraine depending on what Washington as a will do something so we can see here now on water John\nAh the un Adam ration of foreshadowing other kind of catastrophe that took place in September in Syria [noise] uh where people died now in this case it's Ukrainian and Russians\nDo the difference between them as often hard to tell most Russians most Ukrainians speak Russian uh as well as Ukrainian so this is a new emerging\nHot spot in the new Cold War and it couldn't get much worse very quickly depending on what Trump to us and here is a question in my mind that we probably won't discuss tonight and you probably know the answer better than I Do\nWho is making these policies in Washington\nBecause Trump clearly\nDoesn't want a war for ... soup with Russia\nAnd yet look at all the quotations and examples that you cited today and recording by officials of the American government they're very warfare\nTrump clearly is not in control of Russia policy in Washington so why we have this new and I think more dangerous Cold War we have an almost unprecedented situation in Washington\nWhere the president whatever we think about him\nIs not in control entirely at least a policy toward Russia which raises the question who then is just to post script and I'll quit you'll remember I'm sure they didn't to sixteen President Obama got it in his mind to cooperate with Russia against terrorists in Syria\nAnd they struck an agreement secretary of defense carry went to Moscow note with gluten they shook hands\nIt was destroyed by the department of defense which attacks Syrian troops and that was the end of that so it's not without precedent conflict or opposition or perhaps sabotage that President Trump faces when he tries to quote cooperate with Russia\nDavid detail here to mention for another week but perhaps oil is above eighty a above eighty five and I'm told by people who watch it as professionals that it's headed towards a hundred dollars food and is not in a bad way if all goes to a hundred dollars do you agree we have thirty seconds\nRussia's federal budget is in the plush\nWhere the oil at sixty this is this is world prices not American prices for Russia is well above that now but I Will ask you a question of water in the world would possess this minister as the secretary of the American interior to threaten a naval blockade against\nSo having to do with the export of energy it sounds like economic competition by work for me it has nothing to do with anything he just said he didn't want Russia shipping enters its\nA very strange from our guy I Will look into it professor professor Stephen F Cohen New York university Princeton University it's good to have him back on air we had a lot of where there are a lot more incidents to recover but we've done the best we can for the first week\nI'm John bachelor this is the John ... [noise]\nJamie progress is number one number two employee and I said\nHey Jamie Jamie [noise] this is your daily pep talk I Know it's been rough going ever since people found out about your capella group Matt harmony but you will bounce back I mean you're the guy always helping people find coverage options with an enterprise tool it shouldn't be you giving me the pep talk now get out there hit that high note and take mad harmony\nMichael I Want to go through some complaints that I find in the news as Amazon does this that I was unaware of for example there have been complaints that workplace conditions that Amazon especially those vast warehouses that provide you whatever you want and twenty four forty eight hours\nOr the workplace conditions are said to be pressure there's lots of pressure to perform not enough break time or the so go the anecdotes these are all anecdotal there's also a anecdote that at whole foods which Amazon now loans\nThere is a some pressure not to unionize because the word is out that the food workers want to unionize there's also the story that a Bernie Sanders the prominent senator who will likely be a presidential candidate again and twenty twenty\nUh brought something called the stop Bezos act which was making to do with the fact that Bezos is the is the richest man in this part of the solar system there are other richer men I understand that\nBut at the same time the wages that have been stagnating for his workers in the warehouse do you account for all of those complaints and uh the anecdotes as putting pressure on Bezos is Fifteen dollars in addition to what you're saying is this Fifteen dollars buying some peace for a while\nI think that's exactly what it's doing it's it's an olive branch or at least a\nA token to try to buy some social goodwill because at the end of the day Amazon probably fears government regulation\nMore than anything else a a show that it can out compete in out innovate\nMost other businesses and in other industries are scared to death at Amazon might try to jump into their space and start competing with them so it makes sense the Amazon just ... is trying to\nA win over regulators before uh other industries can use regulators against a as a weapon against Amazon themselves\nAnd then there's the other story of workers shortage we're ... we're out of workers in the United states goes the story that's why we couldn't get our ... lawns mode and a good luck finding somebody to clear your driveway if we have to have you know in the northeast this year\nAmazon says that it wants to hire a hundred thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand I mean some big number some big number for the holidays because of the demand so this Fifteen dollars that buying the workers that going to be enough ah workers are demanding higher and higher wages are they are demanding minimum wage wages\n[noise] I think that uh the Fifteen dollars an hour is a response to market conditions and I think this is one of those interesting situations where\nSometimes uh some people perhaps like a Senator Sanders might argue that the market doesn't create the outcomes that they want would want it to create but this is a perfect example of the competition for workers heating up to the point where\nNow workers have the bargaining power and\nWalmart and target and a Wal Mart are all in a an Amazon are all in\nA massive competition for workers uh they've been raising wages consistently for the last few years and a Walmart is even going to the point of offering to pay college tuition for its workers if they get a business or logistics degrees that would allow them to move up or in the company\nThe old theory from the Federal Reserve and I don't subscribe to this I just read about it Michael\nIs that wages are fifty percent of inflation and that one's wages start to move you're in a cycle you are behind or something like you can't catch up is this evidence of wages moving too quickly are are we looking at do we have the Goldilocks economy right now I'm not too hot not too cold\n[noise] it's hard to say and the number one rule of a economic school is a don't try to forecast what's coming down the line and number two rule is don't try to forecast what's coming down the line\nBut I Would say from all indications we are kind of in a Goldilocks age I don't know how long it's going to last but a wages aren't are falling behind inflation they're slowly are outpacing inflation even if it's slow\nAnd a workers are ah spoiled for job opportunities right now so it's hard to imagine things being much better\nAnd finally you mentioned Wal Mart several times Walmart does a great big fancy operation did Wal Mart's missed the boat when it didn't create Amazon what's your opinion Michael they ... they had everything at one point Nineteen Ninety five and then along comes Bezos do they do they do they worry at night that they missed it\nI'm I'm certain they do because they're already trying to hustle to catch up in the Internet space but I look at this story as a general uh example of how good market economies are because they are uh\nBusinesses have to be flexible and responsive to consumer demands\nA Twenty years ago you and I might not have been able to say that ah the Internet and Amazon was going to be as big as it was right but uh but we have that now and now Amazon or Walmart is trying to catch up to Amazon with its own online sales\nAnd in fact I just bought something at Walmart dot com the other day because the price was better there than on Amazon\nSo I think that it's a good thing to have Amazon and Walmart and everyone else competing against each other because it means they work that much harder to satisfy you and me\nMichael

he was making boats the SEC closed in because of his remarks about raising private capital for Tesla overseas\nBut really it's a demonstration that mosques ... these last years has reached the limit

say that that means that he's really not going to be his influence ... not going to be reduced very much which is what are the stock of that company really wants the stock holders they want him there whether it reduces his activity a little bit of Tesla to give a little bit of arrest because I think his biggest problem is just simply\nA overworking himself he need he'll he can bring yourself how

before but never not they're not making remarks about public public a public company saying I can go raised private capital in the heck with the stock price\nAnd it's costing money there's no doubt about it but I at any time the government steps in here I just my instinctual reaction is that uh I don't trust them\nOr I don't like you said to me that Wall Street hates mosque that indicates to me

columnist and editor at the wall Street Journal member the editorial board\nRotting most recently of Columbia this is a long and tragic story of a nation that has been ripped apart by narco terrorism gangsters for many decades and the resolution is not at hand if I follow marriage reporting carefully marry a very good evening to\nThe theory was the Nobel Prize winning former President Santos Juan Manuel Santos\nHad resolved the drug wars in Colombia and throughout the new world with\nA peace deal hammered out in Havana under the age of the Castro regime\nAnd that that would lead to consequences that could return the alleged gangsters back to Colombian civic society and of quell the threat overhanging Columbia these many years but it's a nation turn in half by cocaine your\nColumn points to disruption and this\nBecause the former gangsters the FARC the revolutionary group\nOr not complying or have completely violated their promises and it appears that the new president in Colombia is incapable of enforcing the document in some fashion a very good evening to marry is this a tragedy now or is this a tragedy to being averted in Columbia\nWell good evening John I think the main problem with this so called peace agreement is that the people who were supporting it um ah\nBasically bought into the idea that the FARC\nOr this revolution at these revolutionary guerrillas were purely a political group\nAnd they ignored the fact that in the Nineteen eighties they began drug trafficking extortion operations kidnapping operations and importantly in Columbia illegal mining operations these are businesses where they made millions of dollars\nAnd so from the eighties until today they kind of converted themselves from this political organization into a organized crime I if you and it\nAnd I'm so Santos go brings them all to Havana and has this so called a\nPeace agreement that he does with him he doesn't extract any concessions from them\nHe doesn't make them hand over the money that they made they say we don't have any money he says okay that's fine then\nHe doesn't make them do any jail time he says okay you can go off to these little farms in rural areas where he'll be confined for some period of time where are you will then you know confessed year crimes to I'm\nA to a special a peace court\nAnd then you can be reintegrate into society ignoring the fact that these guys are basically mobsters\nAnd I'm a ... which is not to say that I don't think they some of them still have a political agenda but their political agenda is tied to expanding their businesses okay so this idea that they were going to get out of the businesses and they were going to do regular jobs\nUm I think was never really believable I thought it was laughable and you know you know that over the years I wrote very strongly against\nMaking these concessions to these guys who have a whole a history of atrocities and human rights violations against the civilian population of the country so here we are you know I'm not quite two years I mean I'll be two years in November that they've signed these peace agreement and what do we find we find\nThousands of members who were FARC guerillas who are supposed to go these are the rank and file guys they were supposed to go to these rural enclave hand themselves and spend time there confess their crimes et cetera they're returning to the battlefield they're returning to the battlefield because they're fighting against\nOther armies illegal armies that have ...\nBeen to the space where they were and taken over the cocaine business\nAnd they're sitting there going wait a minute we're going to sit in these camps were going to get real jobs that pay minimum wage and these guys are still going to be making the money no way so they have gone back to the battlefield that's one problem is the second problem which in my mind is even worse is the fact that the head honcho Z\nWho were sitting in the event of negotiating the deal\nI'm had been found are alleged to be still in the cocaine business and I can talk a little bit more about that but the point is they don't want to get out of the business so it's not that the current president\nYou know doesn't want to enforce the deal but in order to enforce the deal or to go to to complete the deal to implement the deal he needs the FARC which signed off on it to do what it said it would do and guess what what has surprised you know these criminals are not keeping their word\nThe complaint right now you report is from the Colombia's attorney general president attorney general Nestor Umberto marching marching knows that the FARC has not complying with the peace agreement in ... and worse in the special\nPiece court they are making a ... they are making a farce of their ... their ... mostly testifying and couldn't concocting documents\nNo uh Martinez has the power of the state of the new president I've been to K. R. can exercise power in some fashion is limited in in some important ways politically compromise or to in order to prosecute these complaints by his own attorney general\nWell no I think the attorney general could prosecute them but I think what becomes clear when you when you read about that allegation is the same\nOld tired of the whole problem with trying to police this this drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "New York", "day": "03"}
