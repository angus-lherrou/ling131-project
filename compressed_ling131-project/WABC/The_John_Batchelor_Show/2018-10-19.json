wedding you're on the market then show Ben Ferguson filling in and I go ahead\nMan thanks for having me on a a a really enjoy your show hey thank you had a good question I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but\nNot from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama filed federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws\nThey successfully argued that\nImmigration was the sole per per view of the federal government\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument well no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce the immigration was some of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise]\nA sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's whenever they don't ... people need to understand about liberals they don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most\nThat's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean that there can millions you liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ... no one will ever criticize you\nFor doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day during the complete opposite the next day ...\n... is the part where I'm confused as is it is with the court to sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to the system stuff like this yet those think courts are\nStepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand [noise]\nYou got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have\nGo all in on it wrecked because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump they need new voters in here and they need to give out in the end they need to do a quick ... and ... are you at the end of the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with his bed to raise\nIf all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done well absolutely absolutely\n... and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never gonna win California well if you can turn Texas\nTo them for the Dems those three states\n... it's virtually impossible to do math that makes it were a Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California the same exact way by the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentator she was just on MSNBC\nDeadline White House\nAnd she had some very insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberals of the day with some great advice that analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nHe's doing that the scare having journalist care who he calls that any of the people as we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was thinking

Central American governments would encourage one of our left is suggesting that\nIf there's a melodrama psycho drama like there was in July where families can be separated under the guise of being asylum seekers and refugees rather than just people that most people come the United states wanting a better life\nThan that would hurt Donald Trump in the mid term in fact people up and down is remember about three or four points in July of two calls may team and so that's the I think that the timing and then a contrary if\nThey feel that the Republicans might keep the house there might be a border wall authorized and actually bill and so this would be the last time you can get across I think the mid term is loom large as far as the timing of\nHow to regard this from the part of the part of since the bass first of all the base Republicans responded very well and twenty sixteen to the talk of build the wall is that still the case your measure Victor\nYeah I think it's a it's a much more a winning issue even now than it was then because we've gone through all of these either ration the psycho drama that cold butter melodrama from I think people are starting to see that the news cycle is for people here illegally that are committing crimes that are impacting\nNegatively communities ... California about forty percent of so called Latinos Hispanics expressed the desire to close the border\nAnd the Democrats are there was a great deal of attention to the separation of families over those last month that ... that issue seemed to have been park to the side they went to a more exciting headlines like Kavanaugh\nJust this issue of the ... of the caravan they call a caravan it looks like a a march toward the border does is engage the Democratic base\nI think that the effort but I'm not I'm not sure it is for the priests cynical drawn I remember it's only based on the idea there's twenty or so million illegal aliens or when there was three or four number that Chuck Schumer the Clintons Cesar Chavez\nEven were for border enforcement because they felt that\nOpen borders negatively impacted a minority communities where they're at competed for social services eroded the wages of union and the level workers but only when they flipped California and New Mexico Colorado Nevada do they feel that open borders were advantageous\nBut it's kind of predict it it's kind of emblematic of the current Progressive Party that the laws just\nA useful if not ... the in the

the caravan from charging illegally across the border\nThere are those who have need for sanctuary and they can apply there are those who have papers many are boasting they don't what's so hard about

sixteen we have a new president on blow in Mexico who has been a ... who has been cooperative with the Trump Administration in terms of trade does\nThat suggest that there's going to be a change of

they have a ... economic remember they run a Seventy one billion dollar trade surplus with us when they get thirty billion dollars and remittances mostly from illegal aliens are subsidized by American social programs but I don't think they want to jeopardize that may feel for the first time that Trump's that type of\nUnpredictable president but might in fact jeopardize that relationship so I think

[noise] [noise]\n... um\nI'm John that sort of this is the John ... show a welcome my colleague leader Lisa dumped her she is the foreign desk and she reports too many routinely on Iran and the matters of Iraq this is about Iran but it's not about Iran in ...\nIt's about Iran in the in the university environment today and the discussion about Iran and the university environment today I've told similar stories about China but this is the first one I have\nThat Iran is the centerpiece leads to a very good even if you you are\nA very happy graduate of Rutgers University and most recently within these last days you were scheduled to give it to give a presentation on campus about Iran in the world uh what was the presentation and why did it not happen good evening to Lisa\nCould eat a lot of this was a very unfortunate situation by Mao alma mater with by the by the university itself often when you hear\nA ... protested or shut down a are cancelled by the school this is usually an invitation fringe organization or you know the calculus or ... or\nA group that pro Israel a trip down but pro\nPalestinian group but this was an invitation from the University of south and I was given the subject of a by the University of south to speak about radicalism on college campuses\nI extended that uh talk to freedom of speech on college campuses that would give a very comprehensive talk about the environment of the college campus today a in light of protests in light of empty hashtags in light of those are good et cetera\nLast week the vice chancellor of the school called me I guess with a former professor of mine that I just want to like you know that's a counter protest Shaq was started again you coming to the school and speaking and encouraging that you are and it's the lumber felt\nA now you're on your ... very well and those who follow my work very well that was that the bulk of the work that I Do it in the bending of Muslim the Muslim world against\nTerrorism against human rights abuses against yes again sex slavery against I said a and\nSomething that I've always defended again a with a a very ugly and to ... a movement now I should I was started by one a student and the student is the head of the a\nProgressive students a group and I worked on Bernie Sanders' campaign is also a Muslim students part of the bus lifted organization a\nDeliberately misquoted me a in a speech that heritage\nFoundation of two thousand Fifteen equipped to I said ah the ah you know Islamic terror a claim to take it friendship but the Koran and he claims that he he quoted as saying Islamic Kurt ... and the Koran and for that do that I Am\nIn fact and Islamophobia\nThe school did not look into the allegations they said that they have to be sensitive\nAh students and shut down\nThe speech and cancelled my talk now it'd be a statement that school released to the press they said that he talk with him back postpone but when he spoke to me they said that it was cancelled but they don't expect me to accept another indication from the school\nUh but the the last few days this has gotten so much media put out a statement saying\nThat they are in fact in fighting back to school or if you do is talk and you know and and offered me for different they\nAre claiming that the school that believe in fact is freedom of speech when in fact obviously it appears that they shut down for you to pitch in my talk so obviously John\nA very uh uh I Would say\nHow ugly pain for a week that I've had because this was in my alma mater the I only have a ... that this where they talk about I was going to give out the freedom of speech\nA and really having to school not believe in having my reputation and good name uh in in this arena or where I have again always always differentiated between the Muslim people are and the hijacking of Islamic political Islam\nRadical Islam at least at least\nAt this sounds like you're you're helping Rutgers learn something about a game that's going on and it and it's going on in many campuses and it was directed at you it really doesn't matter how the weapon is what the weapon is\nThat people claim a grievance and the university or the college campus immediately runs away it's very strange I hear the story again repeatedly is all the different subjects but the same matter right at the university didn't look into the person who written the complain they didn't know they call him on the home where did they\nThey didn't you anyhow my well they they met with the students yeah or the vice chancellor told me on the phone that to be honest with you I didn't understand his grievances against you but I have to be sensitive to them because they sound like they're very much injured by you\nAre and they don't bite you can't pick\nUp again these are words and your social justice bugged work where they get people to sign a petition\nThe word Islamic right because of the word racist because of the word bigot because of the word Hubble\nRight if it's a it's a bit down the list it's a\nTemplate where the attacker has the advantage and you were attacked and you have no there is no easy defense and because of the university went along with it now is the university wiser have you heard in any will fashion from the deans of the professors you were speaking with that they've learned a lesson here\nYou know it didn't seem like they learned a lesson in ... they learn a lesson in so far as to defend their their me her PR purposes because\nThankfully the silver lining if people like yourself John gave me a platform or or reported on this story and we we want and that is a silver lining\nThat initially I was very much frustrated because I thought you know one because they launched a very a fatal attack again right without any proof\nBut like what have you heard about have you heard from the University in anything like an apology\nWell the apology was that that email that they sent it in the form of a second statement saying that uh we're sorry you should\nUh that's not an apology Lisa and I know and I think that's the old I'm Sorry if you were offended that's not an apology Zach it felt like it exactly right it's soccer though\nWhen does this mean when when when ... when they invited you when can you go on campus because everybody's going to want to hear you know\nEveryone wants to get me talk but to be honest uh John I haven't I haven't made the announcement yesterday to make it of course\nI'm alright alright fight it sooner rather than later right Lisa\nWell I think I'm going to do the speech on I'm On social media that I have a broader audience short I click\nYes and I can stay safe because I have received threats when I wanted to go to camp is a and you know I I I Know I feel betrayed by that alma mater so it's very difficult to stay right as\nI understand that don't understand entirely Rutgers University Rutgers University um apology it's very simple you say we apologize that's how it goes simple to send two wars and so we used to ... she is the foreign desk I'm John bachelor\n[noise] Mm\nHistory diet dot coms John\n\nWe're I'm Barbara ... stories will be talking

allowing a movie theater for the first time to open in his country a and also you know making overtures in ways that we haven't seen before I couldn't imagine before when\nIt comes to Israel um all of those are two the or to the good and there he and the Saudi Arabia is it how why they're very important ally against Iran and a regional war right now the Cold War I'm at the same time those decisions that I just mentioned the jets\nOf an erratic paranoid delusional leader for some if if if it is as bad as we now suspect\nWhat could possibly be going through his mind that you could send Fifteen people to Istanbul lure someone into your consulate and not have this be a massive international incident\nJust from a practical perspective let alone the heinous nature of this crime let alone the moral dimensions of it so uh\nI I'm very worried about the U.S Saudi relationship even if we get past this crisis because of the head of Saudi Arabia right now if somebody who I think if unhinged ... ... one\n... are really the options for the U.S to react to this we're going to impose the sanctions on Iran we're going to need the kingdom support as an ally and how uh how does the United states maintained the alliance and meet its own national interest and yet they react properly to what happened\nWell I I mean this is a great test right now for secretary of state Mike Pompeo or because you need to balance a few things you do not want to get into a situation where\nAre you you know establishing that Mohammed\nBin Salman is a an erotic figure that uh he overreact and does something you've been more self defeating\nOn the other hand the Saudis need the United states just as much or more I'd say more than the United states in Saudi Arabia and um they are still going to have an imperative an extra sexual imperative to fight\nThe Iranians are regardless of the relationship the United states so that's my first point on that and the second thing is I think the United states and I'm not just talking about human rights are an important American value or that we should have credibility when we criticize Russia or China\nThat's all true but that that's less compelling to me there is a very real cost that we need to impose on the Saudis if only to protect its draw a line to make sure that\nAny other dictator who is America's ally will\nThe message that you better not go after\nYou know permanent residents in the United states in third countries that other journalists I mean that's a I think a very important thing that I just important norm that we would like to uphold at this point that the Saudis have violated and so they have to pay a price that said I Am not in the camp that says we should reevaluate the relationship I I don't I don't think that's in\nAmerica's interest by any stretch 'em so there are some options and those options I think of revolve around a couple of points wanted something known as the global Magnitsky Act which\nAllows the United states to impose

but just not having the United states\nYou know come up you know whoa side on whatever story the Saudis are going to give up about their minister of intelligence and it was ... and you know the crown prince of know about it if we believe that is not true\nThen the United states did not feel that they have an obligation to go along with that and that's an important point as well and then I Would I Would ask the state department to\nInvestigate the disappearing journalists I Would um you know I Would I Would I Would think about you know not necessarily a wholesale suspension of arms sales but something where you know they got the methods that certain systems they might want that aren't exactly necessary\nBut I think they have to be that there has to be an understanding that they pay a very heavy price at this point\nEven if I think it's unrealistic to the United states can affect a you know some sort of changing leadership at this point because my comment bin Salman has eliminated all

response was immediate and yet the response is not adequate Malcolm because\nTheir other aggressions or the tunnels where are they\nThe tunnels are very serious matter and you're quite right the

involved Iran and route car and Bob uh the war with Israel so many things in this ah onion that you can take layer after layer\nBut the the Israel or the IDF attacked for twenty targets military target somewhere rocket installations others\nBut one of the most important was the tunnels and these are tunnels for terror they're very sophisticated these are not just the saint castle operations they have they involve the costs of perhaps millions of dollars they ... they are electrified day of like the air conditioning\nAnd they are developing the Palestinians to terrorists at developing new means new technologies new\nMaterials that can deflect attention Israel has technology they use a combination of ah the sensors territorial censors 'em and they use intelligence and\nTechnological sensors\nTo uh to gather information they destroyed sixteen tunnels this year including the one recently which was a huge one\nBut the estimates are that there are perhaps thirty attacked tunnels and several dozen more that are defensive and by defensive I mean that they're used to hide arms died soldiers you know underground so that they can go to the surprise attack with it is or when they come under fire they can hide their ah we've seen that these\nIf they're getting more sophisticated in the rockets and mortars that are are um are are being fired\nAnd be a so Israel has to develop new methods all the time to detect the tunnels because they're only purpose is for ... they want to kidnap they want to murder\nAnd the ah you know they have the fence now that's going a little Israel's borders so it helps protect somewhat though not the\nUh completely so the the tunnels remain a really serious a danger and that's why the idea of hit them and try to hit other infrastructure without causing civilian casualties and nobody notes this but there are no reports about civilian casualties\nKnock on the who claimed credit for the rocket attack\nNo one and it's interesting how ... both said wasn't us we're investigating wasn't us and um that seems to be quite common in the middle east today but the fact is that\nIt has to be you can't fire from Gaza without them knowing especially you know a a large rocket\nAh being able to track exactly where where it's coming from and who was behind it and the you know the Hamas is in charge and if uh you know when you were in charge you're responsible even the EU issued a statement that said that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations that are not acceptable\nI Wonder if discriminate attacks are but they said you know that rockets and he has to stop but they will take no action they don't do anything to implement it in the meantime you have the escalation because it's diversion from the internal problems\nYou know the PA barred the oil from going in now Israel has closed obviously the crossings and stuff because they placed bombs on them are on the Israel's border are no Israeli soldiers so it's not
