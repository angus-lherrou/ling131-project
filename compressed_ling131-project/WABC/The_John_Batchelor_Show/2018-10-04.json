into the Silk Road with its drill will see\nNow there is a Silk Road project everywhere belt and road is the overall umbrella but at the same time China has been advancing money sometimes called credit to Eurasia and we're going out to our colleague our feet 'cause his ear\nConsulting because he has published a paper very helpful in the south China Morning post\nThat identifies how China has pushed its credit into Pakistan to build gigantic projects with cash with credit that at this point Pakistan can hope to repay and how Pakistan is seeking to defend itself from belt and road\nEris it's wonderful to speak again I have heard this called a call this conduct by China Neal colonialism\nIs Pakistan rejecting this because it feels to pinch of being under the Chinese book what is what

thousand and a Thirteen and it really took\nSteam and two thousand Fifteen and socially it includes um a series of infrastructure projects that are maybe worth upwards of sixty two billion dollars but right now what we're seeing is around twenty to thirty billion dollars in play a these are electric power projects and rode a mainly road infrastructure projects\nThat are across the country and the

of the in the past the past five years\nUh and so it's a what it's done is it's um you know strengthen\nThe structural ... ah or an imbalance and Fox on the economy uh the uh the trade deficit and it's leading to current account deficit it's why didn't the current account deficit and and ... could very well or face a bouncer payments crisis\nSo a seat back has contributed to this but I think it's\nA you know largely a byproduct of poor decision making in ... by the previous government and they just got easy money I easy financing easy cash off from the Chinese from the Chinese government\nAnd um you know they decided to push forward a lot of projects that did not have a strong economic rationale before um and the summers elections so because of political motivations and easy financing from the Chinese\nUh they they succumb to that temptation and now we're seeing you know the ... could very well have to go back to the IMF for for the twenty second time in its history\nWe've seen this pattern so many times before where centrally China is now financing projects that the private sector in the past just wouldn't touch\nSo China's got exposure in Venezuela is got exposure and true longer\nAnd of course now Pakistan and it would seem at some point China just would not have the financial wherewithal to bail all these countries out the United states is actually going to the IMF and exhibited a note of caution\nI'm trying to prevent the IMF from bailing out these countries\nBecause Washington thinks that this is essentially a bailout of China not an appropriate use of IMF funds where do you see this going in terms of the ultimate economic relationship between China in Pakistan will the Pakistanis to fall and if they do what is ... gonna do\nYeah you know I don't make a default is something that could happen in the near term\nUm you know most of these projects are uh you know essentially private sector projects but you know that for a state owned enterprises in Pakistan but the box any state or sorry Chinese state owned enterprises but the Buckeye State doesn't have direct liability for them it does have indirect liability at the\n...
