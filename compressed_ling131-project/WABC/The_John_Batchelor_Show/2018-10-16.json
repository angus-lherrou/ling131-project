steady and at the ready to watches that this office was open the top on the first thing they did John was they unfurled a big banner that read Islamic emirate of Afghanistan and that was a big problem in the eye of the Afghan government and us\nSaying no we consider ourselves to be the only true representatives Afghanistan that Afghan government is illegitimate and they have never come off that message wants and so what's what's striking about all this is that the U.S says\nPublicly any way that our goal for the talks as you get the tall blond to reconcile with the current Afghan government well how can they do that when they very consistently through the years have said\nThe current Afghan government as illegitimate it's a puppet of the Americans and we're the really the real old only real game in town\nThe memory and Vietnam crowds in here forgive me Tom I'm older and so this is the boomer fiasco to review a there are analogies there are mismatched as as well one that comes to me immediately\nIs that the Taliban leadership will not negotiate or derives Ashraf Ghani the president of Afghanistan\nAnd these dialogue looks as if ... is not represented in any fashion the Taliban wants to negotiate directly with the Americans that's a great victory for the Taliban at the beginning\nWell you're exactly right John and that's the whole that's the whole point here is that they they're using these negotiations directly with the U.S\nTo try and drive a wedge between us and the Afghan government and this was this cause a lot of embarrassment an added to the tensions with the atomic cars like when he was president\nSeveral years ago when the bomb mission try this because there were so many problems that arose out of that so it was embarrassing for cars I his government now of course Karzai's puts his character there are all sorts of problems there but this was you know he's still nominally our ally and to basically engage in these direct talks with tall blond\nIn a manner that sort of offensive to his legitimacy of sovereignty is very problematic and there is a sort of a with this time around that same thing which is sort of which again is a problem\nNow again the the the this junk here is the U.S is saying that the towel bunnies that come to the table\nReconcile in some fashion with the current Afghan government the ... says the Afghan government is illegitimate we're not going to do that well what's the point of the talks if the central go all the talk from the American side is something the Taliban is saying is just not doable and that's really the central question here as we move forward\nA wise man much taught me that everything has a price do we know what the Taliban's prices in dollars and cents are they looking at a large transfer of cash\nSome fashion the way the north Vietnamese and the Viet Cong finally negotiated\nYou know I I Want to be very careful I have to speculate here because we really don't know what their prices and all this and again you know their prices going is influenced by the fact that they smell a desperate negotiator on the other side of the table so they realize that we're desperate to get out and they're looking to extract more concessions just as they get in the past they use these past negotiations\nTo extract all sorts of concessions from the American side without really giving anything up in return\nI think you know there there are some different ways of this ... several there really is this could play out it could be the case of dog was not willing to give us much of anything um or could be that they're willing to grant\nIs sort of some sort of withdraw timetable\nFor Afghanistan and the price of that could be for example that several provinces that are are firmly under the Taliban sway now I'm basically are untouched as the U.S withdraws basically giving them\nA de facto safe haven as the U.S leaves and therefore they can use that of course what's we're out of there to basically start consuming and taking over more Afghanistan once again it may be that sort of that sort of arrangement\nUm it was a big things keep an eye on your to John is at the U.S has begged the top on for years to renounce al ... and of course they won't do it they haven't done it yet\nAnyway and then all these years the Taliban has refused issue even just a generic statement were announcing all ... and there's there are a lot of reasons for that one of which is that there's plenty of evidence that all kinds of the top on her main closely allied to this day and that's deeply problematic here because remember all kinds of the organization is still alive it's you know it's lost assigned a bond is lost a lot of its top leaders\nBut they're still very much into a ... organization\nIn Afghanistan Pakistan it's fighting and they definitely have one eye on us\nYes in the close of your piece and you have limited amount to ... a time I understand that but you suggest that a Taliban aggrandize by direct negotiations with the U.S let's hypothetical\nAh taking the U.S promises in some fashion becomes the the nucleus of a of an average that ... you can use throughout the throughout Asia spreading into the subcontinent riding damage\nOn you know ... to argue that the Islamic emirate Afghanistan the Taliban ... is the nucleus of a new caliphate I still remember this has been totally misunderstood\nAre a lot of people even in the ... field who have said well kind of doesn't really want to seize territory build a cow that nonsense you can go through their literature through the years they're very clear that that's the ultimate goal and what ... saying is that the Islamic ever Afghanistan is the nucleus or the crown jewel of this new imagine\n... signed on to that that is that he's identified says\nThat his argument that they'll ... argument that was Osama bin Laden's argument and so this is something that could easily have ramifications far outside Afghanistan\nAnd does the American side ... odd or the Trump Administration acknowledge that that is that suits a lottery to negotiate directly with his ... his agents\nWere only be blunt John I talked to a lot of American officials um I don't think it's widely recognized inside the U.S government at all with all kinds of positions on this and I think there's been a lot there's been a very large incentive to downplay or dismiss the al ... angle on all this why because it's very inconvenient to and sort of justifying this sort of\n... and wouldn't look to say the U.S retreats from that al ... yes no that that's not acceptable by your making the case here that's why he has been outspoken with his ambition and by refusing to negotiate with garlic ah with\nWith the ... of the president of Afghanistan that is what they're putting together they're putting together a ... endorsed by the United states of America\nYeah I mean there well the the crown jewel of the nucleus of that would be endorsed by the name ISIS America certainly because that's basically we're saying that the Taliban state is legitimate\nUm by granting granting this I mean you know when you look at a kind of Afghanistan today John we do our analysis based on multiple different sources\nPrimary sources of based on what kind of saying us raids Afghan rate you know who they go to target where these guys are where they're fighting remember the reporting of guys in the early this year job where you had all these foreign fighters there were mixed in with the Taliban that were there were part of this large scale solving

J. are the great voice of the great lakes joins man we're welcoming Gordon Chang the Daily Beast we're going to move\nThrough several anecdotes about the Chinese Communist party these days were puzzled by these antics least I Am\nBecause here to for over the last ten years Gordon I've been talking about the Chinese Communist party's diplomat they are black and they are peaceful rise say hang in the background in fact an anecdote from\nFrom the twentieth century when the KGB followed Chinese diplomats and mosque our Leningrad cause they routinely followed everybody back in the old Soviet days that was the best suited to have because the Chinese diplomats were so boring and predictable and never went anywhere did anything interesting\nAnd so everybody wanted the Chinese Communist party detail\nIf you're going to learn how to travel people around Moscow today I imagine it's very difficult to follow the garden a very good evening to you tantrum tantrum tantrum worthy of preschool\nFrom senior Chinese official last week we spend a deal of time talking about how ... the foreign minister had chastised Mike Pompeo in public on deservedly cell but the part was the part that was interesting\nWas that weighing a acted as in Iran a tab stamping Saudi throwing say and I've puzzled about it and you said well here he is\nThis is why this is so extraordinary they're frustrated but now I see other officials imitating weighing e or imitating some model what has happened in court and why are they acting this way these are diplomat good evening if you've gotten\nGood evening drawn to that is I think they're really two reasons\nFirst of all I think trying to really is frustrated a lot of things are not going it's way and so the Chinese are just not used to it so they are confounded by the situation\nUm second of all um and this is a background reason but it does explain the behavior of Chinese officials\nAnd that is that a few jumping just demands maximum position\nAnd so people have to demonstrate their loyalty and the demonstrating the loyalty\nIs to either going after Americans or jailing um weaker at an unprecedented pace or whatever to show that they are on board with these programs these programs are really likeable but I think a lot of Chinese officials understand that there are not in China's interest\nCertainly the Chinese people don't like many of these but it's what the demands and so while he is still in control they're going to do what he requires\nThat is a garden are there any problems within China itself but are exacerbating the tensions and the tantrums Communist Party officials\nWell I think that the the part of the problem is that when things don't go well I'm you know if you go back six seven months or so ago\nUm everything was going trying his way um and so I think Chinese officials just got a little bit flabby in a sense and that's understandable um because they had been bullying people and people had been actually doing what they want and that includes not only countries that are small but also large countries like the United states\nUm you know but Trump decided that he had enough of that and so he's pushed back and I I actually think that you know you're starting to see real problems in the economy\nAnd and that is really something that is concerning the Chinese um you have for instance drops in auto sales consumption all the rest of it that really nobody foresaw I'm just a few months ago\nGordon let's let's turn this a little bit and talk about the Chinese economy because you've written about it most recently the national interest\nOf the pocketbook issues drive our politicians when the economy is bad there is no place to hide although they try especially at election time I'm going to guess at the Chinese are exactly the same\nAs the United states except that they don't have election time they have one party all the time you publish that what we have here is a dimming Chinese J. D. P. going forward and strengthening American GDP\nThat's not supposed to happen now she has the long game does he have the short ... does he understand that this is a cycle and that he can take a recession and recover from it\nActually I don't think that they want a recession they don't believe that they can accept one so they're continuing to pour on debt and you know something which is really worrying ... China got a lot of praise over the last three or four years over climate\nAnd they made certain climate promises people put it on but we are now starting to see that there are increased use of coal I'm more missions more CFCs going into the air and that's largely because they're really pushing the factories to produce\nSo we're seeing I think um some very short term thinking because they just don't know if they can get to the other side of this you know Trump is confounded American politicians well of course he's confounding the Chinese they don't know what to do they don't know how long the quote unquote trade wars going to last and\nSo they're pulling out all the stops and it looks like a little bit of panic on the part of senior Chinese technocrats that is\nPart of the problem of Communist Party has said that liberty is the enemy of prosperity and security and so in any kind of recession or any kind of economic downturn they're going to do everything they can include including their own their own country to try to avoid that aren't they\nYeah well they certainly are and and the bigger backdrop which we've talked about before is that the June ... uh in his term eternal secretary so we're now talking about six years has really started to turn his back on\nOn the things that make China's economy pop you know it it's reform and opening up our are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down over there they're going back to state dominated markets and state determination of prices\nAnd they could of course become targets of us sanctions if they engage in any dealings with North Korea David a very good evening to you I'm very pleased to flags is that your direction\nThe USC is on trusting of commercials South Korea the U.S is suspicious that the blue house has given permission before it's negotiated with the U.S how to read this editorial damn good evening to\n[noise] uh reading but yes I think uh\nUh this this is clearly a you know a warning a and I think we're seeing two divergent or you know the last June prejudice or June of two thousand Seventy a President Trump and president moon agreed on ... ... pressure\nAnd engagement as the policy and we saw that extra few or for the last year but now that South Korea's had three ... inch of we're in the ... the middleman of nuclear the nuclear program\nOr South Korea or wants to engage in maximum engagement\nDavid just a moment I Want to check with Gordon on this uh Gordon the concern that you've had for some time about these summits the first one and now the proposed second one is that Seoul is is taking advantage of it or is weakening faster than the conversation permits\nIs so it's all being driven by another concern Gordon is Beijing behind this weakening of sanctions by a prospect of commercial enterprise\nWants the sanctions to be weekend because they've talked about this in public but what's really driving event feared John is not so much the Chinese but its moons right yeah\nI'm ... and Jay is number one goal matter of fact is number one to number one hundred coal is unification of the two Koreas states so he's doing everything possible to help Kim Jong on\nHe's very pro North Korea his advisors in there you were advocating the overthrow the south Korean state by North Korea so right now you got a political establishment and so that really is very pro Kim I'm very anti US\nDavid David the concern here is that there's something sinister is there or is this just so long frustrated trail of reuniting the Korean Peninsula how how to regard this from a great distance\nWell it's either it's either sinister or it's not even ... and I think that uh that Kim Jong ... I mean there\nWere Jay in wants peace at any cost and I think that that is really is driving a Porsche is that he wants peace and he wants to be the one to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula\nThe problem is he is making South Korea vulnerable uh in his idea of maximum engagement of course we'll go against the sanctions are in will actually could potentially strengthen North Korea uh in show whether he\nHe wants to unify with North Korea under North Korea's control which I don't think he does a I think he is has the misguided belief\nThat if he engages with with Kim Jong ... and he like President Trump believes that he can trust Kim Jong il and that's where I think they're both making the mistake 'cause I don't think Kim Jong Eun and be trusted\nA show he is embarking on maximum engagement and to go back to the earlier a editorial that you started with the United states has got to enforce sanctions and if South Korean banks are providing financial uh services to the north they may be violating sanctions the warning\nYes the editorial goes on guard and now I'm On them I emphasize this this is the editorial on October Fifteen from so these incidents clearly showed that the U.S now regard south in the south Korea as the weakest link among its allies international sanctions against North Korea is that justified Gordon\n\nIn some ways I think that it is John I mean one can argue about the Chinese or the Russians or whatever but you know Moon Jae in is definitely very pro North Korea and I hope Dave is right that he's just naive instead of malevolent\nUm but he's acting you know if he were malevolent um he'd be doing exactly what he's doing now so I don't think it really matters what his intentions are it's just that um what he's doing is under cutting the American efforts to um denuclearize North Korea [noise]\nWe've seen Moon Jae in actually become Kim Jong owns spokesman um that started in March and continue now uh every time we hear about something favorable about Kim Jong when it comes from Moon Jae in\nThis is extremely worrying John\nWhat about the Europeans David how are they getting ahead of this as well I note in this editorial it talks about France and it also mentions the IMF in the world bank\nBeing asked to play and play an active role so is is the U.S going to be in a position of the way it is they with Iran negotiating directly with our allies not to aid a sanctions a rogue states well\nI think this is yes we are becoming isolated because uh again that's Gordon said Moon Jae in is reaching out and he's made the statement that the international community really needs to reward North Korea recognizing it for the pledges that it's made\nAnd we should keep in mind North Korea has done nothing of substance or indicated sincerity to dismantle its nuclear program but again a Moon Jae in is reaching out and of course the French said that they would certainly assist in denuclearizing should North Korea do that\nAnd of course in addition to being the mouthpiece spokesmen for Kim Jong un a Moon Jae in is also becoming the messenger because he intends to deliver a letter\nThe pope inviting him to pee on your own garden you have a question for day\nSix months from now do we imposed sanctions on South Korean banks of the south Korean government on South Korean enterprises for violating sanctions\nWell I I certainly hope not because we must step back and remember that the you know that there is going to be no success on the Korean Peninsula oh without a strong rock us alliance and so we I think this was a warning to South Korea don't do this but we really have to\nUh to work on alliance man management\nUh and and rebuild a some of the bridges and some of the fisheries that are are are appearing in the alliance this was really important I and I think the United states as being proactive\nIn giving this warning so that we don't have to a section them because that would be a terrible blow to the alliance and of course means right into Kim Jong rules\nA desire to split the rock us alliance a divide and conquer divide the alliance to conquer the rock\nWhat's this look like David a best case scenario from a to Z to government could do governments one peninsula do they have a working working planned and mine are are they just smiling\nWell that's long been a proposed by many past leaders are certainly by the north uh I Believe that the north proposal to have a one country two systems is really a to support its support it's a barrage of the south and eventually dominate the south\nI think those in the south who believe that there can be a one country two governments are that can gradually unify I think that is the ... that exists there is no end of the nuclear program there is no end of the crimes against humanity as long as the Kim family regime is is there really needs to be a United Republican Korea\nThat secure stable economically vibrant non nuclear\nAnd organized under a constitutional liberal constitutional form of democracy determined by the south Korean people ate nodded Republic of Korea\nWe have less than ... go ahead garden\nSo so David what are the south Korean people think about what it's doing\nThirty second I think I have a ... I thought that\nThat uh the south Korea there many in the south Korean a population who are becoming disillusioned of course they're having internal economic problems in the lake and moon is focused on one\nClear objective piece at any cost and I think you're seeing a both young people and of course the disorganized conservatives\nAre that are in the south who have no real viable political power but they are a beginning to oppose this and they're seeing a gang action\nOr may not be interest of the of South Korea ... especially peace at any cost\nDavid Maxwell the foundation for the defense of democracy Gordon Chang of the Daily Beast I'm John bachelor\nThe Russians have hacked ... infrastructure and governance secrets to the United states has master hackers Tim\n...

him has reopened the debate of what credit she gave her the suppose a Native American heritage\nRemember that she specifically claimed that her parents had to be ... because of the problems are heritage caused in her father's racist family that regardless of what this DNA test shows we now know that that was one hundred percent faults\nIn other words she has once again opened up the fact that he's a liar and why she would do this I think David has the best explanation she can't help herself as for the congressional midterms\nYou know it's a model picture but I think as we get closer and closer to the election in key states like New Jersey even Minnesota Senate races are moving towards the Republicans house races are modeled but in the battleground districts were Democrats\nHave to do well um I don't think it's I don't think it's obviously have a clear lead I think we could be headed to a very close house contest\nWhere each side Britain may have an advantage\nOf only two or three seats down her up from a majority\nWhat's the generic from the latest poll John what's the spread\nAbout seven nationwide but the generic in the battleground districts according to some ... like the new ABC poll is only a one point democratic advantage remembered if you have lots of enthusiastic Democrats voting in the house seats\nWere there already are going to be safe Democrats elected that doesn't help you you have to wear the marginal those districts that Hillary Clinton carried with all through a lucky the Republican congressman\nSaturdays you have questions ... professional generally just out of curiosity what what's the reaction been from the Native American community about this they weighed in David\nYeah the Cherokee Nation a spokesman for the Cherokee Nation waste and basically\nA said that Elizabeth Warren a had done damage to the Cherokee Nation and to to the ... the concept of of Indian American Indian ancestry by\nUsing a DNA test you said that there's all sorts of ways in which ancestry determined\nThat it's it's up to them and and that basically she should have just kept her mouth shut John\nBy the way I'm the onion has just come out with this headline Elizabeth Warren disappointed after DNA tests chose zero traits of presidential power\nYes yes uh what where I did see the Cherokee Nation rising up there is a detail here that's important Elizabeth Warren in the past plane connection to a great American tragedy a great American cry that the trail of tears\nThese people were were robbed by by Andrew Jackson and the U.S Congress they were thrown into a migration that left them without good options in the unsettled part the frontier that we now call Oklahoma\nThis this fast was ... not only by the president of the United states Andrew Jackson and the Congress but also by John Marshall the very famous uh chief justice of the United states who at that point invented the idea or to go along with the trail of tears\nThat the Native Americans that they caught a so called Indians were wards of the state and they remain wards of the states so I Do not believe it was about the war and wanted to wander into that and have to explain herself\nBut she's borrowing from a tragedy that is ongoing gentleman I Want to turn to one another matter that came up in these last hours\nThat's Mrs Clinton making a strange remark\nAbout the relationship between the president of the United states and Internet the White House we whom we knew was Lewinsky David\nIs there any way that Hillary can get out of this or has she just completely disgraced herself to the now arouse Democratic Party of about exploitation and the and the office\nYeah look if you if you forgot why Hillary Clinton couldn't be Donald Trump who at at the time was equally despise uh she just reminded everybody I mean that there's just no way around this there's no way out of this and the best thing she could do is retire\nI to remind everyone who wasn't with us in the twentieth century uh to to to follow the partisan politics\nThe Democratic party rationalized Bill Clinton's abuse of Lewinsky by saying that she was an adult and these were adult decisions and it was none of our business because it didn't affect his presidency job\nOr has the Democratic party found a way to square the circle are they just going to as they just got a leftist spin out in the next cycle and certain Democrats will campaign against Bill Clinton is that how they're going to resolve this\nWell the culture warriors of the view program at ABC who died in the world liberal fanatics have decided to\nCurb Hillary over the side and say let's just not listen to her anymore uh I Wish it were so simple because Hillary Clinton as one hundred percent name identification whatever she says is news\nUm I think the Democrats are going to try to find some tape and just put it on her for the next Twenty one days in praise of the whole\nJohn Fund is in

bad actors for decades I saw that in two thousand and three we\nTurned out to the U.S Congress always better late than never turning against his blah with two pieces of legislation I Believe they're going to be signed into law Malcolm what legislation good evening to\nGood evening and I think that setting you just a offered is exactly right because these things have been long in the offing and many members of the house and Senate have tried to introduce these a legislative initiatives but to get the United states at AT T that honestly pass\nA bipartisan bill as you know is today quite miraculous and this one would sanction\n... when the next sanctions on a terrorist groups designated by the United states like Hamas has a lot and ISIS and al ... who use human shields in war meaning that they take civilians put them in front of them\nAnd use them as protection for those who want to fire over them as we're seeing in gossip a as we saw\nIt all the conflicts including using a ... institution schools hospitals the firing missiles from you witnessed a lot of this and we know that ... has a traded on this and taken advantage\nOf the fact that there was no consequences so this bill requires the presidents who identified oppose sanctions when each foreign person who's a member of are acting on behalf of because well Hamas\nAnd who knowingly orders controls or directs the civilians as to shield military objectives are from the attack it had fifty bipartisan cynical sponsors\nAnd I think reflects a real broad consensus that this barbaric practice has then and now we hope for the president will sign it\nThe second bill to what you looted is the illicit finance a bill which are targets 'cause the last ... supporters and it's called the ... national finance prevention amendments act\nAnd imposes sanctions on government entities that support the groups and military actions in sanctions competition vigils who ate as well as one race or recruitment\nOr it was passed by the house last month and now the Senate and both bills are awaiting the president's signature which hopefully will be forthcoming soon at these are uh you know find a focused measures but have great significance\nThat his nose Malcolm moving ahead what do you make of be released by turkey a pastor Brunson\n... thing with the timing couldn't have been better for them and the fact that he was held for two years is is forgotten ... release is discussed and especially now in the context of the\nOf the shows he um incident and we don't know yet the full story but the apparent murder um turkey seems to be the main beneficiary of all of this he's getting the Qatari defense minister visited the king of Saudi Arabia is calling him there he's making arrangements for\nWith others uh including the United states so he couldn't despite the fact that a while he condemns rightly the what happened a heat rest or the one that leader of turkey arrested a hundred thousand people including many journalists many military Joe jurors and others in in in every sector in fact\nI'm a but was never held to account for that but he is as I said I think the benefiting from this and the release of um\nOf the past it rains was certainly a in response to the pressure that the president brought to bear the threats of the sanctions Turkey's economy is weak as it is and I think they feared the consequences of a of additional sanctions\nI'll let me press you on this Malcolm timing timing timing but what I've learned\nReading history is when two things independently happen in approximately the same time zone\nMaybe there's a connection just ask ask cast Brunson released and ... disappearance\nBoth dependent upon the offices of turkey one for information about ... and after all it happened in Turkish territory and to the Brunson released although I Can't figure it out now I ... it's a puzzle shall I leave it a puzzle or their dots here to connect\nIt's too early to know about the ... and especially because of that go ... for instance released began before the ... incident that even was in anybody's mind as far as I Know so it's very hard to say unless you're you're saying that the at the Turks were responsible for it\nNo no I did not um you know what I'm saying the same time same people air to one out of out of favor and now suddenly in favor in\nFavor for yeah doing this [laughter]\nThe point is that he's being rewarded for an injustice that he is that they had imposed on pastor Brunson and the administration has made clear that the accusations against

Academy of arts and design is going to be built and it's right\nNear the offices at John ... of the city municipality the they found a hundred and twenty five skeletons more than two thousand\nThey are doing activation right Malcolm that's why they they ...\nFor any site in Jerusalem can be constructed on and before any road is Doug they they first and then the archaeologist because it's you know everything has some significance generally it's it's the vast majority of places\nSo they first have to get approval from the archaeology department and then they can then go ahead with

the French Revolution you observe the American revolution and he sought to explain it certainly there were extremes in the French Revolution that we're a bit disgusted the parliamentarians ends and made England fear so that they became\nResentful of anybody speaking what's it called leveling there were also\nA moments in the American revolution in the American civil war where the English Crown found it easy to preach to the people that ... these are radicals or not to be accepted\nIn any in any in any civilized place but Burke had an observation of what was the what was the driver\nFor the depravity in the French Revolution and what was the driver for the disorder and violence in the American revolution how did he explain it to his parliament as he addressed and Peter\nWell dressed and he addressed them and uh what started as a letter to a young man in Paris who could not understand why Edmund Burke the grey wig with defended all of that all of his care career had defended freedom explaining to the young man why he broke with not on\nThe side of the French revolutionary because the French revolutionaries Burke argued for the first time in human history\nThought I kind of revolution that was theoretical in dogmatic it and not only at changing who governed instead of the king that people let's say it aimed at changing opinions ideas religious faith\nCuts them and so on it's thought to be Burke called it a quote total revolution and this he said represented a new one per ... threat to three to freedom because freedom depended in significant measure on inherited customs inherited\nTraditions the Brits were at birth said men of a quote now on taught feeling I taught feeling\nIt didn't mean they were crude and vulgar he meant they didn't have to go to college in graduate school to learn how to live a life for freedom because their traditions taught them how to live a life suitable for free men\nAnd ... I I Want to translate this and other because birth didn't have the word he saw the French Revolution is a threat to freedom yeah as a threat as and we would use the word totalitarianism today yeah and he didn't have that word but he feared what he saw which was a transformation of the French\nOr tradition a transformation of in into something that was violent and dictatorial and he rejected it quite quite different from how we saw the American revolution how did he told the American revolution\nRight and I I I'd like to underscore your points on while he didn't have the word he clearly had the concept\nThe ... of a totalitarian isn't total revolution while the French revolutionary did not have the technology that would allow them\nTo monitor monitor people in their homes they certainly have the aspiration\nShared by totalitarian of the twentieth century even remake human nature and of course the American revolution fundamentally different the American revolution was we would say today and I think accurately and broke understood this very much\nCould call it a conservative revolution in what that\nThe American revolutionaries were not attempting to contain\nDog much change religious faith changed custom and tradition quite to the contrary they thought to preserve the way of life that they had to be brought over from England and the seventeenth century brick warned that the Seventeen Seventy five he said\nHe said who are he said the parliament those Americans actually they don't have a legal right\nTo be represented in debates about taxation imposed upon them\nBut you're never going to be able to convince them up that because they're too much confused with quote again that your love of liberty close quote which they get from the British But then having that are energized by being three thousand miles away\nSo the Americans were serving a way of life from what they regarded at the abuse of power by ah by the British king and in fact\nThe Americans introduced the constitution that was designed to keep government limited so actually fit and could continue to live the traditional way of life or we should say if they wish to break with tradition\nA matter of conscience they were also free to do so under the American constitution\nI Want to I Want to go over a detail here Burke was inheriting a tradition that his English yeah and the tradition was hard fought from the sixteenth century through the seventeenth century to the glorious revolution through Cromwell to the glorious revolution and I've recently been reading Peter there's a new book\nA young Benjamin Franklin in which the author Nick bunker takes us back to the sixteenth century England\nWhen the first of the lord start partition up the land and taking away arable land and grazing land from the from the young woman from the peasants and make them a wage slaves that they're imposing a kind of slavery on the people who resent it who revolt\nAnd that ... takes a hundred years but we come to John Locke\nAnd the early ... berry and the glorious revolution all that transformation that's a tradition that Bert takes for granted\nThat data he's inherited over a hundred years that's a tradition that our forebears came to America just speak for themselves and I've often had it ... I've had it wrong my whole life America didn't invent this tradition we inherited it from our English for bear\nI I think that John that formulation is a exactly right I don't know quibble with one small sprayed said a burp took it for granted in a way Burke took park it took it for granted until the\nFrench Revolution then he saw the tradition which he knew to be the source of his freedom with under with under profound rap and so that's how that give birth to what we now call modern conservatism when heritage or of the English tradition of freedom\nSees a rising a direct threat\nFrom also within the tradition the French Revolution to freedom and their began the great and recurring challenge for those of us devoted to freedom which is somehow reconcile the claims of individual liberty and tradition\nYes we we we will address that sometimes called writes abstract rights Burke worried about it here in the twenty first century ... pens just in much the same way when they partition the grazing land of the ... of Great Britain you feel squeezed on all sides Peter\nPeter ...

you're at it be the man who makes the suit and try our custom made offerings of tuxedos suits and Kashmir jackets from our black label collection\nSo me me at the corner of quality in style or if it's easier forty ninth and Madison Avenue I'll see you there [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show [noise] [noise]\n\nI'm John ... this is the John bachelor show there is a study from twenty Fifteen the power parity my McKinsey global Institute speaking to gender equality in the workforce I welcome Richard Epstein professor Richard Epstein at the Hoover Institution is senior fellow teaches law at NYU and the university\nOf Chicago because in twenty Seventeen Richard reporting\nThe number of CEOs of fortune five hundred companies declined from thirty two and twenty Seventeen to twenty four and twenty Eighteen are we going in the wrong direction does this mean that\nThe advances made by gender equality these last years has been reversed suddenly because then fill in the blank Trump or is there more to this about the workplace and gender\nRichard a very good evening to you certainly this that test taking about decline of CEOs\nA headline you do not find however anything of substance underneath to support it so we go immediately to California where they have a new law California law that insists upon balance or at least some numbers of women on the boards of companies in California\nYou're measure of this is that it is much about no facts in the workplace there have been facts in the class when women have been restrained by court orders that is not now the case do I read that correctly\nWell court orders is not the correct term by legislation but the term but essentially what happened\nIs in the history of the United states starting at the end of the civil war there were many formal disability on the ability of woman to\nHold certain kinds of position at the entrance to certain kinds of contract and those limitations we're pretty much removed as a formal matter before Nineteen hundred and then in the next Twenty years old the political restrictions on women suffer just were lives\nSo at that particular point as a matter of legal contemplation every woman in every man had the same degree of illegal capacity to enter into contracts to make wills to acquire\nBusiness ride well the earth is Illinois and Muller versus Oregon You're very as well you know\nBrad well ... is an extraordinary case there was a situation in the state of Illinois where they put a ban on women working the majority opinion said there have been recent cases about privileges and immunities which indicate that the kind of federal constitution does not give protection to women um who want to enter into these occupations\nUm and so therefore the cases out and this was probably an incorrect reading of the stature of the constitutional provisions but take it and then there was one judge who in concurrence basically announced that the national biological condition of women was such that it was perfectly appropriate to keep them in the home\nDomesticity became not only a virtue by the legal requirements\nTo which the obvious answer is if you open up the markets and more women want to go in and up currently there they will do so men want to go and they will do so it turns out\nOr if you actually look at the way these markets are organized today this free entry and exit but there is by no means and the density of men and women and all kinds of places and all kinds of firms in the law\nAnd the same thing is pretty much true in every other occupation\nAh within medicine within the law within science there always tend to be sub specialty is to have Wi Fi male and a heavily male and these numbers have been roughly constant for the last twenty or Thirty years so unless there's some major legal course they're not going to switch to Mahler against Oregon is an ironic case it was from a tooth\nNineteen oh eight and a man who wrote the brief\nUpholding the statute which had a minimum wage law for women only was none other than Louis Brandeis who was probably the most prominent lawyer and the United states at that time it was I thought a dreadful briefed that he wrote about he persuaded one of the conservative judges a man named brewer um to uh\nBasically to uphold that statute is that a strike it down\nIn that particular case all the women who were hired were fired and replaced with um Chinese workers so it wasn't as though it did them a lot of good and in the long run most women rightly in my view of come to the conclusion that sex linked um minimum wage laws are flatly unconstitutional of because of what it is that they do\nThis or what was a heroic advance in Nineteen oh eight turns out to be a constitutional\nOn par honorable offense today which indicates just how strange in a funeral all these issues are open up the markets certainly but does that mean parity in every position\nNo because the available pool was not based upon the number of people\nIn the United states by sex which is what Jerry Brown thinks about it's obviously going to be dependent upon the number of people are the kinds of qualifications and unique forgiving kinds of jobs\nAnd who knows what that is about the one thing that is quite certain and many advocates for women on boards agree with this point is that the last person who knows what to do about this is the state of California and it turns out that it's really complicated if you have\nA four people on board and they want to add a fifth of all of a sudden they have to have two women that means you've got to go to six\nBut once you're six you have to go three women so now you're at seven and it's very difficult to fill seats on boards and if you're going to try and fill hundreds of seats literally on major public corporations with a group of women and then you're going to face the other question can you have a sex only\nRule here and wound acknowledge that this was a constitutional difficulty but the wages that you're going to pay for the men and for the women are going to have to defer because the men essentially are not going to be in the same demand is the limit is it'd be a very strong demand for that query\nAnd can you buy sects used different wages so the companies may be completely box thin and most people say oh my God was aboard you put people on because of specific\nAreas of expertise and it may be that there are many many women with MBA's an advanced degrees\nBut the question is you know something about a particular form of solar energy development and if you don't you're not the kind of person that you need for that particular board and we do know that you know for example if you look in applicants and schools\nDo social work eighty five to eighty eight percent of the albums tend to be female you'd do label architecture it's over Ninety five percent male so the sex declaration begins very early on and it works its way up through the decision tree to boards of directors\nAh sometimes the Democrats don't learn from their own history is packing the court adding to more justices\nAh we do know that FDR believed in his reelection in Nineteen thirty six that he had the strength to disrupt the Supreme Court that had rejected many of its recommendations for the new deal\nIn the previous term that came to nothing there were no it increases in the Supreme Court but it did lead to a blow to the Democrats in the mid term of Nineteen thirty eight when packing the court be more successful today in your opinion richer\nWell I mean look the problem first of all the thirty six thing is the court did to some extent change its view and so people have a mixed reaction about the threat but here pack the court has the following very dangerous feature\nFirst of all it is the sign of an authoritarian\nGovernment which constantly wants to tell other people have to run their lives and secondly if you put this vote as an abstract proposal that some people could come along and say if we carry the Senate at this particular point in time we will lead to more justices and will to two more Republican stalwarts and I would regard this as catastrophic one of the things that\nThe um whole cabinet on ... did was to break down all the rules of comedy all the rules of custom there's nothing in the constitution which says one Supreme Court must have nine justices\nBut from the civil war on it's always been that way and everybody's respected that rule\nAny unilateral deviation from that rule by either party is an open invitation for disaster retaliation and so forth and it will blow the company\nUp as far as I'm concerned so I regard this is both dangerous and irresponsible but I'm constantly challenged by people to come to baseless is with me because this these people are so angry about the Kavanaugh issue\nThat they really are willing to blow up the machine in order to get even with what they regard\nLet it go unless go to number two the recommendation and I've heard Gerald ... who is if if the Democrats control the house of representatives slated to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee speaking impeaching justice Kavanaugh is that a practical thing well regarded\nAs a very dangerous suggestion\nIf you're talking about the situation in a nomination for the Supreme Court but the advice and consent function of the Senate the Democrats have a perfect right to vote against capital for any reason on and on and so you don't care about burden of proof indeed all the Democrats who are convinced that ms Blasey Ford was correct\nWere also adamantly opposed and before you go into an attachment it's a criminal trial and all of a sudden they really are due process rules\nAnd there are examinations and all sorts of other things and for somebody to sort of announced that you're going to do an impeachment situation means that they have to assume that they were right on that particular case and it seems to me that the reason in the end why the boat did not change is that\nThe corroborated clams on one side did not stand up after multiple FBI investigations and not only the denial by justice Cano a but by all of the corroborating evidence that was introduced on his side and so I regard this is a\nTerrible idea it will simply keep things worse and it will try to create a stain on the court I thought the best thing that happened or the other day is when he was sworn in\nAll eight other justices of the Supreme Court came to the ceremony if one of them had been absent it would have been a terrible signal about the legitimacy of this and I think in effect what happens is\nEverybody should accept the appointment justice cabinet oh I think made a serious mistake in the way and when she got so angry although I forgive him for that but I think going forward what we have to do is to get all of this and everybody has to behave as though it it never happened\nAnd that includes a justice cabinet he cannot sort of try to take this out on anybody knowing everything I Know about his character not personally but from other people I think he's up to that task\nConstitutional overhaul that can take many faces let's say that the president no longer has authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and it's passed up to Congress there are other recommendations as well or is it very unlikely we'd overhauled the constitution but it is to just it as a remedy two of the cabinet or unhappiness\nWhile the two things one it'd be an absolute me late to sort of assume that the Congress gets to pick somebody without a nomination the process of nomination with advice and consent for principle offices into high judges has been with us for many years\nIt's obviously a political process but things are worse the important constitutional change would I Am in favor of making is to make these appointments for a term of say Eighteen years or Fifteen Years right\nTerm limited next recommendation term limiting it\nI have defended that for many many years I think it's absolutely critical there is a factor in the United states all article three judges as they're called have lifetime terms so now when ... we create a specialized tribunal\nThere is an enormous resistance on the part of everybody to make them article three judges is much more efficient to put them in a bankruptcy court and so forth\nWhich has a fourteen or Fifteen your trip we should make that the constitutional norm I had a recent discussion with Jeff Rosen an Adam lift tack on that that Adam who's from the New York times and I disagree on many things but we were one on that particular propose\nAnd term limits ... ... ... is there a number that they talk about Richard that everybody Fifteen\nTo Eighteen years you don't want it to be a short his political appointments but you don't want it to be so long or the other restriction which I'm In favor of this getting people out at seven day and I'm saying this when I'm Seventy five so I'm now\nBarred for life but I Do think what\nYou want to do is to make sure that you don't get these generational shift in fact I Believe the same thing is true for the Senate and the house the limit town is always used to say three in the in the house at six years and two in the Senate I thought there was much too short when I'm In favor of something like ten in the house and for the Senate or twenty and twenty four years\nI think there's something deeply wrong with the process when the head of two committees based on seniority about eighty five years old trying to figure out the way in which the future should do I thought Grassley behave admirable I cannot say the same thing about Senator Feinstein and will not but\nIf you're thinking about this is a process you do not want people at that age taking dominant position is in the United states if they're still vigorous they can do all sorts of things in the private sector but incumbency is not a rapid or sensible road but figuring out the way in which we govern this country\nAnd finally the McConnell rule which Mitch McConnell is called the Biden ruled this is just suggest than in the final year of presidency the nomination wait for the people to vote before the new president or the continued president make the choice is that a recommendation that could be institutionalized\nAlready there this is something that you don't need to do by legislation\nUm let me go back and say what I thought about the McConnell decision back this respect the Merrick Garland point number one is gone was a perfectly qualified judge a judge of some genuine distinction and a great deal of affection by everybody who knew there was no issue about quality whatsoever and that\nPoints just should not have come up but on the other hand it was very clear notwithstanding the fact that it was sixty three notwithstanding the fact that it was more conservative than the other four liberals on every major vote he would've switch the ...\nThe other side and that includes campaign finance and includes guns that includes affirmative action the whole smear an abortion\nNow I think the Republicans should have said\nWe don't care about the next election we just don't want this guy and we think we want to keep this open and we lose the election then you get to a point to him and somebody else I think candor would have been much better but Democrats are perfectly candid their attitude\nWas it they had even a majority of fifty one forty nine there's no way they would have confirmed capital and the only grounds an objection that they would have made a what we don't want to switch it over and at that point they would have done something which thank God the Republicans did namely that would not have had hearings\nAt which point we would not have this terrible situation\nWhat happened this time around is that Republicans knew if they played it safe they're going to win fifty one forty nine fifty two forty eight with causes it was fifty five forty five not going to get that the second time around\nWith Democrats knew they play it safe it's fifty one forty nine and they lose so they have to blow up the entire thing which is why long before we actually got to the sexual scandals involved in this case the Democrats were ...\nPeople come into the courts that we're having points the borders that were grandstanding in one form or another and keeping secret information which they laid a load on the ball and I think the fact that is what I regard is is not a not acceptable\nIf they all of them announce that day number one we will not vote\nFor this right right right because we dislike him I'd say thank you it's an understatement at which point I Would do the following thing that's a good we don't have any need for Harry convince you don't want to we're convinced that we do want him why do we want the craze if you do out here and I have another recommendation\nJohnny ... go ahead probably never\nLet the candidate speak because oil do is you have people fight the trap and to make them appear insincere exhaust them in one thing or another the older practice was people could comment on his record which was a public matter but you don't want to get that personal element in there and an oil but extreme cases I Hope that that would be followed\nRichard after the end of the Hoover Institution I'm John ... the John ... [noise] and no\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in test it and I fear that people will buy some counterfeit\nSo it was on campus or in Chattanooga and he saw the son of the university president walk by and he said hey ah\nYour father gotten any kind of a increase warning to services looking for men or anything and he told them that uh they gotta increase for the marine corps\nLooking for some candidates to be junior officers and you're right Kate flipped him and said the marine corps what's that a buddy enlisted signed up uh went to uh the infamous Paris island which at that time with a brand new a training Center for\nIt didn't really exist the way you describe it it was an abandoned ... area not I'm not used since the civil war it\nWas like it was like I think it would have been used as a prison there were plantations there you know it's run out on the south Carolina coast hot better place\nA you spent some time there and he didn't really dwell on his time there there's other Marines right about all hellish it was an hellish the training was and how brutal everybody was you know the conception that we have of sometimes a marine training um [noise] he was then shipped to another brand new training area called Quantico\nAnd dividing men into companies' battalions and uh he was part of a second battalion with a Ninety six company and uh the first and third\nHad already going on so they were inventing the marine corps around him that this is the first time anybody had dealt with Paris island in the first time and time and the first time that they had a ... a well didn't even exist in the spring to court the time as we understand that\nThey just they were the same clothes that the army war they were uh they had they had inherited senior officers but those senior officers had been like I had been mostly navy man operating on ships in faraway places so there are cases there at the beginning is my understanding you\nYeah the marine corps basically I mean established I think in a Seventeen Seventy five but you know it's like if you see the movie mastering commander there is a marine delegation on that ship all that the British ship that's kind of model for the off a bit ship might have eight or ten Marines and they were there to fight they need to fight you\nMight have ten Marines with the gardening litigation you might have thirty guarding allegation and taking a spread all over the world fighting what they called the banana wars in Haiti protecting American corporate interests I'm In Central America\nWrites medley butler a famous said ventured and marine right just painfully of how the Marines fought to keep Mexico safe for American oil and Haiti in Cuba safe for national bank so they had an ironic sense of their duty\nBut especially for him because he went to a medal of honor as well ah with the Marines and then he had a change of heart\nLater on and just said you know yeah I protected or whatever it was a the the ... you do for a company you know just got that you became very cynical towards a view of the Marines so\nAnyway um they had a ... they had a very small force as well which was expanded as war will start to approach to about Eighteen thousand men and then they expanded beyond that to thirty one thousand men are still you compare\nBut now a number of American Vietnam the army's effort to raise an army of at least a million beginning what that's what they were thinking of\nAnd there was opposition in fact a when George Barnes a comment that the marine corps approached the army and a a F commander John Pershing offering as Marines service in France there was a lot of animosity towards him they told me to go talk to the navy they weren't interested and even having them um\nBut he was connected politically through his wife was able to uh\nUh ultimately sent to regiments which comprises the ports were gate of the second division to France um and among them was close gates\nRight let's go to France now they fail in January\nOf Nineteen Eighteen they arrive in France in February an and we begin with the manure sector\nOr they are not treated with respect by the French at this point who had overall command it's important to say the Persian resisted being I\n... a ... a plug in part by the French Army had T's really to have morale the previous year with the with the mutiny the British Army was very small and the allies were planning on using the Americans as replacements Marines to Jim\nOh yeah they just wanted to just basically even even singly take any American mitigating plugging where the lines you know as as cannon fodder\nAnd person to his credit always had a vision of a unified American Army um any help too that he held to another crisis of march Nineteen Eighteen the Germans launched a huge offensive are aiming to split the French and British forces in northern France\nAnd still pursuing held out and uh the field marshal um [noise] uh for non folk actually Saturday willing to lose everything the whole war just to keep your of your forces attacked me said basically yes but\nThen he reconsidered and he told folks in late march although we have as yours and so right then uh the first division went to the fond du da sector and famously assaulted the village of campaigning late may\nAnd distill the second division in the Marines or by the way she mentioned at the second division also we have the third brigade which is the ninth and twenty third regiments\nWell in a way um\nI Would tweak that to say that actually uh they they did start getting a notice\nTo the chagrin and anger of the army regular regular is the first division not not in the second the much but ah what happened was there was of course but if it's kind of a tribute went in with uh the uh\nOh this is Floyd given the one who really are yes\nWent in through the Wakefield took a bullet in the I knocked out and before the advantage of been tipped off about the advance or get written a story that mentioned the Marines or pursing and lay down where the no units were to be identified\nThis is the Chicago Tribune is that what it was yeah\nYeah so one out on the wires that story about marine storming yellow wood and this guy stuff and uh everybody thought given was dead so it gets to the censors off as a person's headquarters in Paris and he says well I'm a I'm going to let this through because it's the last thing I could do for zero Floyd you know see what it through that the Marines\nI didn't want to rape victims that's why the ... story here doesn't make any mention of it because this is via Chicago I see yeah is that to me that right\nIt it it it made you know it everybody but actually it was like the Marines were the only ones fight the war after that\nTo a lot of people there was like you know they never really heard but they captured the America's imagination\nLet's take them into the village themselves because one one of the aspects of gyms book that is always worrying is that once they capture a mission once they complete their mission and capture a point it's going to get worse\nYou know because the German counterattack and in this instance while they park themselves in this village the Germans then start using\nMustard gas over these next days and\nThey are the mustard gas is especially bad in the villages June eight through eleventh gym as my notes here that's when they just get rained upon by mustard gas and they don't retreat they they try to survive and their masks and many don't make\nNo what happened was they were in the village\nAnd uh they were getting pretty well pounded by artillery a and they were really worried about a truly counterattack um there's a very vital point\nEastern in Delaware they could have a lot of the woods from there any Americans attacking it was a real strong point they needed the gas is not actually used until later Kate spent several days with his men by the ... by the night of just six\nHe said you know he had like an entire regiment of people that are basically held any town with a number of people who came in the reinforcement um it was on the night of a gene their teeth he's actually pulled back lines and sat around and there's cops trees basically as a company\nAnd the Seventy eighth company and they were spotted by German a balloon is all day and write as they were getting the last feed it about midnight or all hell broke through a mustard gas a high explosive shells just rained down on them for about an hour\nAnd basically what it was all over age would write home that his company was defunct a base it was just as of a bloodbath\nI Will hold the book were going on to worst battles that had

back to the John bachelor show the seven [noise]\nOoh\nI'm joined us for this is John John Ross is here and we're having great fun with early car racing with the romance of the automobile but it's time to go to war and it's not the automobile although that taste Eddie into war he is understood to be a seventh grade\nAnd the man who lead America to war when the decision is made in early Nineteen Seventeen and the Congress votes to declare war against Germany against the Kaiser and come in on the ... the men who lead America\nTo war our college man other West Point or the ivy leagues and he goes along as a driver for the offices in the summer of Nineteen Seventeen and yet there are many instances where it's revealed to the officers to the men will become flag officers as well\nThat ... has the skill with engines and he has a skill as a mechanization\nBut they won't let him make the leap\nAnd that's important to understand that any because that's his motive here he is not just an ambitious young man I learned from you that he is ... he is trying to break in to the dominant class in America and that's not allow\nAnd it burns Eddie if he keeps a close diary much of your book is based on his writing can you see it in his notes\nAbsolutely there is a moment you know he scraps to get overseas and he's gone to fly right you just said that in what he's talking about but he has to be a driver so they take one of the top you know race car drivers and what are they do they were chauffeur well\nHe transforms he they no mechanical he gets along with everybody they say\nYou run you become the mechanical you become the engineer you put together America's new big airfield over there\nAnd you put together you take care of all the planes and building at an all like that um and but that's where you can do he says no no no I'll do that but I Need to fly\nHe gets over there and he is with all these Ivy League kids and who've never met anybody like Edie Edie is a tough talking rough around the edges kind a guy who's now the chief\nEngineer at as it in the American big American field or does he do with these Ivy League new flyers coming over and they're starting their stuff they're going to the war this is great stuff he puts them next to the German POWs\nWith ten buckets on the fields to pick up rocks\nAnd are they hate him day job Scrabble and he goes you know what we need to get this done but he's laughing you know all the way\nChief engineer dissidents September Nineteen Seventy remember now she can do everything that he's regarded as the working class as an

could say is that he's he's ... valley\nFrom class warfare itself which is destroying itself in the trenches by Nineteen Seventy yes this is a nightmare down there you don't have time and you're telling a very busy life to observe the fact that Eddie is out side of history at this point as history is a tragedy\nAnd ... is a great success where we root for re we anticipate that he's going to survive all of them become America's gray days\nHowever the way it's going to do this is self taught he takes up an aircraft into Newport he takes the Newport and\nHe teaches himself to fly away from everybody's observations he is not reckless so much a city has confidence in himself that uh I I don't have a word for it it's not self election he doesn't have a mentor\nOr he's frightened he's even to ... fear of heights fear of flying but he overcomes that you talk about his willpower what does he say it is in his notes how does he talk about his confidence\nYou know he um is for the first six months of flying he's nauseous all the time I'll throw up as cockpit will come down to throw up is you know he has high problems you had an injury to one of his eyes and an accident when he was a kid that has left him with some depth perception problems this as a kid\nA young man who flying is not natural immediate you think oh it must have been after all it wasn't at all so this is where this
