topics and twice that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria ban and all these regions that are going through wars and uh\nWe have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which is people that are wearing youth but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nAnd I find very interesting a fight and I don't know if I can share on the\nAir with you while let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings and your Russo and Hagel and marks and NGOs among others\nAnd also you know in in a certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Irish style them says real but but the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have words\nTheir God given God given God created and then there's another view\nIs to look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good well then those people need to be addressed and dealt with and of course what happens here is a relative handful of individual\nThe overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and extraction in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed doesn't view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual that is possible in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that and economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is eight and a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and a will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights\nAnd have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of uh\nOf haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light

A. so why are we doing this well I think it's part and parcel of Canada is um\nIncreasing willingness to transfer classified technologies of benefit to the Chinese state hoping that Canada will derive economic benefits by China opening up its market to Canadian goods and services so far we've certainly transferred a lot of technology a satellite systems\nTechnology that can make directed energy on laser weaponry those were last year and now this year we've\nActually help the government of China because they they um for monitoring devices were dropped by a Canadian coast guard vessel to engage in in what could be very close surveillance of a critical you as a naval military side\nSo how does this square into relations between Canada and the United states I think the United states would have good cause to feel very unhappy about this development\nGordon Charles is Canada is still in NATO member or we are indeed a our contribution as you know is modest ah I'm certainly not commensurate with the amount that that we've committed in the past but we continue to uh to be part of NATO\nA puzzle Charles does this receive attention in Canada either on the west coast to the east coast is this something that prime minister Trudeau comments about\nI haven't seen Mr Trudeau commenting on this tall nor have I seen anything in the Canadian press about it so it doesn't seem to be an issue that that is causing a lot of concern here is yet I'm what\nYou have been hearing is about the u._s.

point one which is supposed to limit Canada's ability to engage in\nIn trade agreements with China at cross purposes to the current U.S policy or being downplayed by the prime minister and the ministry of foreign affairs who say that\nThe sort of clauses largely for public perception and has no substandard impact on Canada's continuing engagement with China Gordon\nJournals do you think that there and and I don't want to be to conspiratorial but do you think that there's a relationship between the trade friction between Washington and ... on the one hand\nAnd Canada's agreement to put these Chinese with more monitoring devices into waters close to the U.S naval base I mean is one related to the other or is it is this just coincidental well\nI think that certainly in terms of the um of the tariffs that the United states imposed on I'm Canadian aluminum and steel on national security grounds are those occurred\nAfter this was already in play but certainly the the tensions between Canada the United states on trade matters I think makes it less likely the Canadian government will be paying as much attention to the inevitable us expressions of great concern\nAbout this development and about the other areas in which candidate has been facilitating um the transfer of technologies intelligence to the People's Republic of China which does go counter to the current US government policy of\nOf um you know attempting to pressure the Chinese through um restricting um economic and technological transfers\nCharles there's an election on prime minister Trudeau is campaigning is China an issue in the election\nThere has been some a suggestion that it could become a political issue um although you know it's hard to find any political party in Canada which does not seem to have strong connections with the People's Republic of China regime\nBut so far of course the conservatives have criticized the the the liberal parties negotiations with the United states and and similarly\nCanada's um extraordinary a reluctance to pay attention to our allies concerns over walk away and the suggestion the candidate will continue to have wildly equipment installed in the Canadian telecommunications network\nDespite the heads of Canadian security agencies and our allies in in Australia and the United states providing us with information which suggests that this is a very bad idea from a security perspective\nOr I just uh just a turn of this that and is there a concern in Canada about the reports in the United states of Chinese buying and cyber aggression and Chinese piracy does the is that an issue in the campaign or is that did not\nI think that there's been a general downplaying of the Chinese cyber espionage and Canada we've had you know quite serious shutdowns of our government a computer servers because of a\nChinese malware being installed on them a few years ago we had some government departments that couldn't communicate on the Internet for months due to the pervasive ness of this malware but it seems to be an issue that the government does not want to address seriously\nOr certainly not as seriously as Australia New Zealand and the

industry in other words a grab bag of material manufactured in China to be sold in the United states exported from China to the United states Gordon is this the event that is at issue about the United states attending or not if I got it right\nYes the United states is not sending a delegation to this event this event primarily intended to encourage 'em countries to export to China and ... number of people are starting to say that our refusal to go is basically hurting us business\nI say that it's part of I think a very powerful messaging on the part of the Trump Administration by saying we're trying to disengage from China even if it hurts us in the short term and by saying we're willing to take this pain in the short term\nUm were telling the Chinese that everything they think about the weakness of the American political system is wrong they cannot manipulate the administration that the administration intends to separate us from China and if you're an export dominated economy like China that's a chilling message John\nSo this is about China in Coeur ... encouraging act it imports into China's that's what this is about it have propaganda\nOr event yeah and that's what they are that's the way that they're building it and they're getting the Europeans and everybody else to go there sending delegations\nAnd are tending their and important economy as opposed to the facts which is that they are entirely an export model\nYes I think they're doing this to try to dampen down a trade tensions and to try to build a coalition against the United states\nAllan uh you have a watch very carefully these years and now it's the second year of the Trump Administration dealing with China what is your measure of the U.S not attending a Potemkin trade show by the pie LA\nJohn Potemkin trade show is exactly right\nBecause as Gordon put at China is anything but an import friendly economy whatever propaganda they're trying to put out and what I Would add to Gordon's very trenches analysis here is that it's especially promising this move\nIf it indicates that the Trump Administration is moving away from its stated hope that the trade war that it's conducting with China hum\nIs going to succeed primarily if it ends up persuading shining to open up markets to us and\nOther foreign competition and play fair and treat exports are from\nEverywhere else in the world just like a treats Chinese made goods that is a noble am it's certainly been the standard boilerplate for us trade policy for the entire world for about for at least Thirty years probably longer but with China it's especially misguided because\nThe Chinese have no intention of opening or keeping markets open to foreign competition one moment longer than they absolutely have to and what I mean by that is\nChina recognizes that there was still good it's critical to its economic development that it needs to cure from overseas\nBut once it's managed to steal the relevant intellectual property once it's managed to conduct the appropriate reverse engineering um that foreign product and the company that makes it gets chewed up and spit\nOut Gordon Allen so what we're really talking about is the Trump Administration are encouraging companies to move their supply chains out of China and of course uh once that occurs then um the u._s. is certainly much less dependent on the Chinese economy because we hear a lot of people say and and they are absolutely right\nThat the two economies are intertwined but if there are no longer intertwined that has all sorts of implications not only gonna trade area but also of course across the spectrum of our relations with Beijing so I agree with you or if that's what the Trump Administration is trying to do and it appears that that's the direction they're going\nThen we have got a watershed moment in American history and that we're ... we're looking at it entirely\nRelationship with China going forward that's right and I would only hope\nThat the Trump Administration if indeed this is it's a shame and I do think it is a but I Would only hope that the administration would make the aim of explicit\nBecause this this drive to reduce American engagement with with the Chinese economy that that's ... that's in fact contrary to the conventional wisdom completely incompatible whether this Dr\nHas of course run into tremendous resistance at home here in in the U.S\nAnd it's going to be crucial to overcoming that resistance for the president to explain the stakes the longer term stakes to the American people in a reasonably comprehensive\nWay and we haven't had that yet and I think that's a really important missing element to the administration's China strategy\nAllen have you heard anecdotes about a slowdown here because of the tension with China\n[noise] you hear a lot of anecdotes but certainly you're not seeing it in the economic data or whatever and uh\nI grew up being taught that that data trumps anecdotes anytime\nA and in particular we've I mean we've had now several months of steel tariffs much less time with China's Pacific tariffs but several months with steel and aluminum tariffs\nAnd it's clear Isabel from every major data series that the American government been puts out that not only are those industries that you steal and that and that usually with him not being harmed by these towers yet they are actually out performing the rest of manufacturing in most respects\nThat total thirty two pages are classified either top secret or secret pertaining to his request now because they're classified we can't tell you what's at um a cat you know release them [laughter] so uh but finally it has this dovetails with what was already in the news\nA little bit originally reported by Fox News and an article that was subsequently taken down in the course of a lawsuit but the article was correct in which Seth Rich was a ... is the one who would be downloaded the files onto a thumb drive up loaded them into a drop box\nAnd that information was passed to joining us on July ... leaks\n... Seth\nRich worked at the DNC was young\nI Am very able and sophisticated member of the ... Democratic National committee in May of twenty sixteen goes the suspicion that rich downloaded information that subsequently turned up with Julian Assange And Julian Assange at the time and since then\nHas said what is he said about his source and separate Julian ... actually\nIt was ... was a was murdered on the July ... and then a few weeks later Julian Assange came out an issue to twenty thousand dollar cash reward for information pertaining to whoever murder or such rich and then the next day and an interview with Dutch television talked about the need to protect sources\nThat he's never come out publicly and said Seth Rich was my source\nBut the you can look at the history of working late and never have they issued a reward for anybody else who is a method untimely yeah\nAll right let's leave in terror Larry 'cause we're not going to answer these questions were just raising right what what the F ... a request has turned up from the NSA\nThat there's a link in some fashion with documents we do not have between ... now the allegation and twenty six team that I Believe Russia get is still working with is that the the documents and the DNC servers were hacked by Russian professionals ... fancy bear chiefly cozy bad the G argue\nAnd that those documents were passed him Julian Assange to embarrass weekend in some fashion under caught Mrs Clinton's campaign\nDoes that that does that that information also connects to the fact that crowd strike was called in by the DNC this is a a cybersecurity firm and crowds I took possession of all of those servers all of that hardware and software\nAnd told us that it was fancy Baron ... cheaply cozy bear\nThat ... what is ... ... what is crowd strike what are we learned about crowd struck\nSo crowds strikes founder Dimitri ... which is uh basically comes out of the Ukrainian George family\nA very much anti Russian [noise] um what what's fascinating is that the ... nobody in the federal government the federal law enforcement agency has been able to get access to the survivors the coup inclusion that was fancy bear and that was Russian is based entirely upon the work the crowd strike did\nThere was a big problem with the work the crowd strike yet\nThey started work on the seventh of may\nIf they did their work right they should have\nCome in and one twenty six teams haven't said may twenty sixteen after the report exhausting crack to the report of the ...\nIf they were doing things properly they would have come in and turned off all of the computers and installed new software and get everybody in the passwords which would have broken the the the the the linked to a hacker if there was a hacker\nBut what happened is the emails were actually downloaded on the twenty fifth of may and now we know from an article that appeared in Esquire Magazine in two thousand sixteen in October that crowd strike that not shut off the computers until June towns\nAnd did not start installing software to that weekend of June tenth or this is just laughable\nBecause they claimed that they knew that there was a Russian hacking going on as early as may and yet did nothing to stop it that then gets taken the last the last ... the emails that appear on the wiki leaks ah archive is the twenty fifth of may\nSo you've got to raise the question of what in the world was cross strike\nBut on top of that then we have the analysis was done by Bill Binnie who is the former technical director of the national Security Agency of bell is a is a truth genius in this area and he he was able to take\nThe meta data that appeared uh if you recall that on June fourteenth or June fifteenth solar by the name of goose or for two point oh surfaces\nTo suffer a to point no claims to have these documents and in fact both crowds strike and Robert Mueller the special counsel has all pointed to goose suffer as proof that it's Russia\nBecause they look at the stylistic parts of the medical data such as language usage\nBill didn't look at style he looked at simple math and science there is a transfer rate and you know how fast information can be transferred over the Internet if it's a hack vice how fast it could be transferred if you put it onto a thumb drive\n... he discovered was the transfer rape that's in the medical data other documents that goes for two point oh put up with\nRobert Mueller claims is proof that it's Russia in fact could not be transferred over the Internet it could only occur through a transfer a download it onto a\nAll right we've established a very important ... questions now about ... about Julian Assange about crowd strike about the DNC server\nWe've also developed information most recently that crowd strike was a was a firm that was connected to the Democratic committee and was represented by a man named Sussman who was in a ... who is\nAn attorney for ... now subsequently identified as the from the higher Glenn Simpson and fusion GPS in order to create the dusty against Donald Trump\nWe also know that ... been represented crowd strike\nSo crowds jak being called in is entirely consistent with the DNC he's a law firm ... but it also raises the question is why the FBI was not provided access to those servers sometime in may and June it never has had access so we we ... we can answer that question\nWhat what you presented here Larry is that the questions that we presume these last two years were answered were not answered adequately or there are possibilities that haven't been explored is that all correct\nThat is very ... is that there was an important like concert on this was motivated by the excellent our you spend with Steve Cohen last night\nBecause it highlights that we tried to portray Russia is this great enemy perpetrating some tremendous fraud against us and yet it's not based on a shred of actual credible evidence it's based on manufactured evidence\nAnd in particularly if you look at the documents they point to as evidence that it was the Russians\nIt has such clumsy fingerprints on it that it it's deliberately design to leave trademarks in their fingerprints and\nA and elements to point to Russia well no intelligence outfit worth its salt conducts an operation like that particularly the Russians\nAnd yet we've returned to Russia's intelligence outfit into a subject to a clown show and are are accusing them of something that was put into various when in fact it looks like what happened\nIs Seth Rich who had his own motivations he was a Bernie Sanders supporter I'm too old and he was at odds with a couple of his bosses at the DNC had every reason in the world to\nDownload all ...

I've been really a quite aggressive in recent years and there's been on certain the in East Asia in Taiwan included\nAbout whether America would do something about so I think this has been helpful and reassuring those who bought the line for the Trump Administration was very transactional on trade and might be ignoring South China sea and China's territorial aggression\nSteve is there a concern in Taipei about a miscalculation or accident that could lead to an escalation and these episodes where warships traveling at high speeds out on the open seas could misunderstand or miss direct like that incident with a Decatur\nOh I think the answer to that is yes but mostly military circles I find that concern it'd be great if the military circles in Taiwan but also a military circles with us on the map particular they will also have\nSomewhat of a concern about miscalculation on the Chinese part and we've lived with some of these miscalculations in the not too distant asked when terms of\nThe air maneuvers that led to the the three crisis severely Bush administration and some of the the the base confrontations we've had but in Taiwan generally I think the biggest concern is that the U.S becomes either distracted by or a neighbor with\nIts dealings with China and Taiwan just becomes a on that is lost in that match\nGordon Steve you know if you go back in the last year which is the first year of the Trump Administration um you get a sense that the president and the national security team around\nHim in Washington really weren't quite sure what to do with China and it did look at some points that they were willing to do with China over a number of things including North Korea\nThis year um there's a very different tone that I sense and you're in Washington and I'm not but I I get a just a sense that the administration decided that it is going to disengage from China and obviously that has implications\nI mean do you read the mood in Washington the same way or do you see in somewhat different tones\nOh I think there's contending news in Washington and within the administration to president seems very clear\nThat he is simultaneously open to a deal but very burn on trying to reset the context in which that deal would be ... and certainly in the run up to the ... the mid term election and probably his reelection twenty twenty\nI Would put very low the odds\nOf some kind of a grand deal on trade or security ... have you uh but as you know he has seven intention to consider another meeting with Kim Jong un and the north Korean negotiations could go and very unpredictable ways\nBut for the most part I think Washington was very much in the warm bath conventional thinking on China for so long that it's been unsettled\nBy what uh was I think articulated by vice president Pence of the kind of bill of particulars of the many ways China has upset the status quo and the administration's determinations or respond but they haven't really detail how they'll respond and that seems to be to talk of Washington now\nI Do not recall the Obama administration or the or the Bush administration sending two warships instead the Taiwan Strait for sixteen hours perhaps you can recall for me but does this mean that the Trump Administration is seeking to embrace the defense of Taiwan\nWell I think that Secretary Mattis has been very very clear about that the truth message he has ... I think you're right in terms of the precedent in terms of uh as as far as the trend that the battalion straight go in close proximity\nUh but this I think has more to do it's freedom of navigation and the claims in the south China either does just the Taiwan Strait\nA and there are strong think that going back to the tourist and confirmation hearing as a matter of affirmation hearing\nAbout the south China Sea and this is the first time we've seen I think a stomach and to liberate rushed back of the Chinese and happens to be the Taiwan Strait but I think it's meant more broadly as a signal that China not Jeff\nGordon one more question what is going to be the ultimate test of relations between Washington and what are you looking\nFor in terms of of how these two capitals worked together are we going to be closer are we going to be for the report let's say six months from now\nWe should be closer together uh and I think it's actually a time of strategic opportunity for a while there's trade friction and maybe some military question going on in U.S China relationship\nTo put forward vote positive proposals of things that would be good for America and good for Taiwan on trade and so I think at the time of opportunity they have their local election they're ever in the midterms at the end of November in one spot beyond that distraction hopefully\nPresidents I and her team

where the jobs come from the wealthy people put their money to work\nAnd that creates the conditions for the rest of us to work I welcome Danny ...\nDenny is going to tell me what a family offices here in the twenty first century been through changes since John Rockefeller put together the first family office a hundred years ago I learned from the books but then it's going to put us to work today in the United states and around the world for\nFamily offices which are changing\nJenny a very good evening to you thank you and welcome Cindy family office according to the dictionary\nIs one well to do family that hires who hire people to manage their accounts they're ill liquid and liquid assets and to look out for future generations has it changed so much since John Rockefeller good evening to thank you\nThank you for having me um I think it hasn't changed in in in in the idea for somebody else this is really it's having neutral people work for you and have\nNo other incentive by your goals to take care of your financial needs of your legal needs of your children's a school of state funding taking care of your future of the narrative\nAnd again the important thing is done by us so they are only working for you they're not getting\nPaid as opposed to ... a bank or a private equity firm that's going to take it sees no matter what you have a team of people who only concern themselves with your assets right they cost you\nObviously you pay them a salary but they are non biased when I'm working with a private banker I'm going to end up with some products that may not be the best for me because he sells them to me because he's getting a commission for instance\nYou're DC at D.C hyphen finance dot com is the website what can you do for people who are well to do and want to know whether the family offices for them what we tell them if they contact you with us through the website\n[noise] well we do we do gatherings we do conferences that are held in a New York Miami used in Dallas Toronto London in Israel where we're from which is interesting and I can talk about later\nUm where they there's no media by the way you know a a Wall Street journal and he wanted that covering it blows to the press is the way we see in that sense yeah we we did they feel more comfortable when they're not you know pictures taking these spoke to that and stuff like that\nI'm a generalist myself whether I'm an ex students just a couple of Wall Street for global smuggled into the wall Street Journal and Israel\nAnd um they learn in a private setting about lots of different topics from investments to a state funding philanthropy for instance in Dallas this week or next week we have a a very low for somebody to talking about marrying into money not think how sensitive that topic is she brings her husband\nAnd she's one of the wealthiest families in Dallas and she's going to talk about the challenges he had marrying into money and what comes with it\nAnd both of them are going to talk about humor from these angle and she's from her so when you have a private setting and you hear about both investments and other topics that are very sensitive you your child's future you know addiction is one of the biggest problems for some reason our diction suicide for the\nThe very serious topics at ten year that keeps these guys awake at night and when they hear about that from professional people from the fears that are sharing that with them and they get some network with one another to investigate her own which is a different topic I can talk about that's what they actually\nWon All right now family officers can come to you for these conferences people who want to know what to do with their money that they do they need a family office did they need a private bank of the bankers I'm going to let them go easily after all they've got this enormous amount of money right so you would offer the difference between a family office\nAnd a private bank or or a private equity firm let's quickly to find that what's a level for a private off for a for a family office to work what level of of well\nSo that different levels in different places I Would say roughly in many would argue about that but probably north of a hundred million dollars is a single family all single family which means is that like you hear like the ... it's a single a group of people that fourth only for you in that if my name is gates I have a family right right right\nAnd then I Would say between ten to a hundred maybe twenty two hundred is the heightened with individuals or like the old shrine that's not to have to think of themselves and they would normally work with a move that someone\nMultifamily office which works the same way but it's a group of unrelated people who have a team working for them\nRight they work with different families that don't it doesn't justify for them to hire an entire team by themselves\nThe family offices are extremely desirable I read from the point of view of IPO's or start up Israel is a startup nation the U.S out here has a few start it's every once in a while our family offices attracted to start a\nVery much so these guys are open minded they are like institutional investors incision investor needs to return the money some points so that's a problem that can look invest after a certain point they cannot invest in smaller companies they have a lot of like\nLet's see than a lot of rules within that they need to operate in somebody else's don't and the beautiful thing about some of the office\nI can come to you right now and put your glasses on you and tell you even though you don't do anything in the art in virtual reality\nPut those that's his own you until you this is the future and this is why the future you may fall in love with each right now which is called by the way a emotional investment like they do with art sometimes and you can come to your father or your mother or whatever it is and we got to be involved in this thing\nThe only ones that can make decisions that data somebody else's it so I think they love the cold is you you see that they invest heavily into gold you to diversify the risks and the love the adventure they love to look at different times of tech related investments absolutely\nOf refugees immigrants seeking to blow off or being plead or in some fashion gain entry to the United states Monica a very good evening to you your comment please on the migrant column that we see on TV every night\nThe evidence doesn't go one way or the other in the polls but the anecdotes say that this has up that the Republican Party has it upset the nation Monica including the independence good evening to\nHi good evening John well you know what Donald Trump was elected for a variety of reasons economic national security and so on but if we were to isolate the single most important reason why Trump was elected\nI Would argue and I think a lot of people would argue it was his very aggressive stand on illegal immigration he built his candidacy and he'd largely one office on a vowed to halt the illegal immigrant invasion\nBuild the border wall and enforce existing laws\nSo because he owes so much of his presidency to that promise which he genuinely means and has has been trying to to accomplish in the last year and a half since he's been president he sticks so much of it on that and people are looking to him to followed through\nNow that we have this ah this this invasion marching through Mexico marching inexorably toward our southern border the president has now said that he is prepared to deploy the military to seal the border to prevent this invasion from entering\nThis raises a really profound question John that has so far been unanswered when does a mob of foreigners used to storm our border\nBecome an invading army that would then justify military action to retell it\nWe don't have an answer to that question get there is going to be a showdown because the president is serious about feeling the order not allowing these people it will he authorized the use of lethal force\nWhat I what is going to happen when this caravan of ... this army of invaders get to the border we don't know that yet but we are now in an era\nOf mobs and this is what my column in the Washington Times about tomorrow because\nI call it Trump calls the bluff with the left wing mobs\nThat this caravan\nIs the latest mob but it's also the biggest of them all but we are now being bombarded by left wing mobs\nEvery where we look for in the Senate confirmation vote of Brett Kavanaugh to social media to antifa mobs roaming our city streets to progressive gangs hounded elected officials where they live work and died vandalizing their offices\nAnd of course the biggest most most powerful Bob up to the mall is the media it's a virtual mob especially when it gangs up with entities like Facebook Google Twitter so we're looking at mobs\nAnd especially left wing mobs in every direction the president of the United states is doing his best John to fend off and I think when you're seeing the momentum move and a lot of these key races toward Republicans\nIt's because conservatives Republicans and independents and disaffected Democrats\nAre all responding to the onslaught against this country\nThe mention of democratic Bob's takes me to my youth Monica always happy journey and Nineteen sixty eight August I'm Nineteen sixty eight which was a tumultuous months in world affairs the Soviets moved against\nUh Prague against Chuck ... surprising everyone of Vietnam was collapsing around the Johnson administration the peace talks were going nowhere in Paris\nAnd in Chicago a very large contingent of democratic activists we now call them progressive or ... charge by the ... by the Chicago police and Mayor Daley was screaming at the podium in the Chicago convention hall during the nomination of\nA ... a Hubert Humphrey for ... president of United States that wrecked the Democratic power so much so that Richard Nixon your mentor was elected ever since then Monica the Democrats have\nNot been happy about those events and have talked about how they never want that to happen again\nSo how do we get here Monica having sworn it off in sixty eight why do we see these demonstrations in twenty Eighteen to they have no memory\nWell they haven't sworn it off and I write extensively about this in my column coming tomorrow and the Washington Times Johnston thank you for giving me a chance to talk about it I write about how in the mid Nineteen sixties\nToo radical left wing professors Richard Claritin and Francis fog and argued for accelerating the transition to socialism by overwhelming and then collapsing the social welfare system\nA few years after that ... the radical revolutionary\nTalked about destroying the capitalist democratic order by what the ... humiliation and mockery and mirrors and yes mob\nSays forward John to the great recession you went to hundreds of union and other thugs descending on bankers homes\n[noise] then after that you had the Occupy Wall Street mobs out there in city streets committing violent crime and trafficking illegal drugs desiccated\nOn police cars [laughter]\nThis is what the radical far left does they manufacture may have designed to advance the progressive agenda but what they fail to understand or maybe they just don't care is that the United states is still a center right country and when these things happen as they are now\nWell you get a backlash because the great silent majority is ready to put his foot down yet again as it did in twenty sixteen and as it did yes in Nineteen sixty eight by electing Richard Nixon\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two because we saw a repeat of the music and six and seven to two with George McGovern leading the progress of the Democrats\nSo Monica we have a story here where the Republicans are responding or in time to Kavanaugh first and now the caravan\nIs that enough conventional wisdom says the house goes from Mrs Pelosi the speaker perhaps by six plus six perhaps by plus sixteen and the Senate dais Republican and perhaps picks up to three or four seats are you comfortable with conventional wisdom\nI never comfortable with conventional wisdom remember John I came on this program\nWhat about twenty four hours after Donald Trump came down the escalator and\nCandy and schools me on hold and I told you and I told you I Do not count him out I write likely to be the nominee and the president right\nAnd I went against it every bit of conventional wisdom I have now is that on this program and others that I Believe\nThe Republicans will hold the house narrowly narrowly but I think they will hold it and what first of all but it got instinct but now I'm really examining numbers among some key races in the house\nAt those places collectively have narrowed they've tightened Republican intensity\nIs way up and we can attribute it to the eye for an invasion about to storm our border we could also attributed kick having all the way he was treated at a left wing Bob and sell on\nYou can attribute to to a number of things I Would add in the economy which is incredibly strong\nThanks to President Trump and the Republican agenda\nAnd we're going to get the GDP number for the third quarter first estimate on friday morning so we'll have that number all next week before the election\nAnd that could be a great political gift to the president to end the Republicans as well boiling them a look at the Democrats the less they can't help themselves are out there ... acting thing\nAnd I think it turns off a lot of independent voters and remember\nThe group then elected Donald Trump Republicans or conservatives are even independent it was just affected Democrats blue collar folks in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio Michigan Wisconsin they still haven't changed their mind not Donald Trump glad they voted for him\nBecause their lives have improved renegotiated NAFTA\nRenegotiating trade deals tax cuts deregulation it's all served their direct\nEconomic purposes you add all of these things together I Do not think there's a blue wave your the prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders backing away from that whole that whole concept trying to lower expectations I think that the great majority is not done

... show the national security adviser John Bolton visiting Azerbaijan in Baku for conversations with President ... than the national security apparatus about\nThe Caspian Sea bass and the energy supplies from the Caspian Sea bass and all the base and\nTransported through Georgia through turkey all the way is the ambition to Italy and eventually all the way to Romania under the black sea also discussing the unresolved frozen conflict\nOf ... the Armenia and I was about Xiong tangles since the late twentieth century and the end of the Soviet Union\nThat is not resolved I welcome professor Brenda Schaffer the center for Eurasian Russian and Eastern European studies\nAt Georgetown University Brenda a very good evening to you Mr both in statement following the meeting with the leadership in Baku says if the U.S is committed to a peaceful settlement is that consistent with what we know about Armenia is still not acknowledging\nSome of the steps that we're ... we're line we're line many years ago and have not been moved on also\nWe know that our media is a very close working partnership with Russia also we know the the new prime minister of Armenian met most recently with Rouhani and the discussion was about\nA going to Disneyland was about the Iranian sanctions show Mr Bowles was intention for a peaceful settlement but it's just all wrapped up in Iran and Russia and the enmity between the United states and those countries good evening to\nGood evening John le ... actually you needed to lay out all this complicated Web about about this health caucuses because the fact that it is the meeting physical meeting ground of the Iran Turkey and Russia is why this in this\nRegion of such importance and despite its geographic sent ... a as a meeting ground between again like Europe and Asia\nUh all bordering turkey Iran and Russia um there have been very few high level us visits in the past decade or to the region so it's very a welcome that that ah John Bolton ... chose to visit this house called 'cause it's a three countries at the south the caucuses in fact\nThe last visit to either by John By a senior cabinet level official was the\nSecretary of the navy in two thousand Fifteen and before that a Secretary Clinton you know the only really to senior visits over\nA decade but this was very different in the Nineteen nineties you know us secretary of state a senior military officials into the region the U.S had a presence us with part of the game and it's very nice to see a John Bolton returning to the region and and and I think it's an important message in the in that respect that the U.S is back\nIf he therefore Iran is either for Russia as she there for ... you and I both visited is farmland but it's been abandoned because of the fighting the Armenians or at the front line they show routinely there's\nHarassment fire there are casualties now and again certainly there are a threat along the front line they blocked the river to deprive water to the farm land so is there to settle that or is there to worry about Iran sanctions and Russian interference\nWell actually John I think all these issues are are interconnected because what's Russia's main will ever to control the south Caucasus region and other regions like Ukraine and Moldova is actually the conflict feels to is actually you know if you take the going to call about it was\nYou know Ninety thousand uh Armenians inside a Azerbaijan I'm a of hide in South of the show something similar a hundred and twenty ... Ninety thousand South Asians these were not\nRegional wars these what these were you know almost village a conflicts and Russia really turn them into a regional wars 'cause it's a very good a lever\nOne thing that I Hope John Bolton would be very different than most of us us predecessors that us efforts have pet and conflict resolution of tend to focus on year of on ... you know getting the two sides together to talk to agree it's really not about you're unemployed cool it's really honestly about Moscow and and and Washington and that\nUh you know with our understanding how Russia uses this conflict or to hold the region hostage on it'll be very difficult uh to as all that and I think another point you brought up the ... really relevant is that\nUm I think I mean it needs to acknowledge it physical presence and the gonna ... places diplomatic game which says well there's Armenian there's than you know ... ... car law forces as if it's some separate entity and I think it's not\nReally a way that build any confidence to solve the conflict you know your I've been I've been to the region you know there is Armenian soldiers serving their the previous two presidents have I mean you are actually from the gonna Carl Bob\nUh our our Armenian citizens serve in the military and in the region or you know to ... to say they're not there would be if Israel said you know we're not in the west bank that's like local today and forces you know if it's something a four and so I think\nI think it's also important that are that Armenia ... you know come clean and recognizes its own presence in this region\nWe have news or you mention Israel the commanding general of the ... of the Republican votes to budge on forces visiting in Israel for the first time\nI've visited with the as the budget armed forces or earlier this year\nAnd I saw a lot of first rate Israeli equipment I've heard over the years that I was about Sean and Israel work together chiefly ... that's the benefit of Israel when and if there's a need to use basing ... north of Iran\nHowever it is to just that there's more of a of developing relationship for arms and training\n[noise] yeah I think you know many you know media and sometimes foreign officials\nI'm a talk about the relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel's if it's some you know marriage of convenience is if it's just about well interest but you know because everybody's on the Shia Muslim and and and Israel is predominantly a Jewish that for some reason there would be some structure into their relations but\nI think it's exactly the opposite I think that that there's there is there is um ... this whole region has nothing as we discuss the in the previous discussion between this\nHas nothing to do with with a religion just like\nA Iran and Armenia have very close you know relations when you know our Armenians occupies territory that lead to you know nine hundred thousand or she Azerbaijan needs to become refugees it doesn't bother the Islamic republic of Iran the same thing there's zero anti Israel sentiments\nA in Azerbaijan I visit there frequently I'd see ... you know probably the Jewish person I feel more welcome a in Azerbaijan than I Do in most places in in in Europe\nUm ... and again this is actually it's kind of interesting because there were two not only is this the first visit of the chief of staff of us are based on in Israel but the last major visit of a senior Azerbaijan the official was may fourteenth does it does that date say anything to join\nSaudi foreign policy has been quite counterproductive from our interests and I would argue the Saudis as well and so the purported reason why the Saudis ah began attacking 'em forces in Yemen\nWas to kick Iranian influence out of a country that's right on their border\nUm perhaps a a a noble um interests but here we are several years later and rainy and interest or an influence is actually higher in Yemen than it was when they started in that's holy apart from\nThe humanitarian disaster that this war is produced with famine and cholera and attacks on civilians and and everything else and of course that also drew both the Saudis and the ... away from the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria so that they could focus on Yemen so it has not achieved its objectives and actually I think it's been a largely counterproductive\nThe next on the list the concern Qatar I visited Qatar earlier this year and that was six months into the Saudi led us he joined embargo of cops are this is the Gulf Cooperation council\nI'd say you could take out the cooperation the Gulf council broken down the U.S is extremely uncomfortable because we've got military at risk\nCan the Saudis be can can this moment this moment where the Saudis are vulnerable\nCannot be used to calm the few\n[noise] I think it can and I think it should be a again here\nThe Saudi ambassador ambition was to get tough with the galleries or they said the galleries were supporting terrorism and we're too close to Iran they issued a long list of demands slapped on the embargo\nUm do ... did not in fact meet and those demands has survived the embargo um but because of the interruption\nOf economic linkages has turned in part to Iran and so the relationship between gutter and Iran is far more now than it was before the embargo began\nFrom an American perspective still largest US military base in the region as in gutter and of course the Saudis and ... and others are security partners as well and so now we have\nPartners on each side of this fragment of juicy block which doesn't make life easy for us and so a really as I think a State Department spokesman er spokesperson said was the view of Mike Pompeo Iran has emerged as the beneficiary of of the state of affairs here\nToo yeah so Ron is now entered into this they're watching the show gee tragedy and is this a an unexpected benefit for them\nAbsolutely you know it the Iranians have been\nA notably silent\nAnd and this and uh you know in American domestic politics there's the rule of thumb that if your opponent is in the process of destroying himself or his reputation don't get those way just to keep your mouth shut and watch and toaster good fortune and unfortunately I think that's where the Iranians are today because they look at\nUm not just the division between the United states and Saudi Arabia that this is likely to um create but the empowerment of turkey I'm the sort of moral diminish meant of Saudi Arabia the degree to which this has made business and uh and governments around the world less\nInclined to work with a and cooperate with Saudi Arabia and from the rain and perspective that's all good news and they didn't have to do anything to achieve that\nNext on the list and this is more difficult to see but a Hariri the prime minister the son of the slain prime minister was for a time in Riyadh and the question was was he there on his own free will the Saudi Arabians they're not saying he's free to come and go he says vacationing\nBut when you mentioned Hariri you are plunged into Lebanon and Syria what are the Saudis up to in Beirut ... what is their party average\n[noise] so a year ago the Saudis um concluded that they did not like the fact that uh has a law who's a sponsor of courses or Iran or wasn't coalition government with Saad Hariri the prime minister of Lebanon\nA and that they wanted to try to marginalize a ... political influence and thereby ... deal a step back to Iran\nAgain a not a bad ambition um but it\nBackfired ah they lured a Saad Hariri to the ... to Saudi Arabia a forced him under obvious dress a two resigned his position as prime minister on Saudi TV a with no real explanation although he was required to end did blame Iran um\nBut the result of this was it didn't hold and within a matter of weeks or where he was back having rescinded his resignation he still prime minister and it had the effect of actually increasing the political support for Hezbollah rather than decreasing it so it was one more\nUm kick in the counterproductive column\nYou mentioned Israel as a plus because Israel and Saudi Arabia have moved very close together these last years and Mohammed bin Salman is the center of that rapprochement but I see that the Israelis are very worried about ...\nBecause having moved so far with Saudi Arabia they're concerned about losing a you also mentioned a positive that the Saudis were ready to back us up in the event the\nIran sanctions a damaged the world's supply of oil especially if our European allies\nAre both those positive now at risk Richard\nI Would save the positive with respect Israel is at some risk in the sense that um ... for the Israelis as for the United states the Saudis or a less valuable strategic partner if you could call it that um than they were before the surgery\nA murder given the program that's been directed and there are toward Riyadh ah I think the oil is a different matter I think that the Saudis\nAh it's it's theoretically possible that they would react to any pressure\nThe world puts on them or with such anger that they would reduce their oil exports and not make up for the reduction and Iranian exports of crude and so forth but of course that would cost them economically precisely at the moment or when they have a big plan to grow and diversify the economy\nI'm not saying I won't do it but I think it's unlikely um [noise]\nBut ah but what you said also points to you know the potential kinds of upsides that there are in this relationship which is why I say don't just get rid of the thing let's modify its terms\nUm they have stopped their previous hostility toward Israel they are helpful when it comes to pressure on Iran and certainly our counterterrorism intelligence cooperation other things as well\nThe concern here is how to go forward and this is a tabletop exercise it's almost like a game of risk in which you're trying to reestablish relationships after\nUh after you see conflict between South America and Africa for example so what is adequate you mentioned the global Magnitsky Act I've also had conversations talking about\nUh the convention on torture or the possibility of the international criminal court getting involved is that is that ... the U.S would go along with a criminal charge against people in Saudi Arabia\nWill certainly not through the international criminal court I mean and the Trump Administration and John Bolton the national security measure have made clear that they would like to deal legitimize the international criminal court and my understanding is that Saudi Arabia doesn't recognize that stress diction anyway so I don't think that's [noise]\nAn avenue or the global Magnitsky sanctions would the sanctions economic sanctions target financial measures visa bans things like that that are directed at the perpetrators and that I think will happen I'm just in the past Eighteen hours or show I think the secretary of state telegraphed as much\nUm then you've got the broader question of beyond punishing those who\nAre are immediately responsible or as far up the chain as you can determine are responsible or what do you do about the relationship more broadly and here\nI where I come down is that unity of measures are you know to some degree necessary but they're certainly not sufficient well this is an opportunity and to reset some aspects of the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and to try to move them in a more constructive\nDirection so that they're not engaged in a kind of counter productive uh actions or that I described in instead of a you know use this as a wake up call to try to wind down some of the thing particularly the war in Yemen\nRichard Fontaine is president of the center for new American security I'm John bachelor there's just a John ... [noise]\n\n\nBernie ...\nIs it\nA shot\n\n[noise]\nForty seven and clear I'm\nBob round the stories that we talking about on Seventy seven WABC mayor de Blasio saying the package mailed to CNN headquarters was an act of terror telling New Yorkers there were no other credible threats at this time\nOf the New York city will not be intimidated [noise] that we're going to go about our lives undeterred the very concept of terrorism is to change us so we will not allow that to happen\nAnd the fighting from ... point of view because he was a veteran of the war\nWas it accepted at the time to listen to these officers report this back home or was this uh what is it necessary to wait till after the end of the war and when they were back home reflecting is that when people would read this\nOr despair about the about the pointless and\nWell I think you know I actually just soon [noise] you know was was involved during the war and uh\nYou know he he he you know wrote sort of you know publicly his opposition to the war and how to be sort of you know quickly sent a you know to a mental hospital 'cause I think you know it would've\nIt could have a ... you know he could he risk being sort of tried for treason so [noise]\nYou know I think it was he was saying these things quite early on when it was very you know controversial\n... clarity they declared him with shell shock and they sent him to a war hospital but he wasn't was he shell shocked or was he just at the center and they didn't want to deal with it because of his heroism\nWell I think you know he he kind of what I take it that he accepted you know the diversion but because you know eight and realize that you know he would be [noise]\nPresumably tried for treason or you know could I Would be a you know would have been very serious so I don't ah I mean he's actually I mean it's quite interesting because you know Bob Barker and Leno has written about him in contemporary novels and\nUm you know it's it's a\nIt's a kind of well known case now but certainly at the time I think it was extremely shocking\nLet's go to William Faulkner who is the great American novelist who was in the war as well you've included ... which is from a longer work uh this is a landscape there were often in your book Pete they're often these landscapes and I felt there were other worldly uh\nOccasionally there'd be a geographic notice if you've taken them from longer work so I understand I'm not approaching this is the complete book but it felt like we were wondering for a landscape of death and surprise almost as if it was a horror novel is that how it relates to you\nOr certainly yeah I mean you know you get a sense very much of the kind of landscape of an of people you know being very very lost um and [noise] you know not not knowing you know when they saw other soldiers whether they were\nYou know on their side or the end of may and I think you know this this reflected that sort of\nFeeling you know on on the back to front\nThe this particular patrol or company has a wounded back and then they're wondering ... along the landscape that suddenly changes into\nA book which you'd have to say shallow risks or ... or ... or dips in the landscape that puzzle them until finally they fall down into what is that a cave I thought we were going to fall to hell when I read it\n[laughter] well it's you know some in the trenches that of being dog you know by by the Germans and uh [noise] you know which they then discover\nAnd sitting dead in the trench are Senegalese troops are you included that then you have another ... other entries in the book to remind us that the colonial troops were drafted\nCompelled are driven into the war how ... how to frame it today these are men not from Europe who were part of the British Empire the French Empire the German empire and were thrown into the battlement without any without even knowledge where they were\nWell I mean they are probably asleep you know they were [noise] so I mean they were promised they were promised money ... and the problem is you know so sort of political freedoms which were never in\nA delivered but certainly um you know and and some of them I mean you know ... wanting to do a good job of fighting you know for the imperial country I mean certainly [noise]\nThe India and you know many of the Indian soldiers who had enormous casualty rights as did the cynical age you know fought valiantly and uh [noise] you know I'm ... now their contribution is is being recognized and and they're\nYou know clearly seen you know as having made an important contribution to to the struggle\nLet me read Faulkner when he first comes across as seen this is a ... she's a trench that he is protecting us has tumbled into about the

College London he teaches Defense Studies\nAnd right now we're witnessing the legend building of the Germans who must restore order later\nThere's a there's a correspondent you you cite in your book Nick and I want to emphasize him his name is ... he's a German officer you use his letters and quote and this letter you reproduce in detail\nHe writes a Seventeen October he writes to his father he talks about he asks the question to us ... father\nAre we really the criminals as we had been labeled do the German people who've suffered and bled for their existence unlike any people before really deserve this he then goes on to say we have not get lost our honor\nAnd the most telling lawn and his letter to Nick and I need your and translation in order for us all to give our grandchildren a clear conscience\nWhat is he talking about what is he worried about what is the feedback home\nWell I think he's he's certainly worried about what the verdict of history will be if they gave in at this point and that whether they be shamed and of course German soldiers are being\nFed a steady diet to propaganda about what will happen if they get into the alliance I'm On the you know it's going to be awfully terrible and it can be worse than the ravages of podium so he's\nHe's saying we have to do what we have to do we have to maintain our own and we have to fight song and of course comedy except that the situation has gone beyond the tool that losing the war because remember most of the gym and people indeed most of the gym and armies and said nothing ... stories of victory for over four years now\nAnd the and they are still fighting an enemy soil and that for the idea that they could lose is is almost inconceivable\nThe council of war looting door fun Seventeen October prince max is there the other generals are drawn up there looking at the map they're looking at the ... of the collapse a note here because Nick and preparing this is exhausting and his details and ironies are everywhere when you're dealing with the map of Europe\nOr the Germans are assessing where they have replacements to hold the line together because some companies are down to Fifteen men some division of Italians are routinely in half and they're not all well\nThe flu is coursing through both ... both armies but the Germans who are not being fed properly of course they're more pray because their immune systems are collapsing\nThere is no penicillin remembered now this is a catastrophe a hundred years ago but the Germans have twenty four divisions in total not on the western front five in the Ukraine twelve in Romania\nThis is a vast army spread out over an empire at the center of this of course is that they're looking for replacements they talk about the class of Nineteen hundred this is the Russian more minister Heinrich fund ... and six hundred thousand men might be available if we hold on what is the class of Nineteen hundred there\nWell it's it's those people I think that uh born in Nineteen hundred all nice you know known to nice you know well and so cool stay up those not generation is just coming of age where they can be so that they can serve in the middle she they can be can scripted but I think you could point isn't there\nThey are and what we call scraping the barrel is there's very little less than ... no more manpower zoo is left to tap\nThe codes every one after the industry that they can still cause then they start looking at the younger generation coming through and trying to get them into the army as early as possible indeed Pat's calling them up yet really\nBig Kaiser has become strangely to me passive\nEmphasizing his illnesses says arthritis has ruined the Chisholm he's having a nervous breakdown also I Know they didn't have the psychology we do they would have said that he was weary or that he was he was reflecting over the over over German history but is there some sense that his personality has suffered in these days\nWhat according to some accounts to kind of seems to have nervous breakdowns most weeks in the war a\nHe's a very unstable character in that sense and of course as Hynden bug and losing do become more powerful I'm as they get the glory as they begin to Rome things ready from Nineteen sixteen order was Kaiser is is gradually pushed out of the ... he complains that his age that he doesn't really do a lot so he's\nHe has pushed out of it and of course he feels he counts\nReally I'm command lewd and ... and the goal pushed them to as well\nUm he's a very insecure character that he'd security has been with him I think really since he was bullied and so people point today is within the last ... as a kind of a symbol of that insecurity and that sort of fragility of his character\nThe crown prince ... at this point he speaks out something called self purification of the army what does he me\n\nWell I think there's a certain they try and come for themselves that actually that you know the the the test to battle is going to produce it sort of how the race a gym and it's going to get rid of the ... of the week um\nBut of course that's really known since that war battles don't really I'm often the best people get killed the um so we are the crown prince is really engaging in fantasy that sort of fantasy I'm heavily infused with an idea of this sort of messianic mission to the gym and race\nUm the idea that actually this is\nA this is what we won't won't they eat the trials and some of those sort of hardy a gym and race can manage I think it's an indication of how difficult many senior commanders or having trying to internalize what he's going on\nThe a response to Wilson is a my notes says on the twenty first of October the cabinet replies to Wilson\nThe Kaiser at this point you picture him chattering I expect him he's out as chateau or he's at the hotel Brits on IQ this is in spa and sometimes I go back to Berlin to confer with the government\nBut the the Kaiser is no is no strength whatsoever they they send their note and they're looking to stall they're stalling because they're concerned that the Kaiser is going to be forced to abdicate it's it's as if this moment they're struggling with the idea that the Kaiser has to go\nYeah absolutely I mean the Kaiser has made it very clear that he does not think that is necessary and that if he goes he's going to be complete chaos in Germany and then he of course thinks that the army's loyal to him Naomi would not accept him going", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "New York",
