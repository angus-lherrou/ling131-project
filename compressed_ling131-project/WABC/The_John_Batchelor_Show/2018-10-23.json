purchase every single one and check them out\nBut he also wounded a brigadier general in American\nAnd the way this was described by both the Americans and NATO was justice was I was just an Afghan on hacking incident\nThat is not a and a and that is not a military that is committed to the fight or is trying to identify the enemy for both the Afghans and the American people that is basically the response that you expect from a military that sort of check down is just looking to get out\nThese were bodyguard vetted bodyguards for the Afghan ... a police yes and they'd been with that I had a long history or was the shooter somebody new do we know ...\nYou know we're going by what the Afghan officials are saying right now so it's a little spotty but it seems like he was relatively new um but he's somebody who managed to work his way right into the inner circles around ... it's it's surprising because ...\nUm again this is a guy who who survived dozens of us at a fascination attempt through the years if you had to put together a kill list for the Taliban and al ... in southern Afghanistan John he be number one on that list this nobody nobody\nWould have been surprised by the fact they wanted to kill them desperately for years so this is it was surprising about this is the fact that they were successful in getting somebody into his inner coterie they're sort of in the security situation for this meeting to it and have this attack be successful\nThese attacks starting with the attack in Kandahar and now the most recent the attacking Iraq leading to the death of a check soldier these are taking place inside the larger story of the Afghanistan parliamentary elections underway\nWe've talked about that on and off over these last Eighteen years the democracy comes to Afghanistan or Tom you report that the Taliban has declared these elections I guess the work of the devil certainly the work of the u._s. and are they killing people who vote Tom what do we know\nWell John I think it's very important here to walk through with the Taliban is set about these elections for this purpose\nI'm the U.S policy to state policy is to try and get the Afghan tall blond to reconcile with the government and lay down its arms or share power in some sort of political ... power sharing system now\nFor those of watch the have watched the tall blond for years and track everything they say we realized that that sort of absurd goal on the face of it that basically the tall bunny said over and over again we're resurrecting are Islamic EMR of Afghanistan were the only legitimate party in town well these were elections approach the Taliban ratcheted up its rhetoric and at state macher statement after statement\nSaying that basically don't participate in these elections if you have them or if you if you open up your homes or your facility as voting places you can be come under attack and in fact the Taliban has um attack claimed hundreds of tax\nAs the elections were underway it seems like it\nSome effect on the elections it's very difficult to say how much\nBut it the bottom line is that the Taliban rule that this was a religious imperative to go and disrupt these elections that's not the rhetoric or this this this um sort of a statement that you would expect from a group that was looking to politically reconcile\nAnd when you track through the statements job but we noticed was that they were actually being issued by different commissions within the Islamic EMR of Afghanistan or is it being attributed to different\nShadow government bodies within the tall blond and why that's significant is that there's there telegraphing that these are the conditions that are going to rule Afghanistan once the Americans get out and we have our way once again\nIt strikes me because I've been reading a Churchill biography a brand new one from Andrew Roberts it strikes me that the Taliban is beginning to look organized and the way that the IRA looked organized\nTo the British authorities right after World War one\nAs they took on the black in town where the British authorities and as they took the IRA it was part of terrorist organization but also part a shadow government that was in place for the settlement with the with the Brits that produce modern Ireland\nYeah and the ... the difference here is that this there's I don't see any prospect for real settlement um if you go through the sort of Islamic jurisprudence that this ... organization\nRelies upon they're saying that it's the only an Islamic system the way we define it can rule over Afghanistan so even though sharia and different Islamic sort of um\nLanguages pepper throughout the Afghan constitution and of course they call themselves\nIslamic entity with the Taliban is that right or all along is that only our version of Islam and our ... ways can rule over Afghanistan and they're they've been very clear they reject the the Afghan government as illegitimate they reject of course the U.S presidents as illegitimate\nAnd they reject the ... elections and they say that it violates their version of Islam They said these elections and the whole parliamentary process\nIs on Islamic is what they've its way of described it this whole election process is on Islamic that is not an organization that is looking to settle and come to terms and sort of sort of give us the sort of face saving deal on our way out\nJust disconnect in any fashion to the report we had a Taliban and U.S officials meeting in Doha, Qatar earlier in the ...\nWell you know John this is why I brought up the American reaction to this attack and the fact that they're still reticent to say that it was a Taliban and plant the obvious and say the Taliban killed our number one ally in southern Afghanistan and wounded Americans in this attack\nMy point is is that basically the Americans are so desperate to reach a deal with the Taliban they'd even when the Taliban has this major infiltrate or attack\nThey create them of a a significant power back and forth in Kandahar and the top American military command and all that Afghanistan is president when this attack takes place and we don't come out and mealy condemned the Taliban in point the finger at them that tells you were not committed to identify the enemy let alone to feeding them\nAnd therefore the negotiations are of false false ... of of a false signal were not sincere and our negotiations they are not sincere and there's and subsequent headlines can be ignored is that is that a conclusion we can draw your ...\nOh I I think worse than the around our negotiations were sincerely week the point is that were just desperate to get any sort of face saving deal we can get they know that and they're looking to do what they've done in the past which has extract concessions string us out and basically humiliate our Afghan allies that's what they've done in the past ... years there have to go ... and that's certainly the game plan that they're using this\nTime does the Taliban in any way indicate that they that the Taliban believes in all of it at a ration believes that ice ... leaving in the new year did they indicate that did they tell their people that does does al ... tell the Taliban\nWell kite as predicted a since the election of President Trump\nThat this is what kind of said directly they said that the America First policy meant that America was going to retreat from Afghanistan and this is the beginning of the end for their superpower status just as it was for the Soviets that's what they've said all along and the Taliban has somewhat more mixed rhetoric on that they want to highlight for example with these past elections\nThey tried to say that this is trying to justify prolong the ... the presence of the foreigners here in Afghanistan which is sort of the rhetoric they're using but I think there are other indications they know that we are certainly looking to head for the doors\nJohnson Johnson of the foundation for the defense of democracy reporting on the news the fresh news\nOf more killings of ice ... personnel by the Taliban and more threats to the those who vote

J. all the great for the great lakes my colleague in caused and\nWe're joined by Gordon Chang our colleague to comment on incident in the Taiwan Strait within these last days US Navy sail to guided missile warships through the Strait of Taiwan\nTaipei ministry of defense describe this as a routine passage to international waters nothing routine when you add the U.S navy warships in presence USS Curtis Wilbur D D G fifty four and USS\nAnd teach them CGI fifty four conducted according to the U.S military website military times a routine Taiwan Strait transit October twenty second in accordance with international law that yesterday their time 'cause it's tomorrow now twenty third\nShift trends it's where the Taiwan straits demonstrates the U.S commitment to a free and open Indo Pacific\nUs naval continue to fly stale and operate anywhere in international law allows this is us Pacific Fleet commenting Gordon this follows a report last week that B. fifty twos I Believe to be fifty two flew over the south China Sea which is open water\nAnd this follows repeated reports of the Chinese a PR the People's Republic of China China flying a nuclear capable bombers clockwise and counterclockwise around Taiwan\nHow do you measure is there a change in Tempe ... Gordon we moved from the Decatur in the south China Sea to the Curtis Wilbur and the ... and the ... the Taiwan straits is there an escalation cycle going on between the U.S navy and the the L A navy good evening to you garden\nA good evening on it that is ... and yes I Do think that there's been an increase in the temple\nAnd of course this comes at a time where they're all sorts of questions about the U.S China relationship in general\nWe're seeing a deterioration in a number of different areas which is a good thing John because the United states now is not socialist at a survey Jane\nRowse initially telling them we're not afraid of them any more that we're just going to do what we want to do and we're not going to take into account their concerns and that is a change for decades of policy which unfortunately but for decades hasn't worked\nThe Decatur incident that was the near collisions the challenge by the Chinese commander which you have described as directed by Xi Jinping himself\nIn this incident with the Curtis Wilbur and the anti them we're told the Chinese shadow them and the Taiwan Strait does that mean that the Chinese backed off or is the Taiwan Strait significantly different in their minds from the desperately islands\nWell I think that is certainly an ... in China's mind Taiwan Strait is different because they really do view it as close to home because they believe that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic they don't really view of the Taiwan Strait as international water\n... they don't even think the south China Sea of international water but the south China Sea and the ... are a lot farther from homeland China than a Taiwan and Taiwan Strait so\nWhat is different um you know they were just shadowing the two warships um they they don't I think we're going to really I don't think that we're going to really try anything so they normally shadow freedom of navigation operations and they did so this time\nThat is a garden what has been the response of other nations in the area to this type of escalation well\nThat if this is a really important question us because it's not just the United states you know we're seeing Britain and France and we're seeing Australia also chip into these uh operations in coastal waters\nAnd that's important so they're trying to understand that it is irritating not just Washington but everybody so they can understand that a coalition is forming against them but certainly they can't stand up to the coalition that's a really good story that is being given to the Chinese not just by us but by a lot of other countries as well\nPuzzle then garden are watching this escalation if we if it is or this a tit for tat was going on where's it going what what's the endgame here are clearly both navies are have lots of resources\nYou know there's a lot of resources here and and we could see more freedom of navigation operations more transit through the international straits\nI think the game is essentially we are going to see either a formal or a de facto agreement to protect Taiwan against Chinese attack\nYou know we have 'em all sorts of things we've got three communiques which are weak we've got to fix the shore and says from the Reagan Administration which were better at the Taiwan Relations Act of Nineteen Seventy nine um but this is actually moving to a point where there's going to essentially be an alliance between Taipei in Washington that's\nThat's important for us to do to sell the Chinese look you know you can say whatever whatever you want but you cannot cross the line because the U.S navy air force\nUm the army we're all going to be there and we are going to defend Taiwan\nThan it sends a very important message again to the other nations in the area doesn't among us resolve and our willingness to help an ally\nOh for sure for sure you know we've allowed the military balance of power across the street to actually\nA road in China's favor and that's something that we said that we wouldn't do but over the course of decades we've allowed that much more robust response that we're seeing in the Trump Administration is important because it I think it helps keep the peace\nWe had been far too ambiguous about our commitments Taiwan I'd like to see the Trump Administration make it very clear I'd like to see the president actually go to Taiwan\nAnd send that symbolic message to Beijing that we are friends and allies with Taiwan and we will never let it go\nThe Russian and Chinese and us defense ministers involved than wandering around negotiating with

J. R. quarter chai like cause the Daily Beast and we're joined by Claudia Rosales riding most\nRecently at the Dallas News about dependence luck Korea caught at Twenty one months ago President Obama handed a failure to President Trump how how do you measure Twenty one months later President Trump's handling of the failure good evening to\nGood evening John Twenty one months later it is at least we're we've shifted a few of the horrendous constraints that applied a are we out of the mud out of the ... is a ...\nUm no we don't know where it's going but some things are being ... and\nGiven that it was a complete disaster Twenty one months ago or there's some chance of seeing perhaps the way to maneuver out of this Gordon\nQuota I think that you're right that ah we're there is a possibility of a good solution but there's also the possibility of one of the greatest tobacco's on American foreign policy because you have President Trump allowing Moon Jae in the south Korean president who's very pro North Korea\nTo do a number of things which are undermining not only American efforts to to nuclear as North Korea but also issues are too he's undermining democracy and actually paving the way for North Korea to take over the south I'm not saying that's going to happen but there's a real possibility of that occur and\nHow do you measure it you're Korean diplomacy right now in an age of Trump\nIt's a disaster on the other hand I don't know that I chalk that up to Trump\nI'm at the problem is that Moon Jae in with democratically elected by South Korea which has raised a generation that really doesn't pay a lot of attention to the serious problems of of the north to the real real threat I mean look the south Korea has\nSet up amusement park years ago along the demilitarized zone not really a wise idea okay and how you're absolutely right that inter Korean diplomacy is incredibly worrying South Korea has a president who seems to be trying to hand over the Democratic thriving south to the north\nThe problem being apart from the humanitarian disaster that that would be a it would be a very bad thing for Kim Jong noon to get his hands on the enormous treasure trove that at South Korea all that technology and loot and people are but as far as\nHow the U.S is able to maneuver given that we can't really ... they're probably limits to what we can dictate to the south Korean president um I think I there's been says a lot going on that's very hard to read you know what does it mean when president can meet\nA president can rise when President Trump meets Kim Jong moon and they they're back and sort of back slapping glad handing in Singapore and then President Trump comes out and says I you know we fell in love he wrote me beautiful letters I take that actually is a form of president of President Trump's\nHumor which depresses inclined to take a little bit to literally but are there are a lot of things going on that are alarming and some of them are pretty strange but if you look at the bigger picture ah the things that America is able to do something about beyond the peninsula\nA there is motion and that includes a lot more pressure on China that includes pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal which means Iran is no longer swimming in the ready cash that it almost certainly was going to be spending on North Korean military where's\nUm there's greater pressure as far as stronger sanctions I've never thought that sanctions could actually and the north Korean nuclear program but they at least they're cutting off some of him as resources and\nAnd over the question and I don't think we really have the answer but the question is what's the endgame here\nAnd that what I was writing the argument that I've been putting forward for a long time is there is no solution to the threat from North Korea that does not that unless there is an end to the regime we're not going to negotiate something so the question is with all these chess pieces moving\nWhere is this going\nAt least we're sort of we pulled out of the the death trajectory that was going on under President Obama the strategic patience that was a blitz of North Korean missile and nuclear tests and threats\nUm and the my the question I was trying to raise is simply is there any\nSame here that might be leading toward the end of the collapse of the north Korean regime an end to that regime without the U.S having to actually go to war\nThaddeus history Claudia ... as you mentioned your piece\nMain may know the regime in Pyongyang understands what happened to die if you don't play that on their media to remind featured do yeah they they know that the endgame is for them to go on the skin of history mirrors aware of that as we are correct correct\nAbsolutely and I you know Ken wants to stay in power he's part of the regime that has been remarkably adept at the north Korea has been\nOfficially in existence for Seventy years now three generations of a totalitarian state than us repressive on the planet and\nUh but once again the question is where does this go and\nA deed what do we do about it the problem is they becoming ever more dangerous\nAnd I did decades at this point a diplomatic deals have failed I Would put no trust at all in the idea that Kim as simply going to say Oh yes I've been offered a wonderful bright future by the Trump Administration if I just completely denuclearize\nI don't think that might punt secretary of state ... belief that where it's going to go I don't think that's where John Bolton believes it's going to go if you look\nThis period of Trump's sort of over the top diplomacy began just about the time that he brought in\nA tune into the current positions secretary of state Pompeo and secure national security adviser John Bolton to men who are specifically on record saying you're not going to get a successful deal at this regime the ... the problem is the regime you know you can't cut a

aircraft carriers that President Trump than last November to exercise jointly up north Korea that is not the firepower three aircraft carriers\nOlive never exercise together you don't need that much

washable enjoyable to trust me if you bet it's uncomfortable do spend your money on a new one on my pillow much suffering\nSaid that right now for you are WABC listeners gets thirty percent off all knew my pillow mattress topper into standard my pillows in one great bundle but none of my fellow dot com today and use the phone call WABC nuts my pillow dot com after nine [noise]\nWas just not a good idea for Democrats if they want it to win the house and have an outside shot at winning the Senate\nBut when you and I just got back from from Michigan and Montana and and and I'm headed out of the road again tomorrow\nDemocrats and Republicans for that matter out in the country that are running for office are not talking about all the things\nLet's say that we're talking about that can get them into trouble\nBut the Democrats in particular for a few weeks there were held hostage\nTo their liberal base on the activist groups that run these national operation what we're pushing the horrible thing and they were held hostage to the Democrats in the Senate that were running with this operation will be pushed by these a liberal groups the\nCandidates themselves never stopped talking about the main issues that they've been talking about from day one and if you're a Democrat that means health care that means your version of the economy and and your version of national security and how you deal with allies and trade and all that so I think\nDemocratic candidates are still doing what they need to be doing but for a while they were were held hostage to what the national party was doing I still think that the arranged for Democrats\nIs you know are around twenty five to thirty seats but there is now much there is now less of a chance that they will get there and so I see more of a chance of Republicans hanging on with a very narrow majority then before capital\nAnd the forty seven percent for President Trump is that a surprise to the Democrats\nWell I look I think we've seen these things go back and forth I I think that probably privately there there might be a little bit surprised on a little bit surprised but not necessarily because you know for about three weeks there\nYou have the Democrats making a spectacle of themselves almost the way they would accuse Trump of making a spectacle themselves and their right he often makes its back on himself Trump's for several weeks had little to say on Twitter only last week that he's sort of get back to dean himself which was the biggest break the Democrats\nHave caught in a while so it'll be interesting to see where Trump's approval or falling a later this week and next week\nUm what they that's why they themselves know favor because all of a sudden they became that which they said they were running to stop\nThat is a general and one of the messaging messages as the Democrats are running on collectively I think is about health care especially preexisting conditions have did you have such huge peas crop of candidates come up with any counter messaging on that a president jot\nA milk out David you go first go ahead\nI'm Sorry about that look I Will just say this is really interesting to me because we saw Democrats lose a thousand seats that are basically over to mid term elections because in part because of the\nUnpopularity of Obamacare and all of a sudden with President Obama out of office\nAnd Republicans in a position to actually do something about healthcare they're now on the defensive and Democrats have done a really good job of putting them on the defensive on these two tenets of Obamacare which are free ... lifetime caps\nAnd some Republicans that I interviewed on the trail uh really straight about it close federal mandate to protect preexisting conditions lifetime caps they they do this through other means but they don't want the government\nTo protect it on the other is just kinda fumble over their word and finally got around telling me well yeah I I Believe in these two parts of Obamacare\nSo I think you you you took your hand of the Democrats here and that they got the better part of this is\nJohn I was talking to a meeting\nToday we're Nancy Pelosi was speaking and she said this election was about health care\nAnd they ... up through strongest suit bill the last thing they want it to be is about the economy which is doing well it was the last thing they want it to be is about a national security\nAnd the last thing they want it to be is about the tax cuts although they still make arguments about benefiting the rich the Democrats are running a micro decentralized campaign around the country largely successful in many districts but\nIn the districts where the Republicans are most in trouble I see Republican after Republican incumbent doing with David says they're just roll over and agree with the Democratic so while the Democrats have a good issue where they need to gain seats the Republicans are agreeing with them\nWe have a GDP number estimate for the third quarter coming next week a David I start with you that that promises to be in the neighborhood and I'm quoting Steve more here in the ... which is the Laffer curve seem more in the neighborhood of ... percent is that already built in to the argument or is that going to boost things that\nI think it's built into the argument in fact I think it's really a better argument for President Trump is twenty twenty that it is for Republican wanting Eighteen\nAnd look by All right with an economy like this Republican should be in a much better position than the only reason they're looking slightly better than they were and it's only slightly\nBecause the Democrats formal the ball with Brett Kavanaugh I think that that the problem for Republicans with the tax overhaul is that you look at the polling are on it and on balance people disapprove of it\nIt may not make any sense but they get a horrible job selling it and you have some key districts where the elimination of state and local tax deduction solved\nIs still a problem and so I just think that is good at this you know might have been for the economy and and I'm not arguing that in fact voters have not connected the dots I think that it's the kind of ... that that they can and that in a twenty twenty reelection for Trump but it's not happening in this election\nJohn GDP [noise] I I think that's\nSort of amorphous number that people don't really follow what they follow is if my job secure am I worried about losing it and that's my take home pay going up in the last year\nUm there's a mixed bag out there because we've been stagnant wages for over a decade but I think in some key districts especially where I'm you know the companies are hiring again and and the wage increase the wage is because of tight labor market conditions\nIn a few key districts the Republicans are being helped by the economy of those are precisely the district suburban districts in the\nMid west of the south that they have to hold to keep the house\nDavid and John both national national security so when we come back we'll go to national security and that means the care of that\nWhich at this point

Thaddeus McCotter my colleague can cause W. J. R. and we welcome alcohol line\nConference of presidents major American Jewish organizations there was an overwhelming amount of news from\nThe middle east may began with a report that Jordan plans to revoke parts of the peace treaty with Israel Malcolm I don't know how to interpret this what is driving us spoken most warmly of King Abdullah the second these many years more than a decade now what is this\n[noise] this is very disturbing and a good evening to both of you it it's um it's a story still in the making and it caught or people in Israel I think in Jordan as well as in the United states by surprise\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when they signed the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel and I was privileged to go there with President Clinton at the time to the Arab out to the desert to to witness the signing was very emotional very celebratory\nHim one of the clauses in this ... agreement dealt with two pieces of property one in the north called cholera or in Hebrew not Ryan and won it in the south about a hundred and thirty kilometers north of the um\n[noise] a lot and you're a ... a that was called so far in Hebrew a hammer in a in Jordan at this was these were Lance uh they have somewhat of a different status or each from the other one the one of the south was um it rather than the north\nWas an area that had a had a a hydroelectric plant built in the Nineteen twenties by Jewish farmer Jewish businessman who bought much of the land\nAnd when the agreement was signed um Israel and Jordan in the spirit of friendship\nAgreed that farmers from Israel could continue to plow the land and produced on it but the sovereignty would return to\nJordan and in the middle of it is this island the peace where the hydroelectric plant than a which had been dedicated by the king\nAnd there's also a memorial nearby to seven young girls from an Israeli school who were mowed down by Jordanian soldier that six more were wounded and if you remember the lake king was same paid a visit to the families\nIn a very moving a and a sign of humility are asking them for forgiveness\nThe second place in the southern place are so far or is there is a bit larger and there again the farmers who are dependent upon this for their income they're about fifty farming families ah would lose I don't know two hundred and fifty acres or so\nUh but it will be very important to them and the green that that was signed said that it was to last for twenty five years but one year before\nAnd that one year anniversary is this week either side could get noticed that they want to re examine or\nAbout exiting or the agreement Jordan exercise that and notified Israel it seems\nOnly with the public announcement made in Jordan or that they did not attend to renew the agreement when it ends a year from now\nAh and the agreement says that either side making that announcement would then engage in negotiations in Jordan and saying now they won't engage in any kind of negotiations it's not clear whether\nKing of the other was upset because he was left out of the ... the Jerusalem negotiations that other recent events\nAnd may have prompted it but most of all the domestic demand and this is being celebrated in Jordan and he had received a a petition on many issues but the only one affecting Israel related to this agreement asking that it not be renewed\nSo I guess we'll learn more but the you know this is a very valuable to terms of the the Israeli farmers and family it's been very peaceful they cooperated a manager Danny it's work there and I think it's a very regretful that has moved in this direction\nThat is somewhat max Malcolm how to how does this parent breach become a healed\nA very good question and I don't have a good answer because if the if you're a dancer simply saying we're not going to negotiate\nA it could be grandstanding could be you know a chance for the king to show its constituency that it's been tough and then during the course of the year they work out some sort of an understanding\nA right now I don't know what the shape of that could be there are a lot of possibilities because there's heavy investment by the Israeli farmers there there's a lot of money that they put into this over the last Twenty years\nAnd the um important the symbolic importance as well as the economic importance are not gonna sit well with the Israeli people certainly not going to help the atmosphere and this you know Israel is very critical to the security of Jordan and Jordan's security is critical to Israel they've said so many times and they have\nExercise it in many more ways than that it's made public so\nYou know the stakes are high but I think that the two sides can find some sort of a compromise\nWould enable the the agreement to somehow stay in force and maybe Jordan have some say saving additional role or sovereignty the expression\nAs we approached in November for severe sanctions on Iran puzzle\nWe mentioned that is now confirmed by intelligence sources there and here that Iran is upgrading the rockets that has the law are we looking at a cataclysm hear Malcolm Jordan and his ally everything on November

lawyers first of all that's\nThat's a very strange thing to to treat adults that way but the other thing is look at the incentives the the company has absolutely no reason to say yes they have every reason to say no and um and and that's not an empowering ... in a position for adults to be in\nWhat's upon a time and I know there's only on a totally also it was a company policy at CBS News that a husband and wife cannot work together cannot work in the company together and\nThere was a movie made about Edward are ... but it included a wonderful turn of the husband and wife denying that they

genetics or what or to teach the millennials in your generation ago\nYou know I read about this also for the wall Street Journal and one of the things they said there was that one of the things that teaches you is that if you have an awkward event with someone hold onto it until they seek a position of power um and then and then you could really use it on ... it's it's a very it was a very strange thing um\nSo the whole notion of believe all women it's a very sad strange idea because you know it it it's still for pasta it till preposterous on its face but it's it's very sad than any woman would would sign up for that you know to me to sort of pledged to believe other women on as if it's some sort of faith group\nAnd you know ... and ... and it's really it's it's beneath when they

J. are the great for the great lakes and\nAlways happy to be joined by our colleague Andrew McCarthy especially on Rod Rosenstein waiting there is new that Rod Rosenstein will appear under oath\nTo members of the Congress in the next days and what he will say is significant because he's in charge of Russia gate he's the boss mother is not even really a real attorney he works for a mother\nA well he works for Rosa state Mohler only does what Rosa St wants him to do and so in talking to residents saying we're actually talking to the thing itself\nAnd you have very good evening to you I Want to concentrate on this because we've been dealing with Rod Rosenstein is if he was a wallflower\nOr just without a backbone or a man who can't find your shoes in fact he's the boss and having gone through the facts of may twenty Seventeen when in a matter of nine or ten days he changed his life by panicking\nAnd spinning around in a room I figure he was like being a ... a victim of extra system since ... may have twenty Seventeen he's become more and more the story so let's begin with the Rosen steam power Rod Rosenstein gene\nDirects Miller Miller is going to a report to Rod Rosenstein maybe we don't have to see any of this maybe only the indictments wherever whatever we'll see I learn from you but you noted in your conversation with rich Lowry on your excellent podcast I recommend to everybody at National Review online\nThat there was a Bloomberg report last week\nThat motorists getting to wrap it up does that mean Rosen's teen can direct Muller finished this get it done report to me what does it mean wrap it up good even to Andy\nGood evening John well it's always been true that Rosenstein could\nExercise authority over Mahler because he uh in the pecking order he is not only the the\nOfficial who named Mueller as special counsel the is the uh he's the deputy attorney general he's also the official in the chain of command that Muller answers to the reason we thought of him\nJohn as a wallflower is really more out of Mr Rosenstein his own mouth than anything else as soon as he appointed\nMahler that very day\nHe had a meeting with a top Democrats on Capitol Hill in which he promised them that there would be no interference in bowlers investigation that he would be permitted a basically to do whatever he shows in terms of ah you know chasing facts down to wherever they\nLead and he was given this wide mandate to investigate without the predicate of a a a normal criminal investigation\nSo he has given mall are a very wide berth or the latest reports indicate that uh\nHe being under pressure I Believe from uh the White House\nThat is the Rosenstein being under pressure from the White House or because of a number of things not\nLeast of the fact the revelations that Rosen steam or ... ... at one point\nOr talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment against President Trump talked about secretly recording President Trump and the White House clearly as a a a ... as kind of a a ballast for twenty Fifth Amendment plan that the that the president might not be\nA mentally up to the job or that obviously is a not looked upon a with great fondness by the White House so I think they have blamed on Rosenstein is starting to get this over with and Rosenstein the reporting it Blumberg indicates\nA hasn't turned leaned on smaller meanwhile it has looked like mall are has been has been at least ostensibly doing things that would be consistent with winding down an investigation ... such as staffing down\nOr transferring some of the investigations the indictments that he's brought to other components of the Justice Department\nSo it looks like we could be wanting to an end but\nI'm not holding my breath quite yet that is\nWhat are the possibilities that may have for further shall we say X or a sugar burgers special counsel\n[noise] well I think a daddy is that while Moore has stepped down as I have often pointed out uh I did a big terrorism\nCase in the Nineteen nineties with a grand total of three lawyers me and a two other guys Mahler still even with the down staffing\nA has a I I think fourteen Thirteen or fourteen lawyers on staff which is a very large staff and they're obviously continuing to work different investigate and the angles they are still negotiating as we understand that over the terms\nOf a President Trump's\nSit down interview by the special counsel including whether that interview Wil happen at all and if it doesn't happen whether a mall or would take the step of are issuing a subpoena which would be very controversial and would lead to a lot of litigation we hear that there were also pursuing a\nSome other angles involving you know potentially contacts between a wiki leaks\nAnd Roger Stone who was a ... a friend and associate of the president's but not somebody who formerly had a role in the president's campaign so there were still odds and ends there that are slowly being looked at\nYour total rich Lowry that Mueller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however what I take from that remark is that we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV\nWhat we're going to get is either no indictment or indictments we've had some documents of Russians cheaply and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign you believe it's significant however\nI'm John ... so this is the John bachelor show Thaddeus McCotter and I are having a conversation with Andrew McCarthy of the national Review Online about what we're told will be rod\nRosenstein the deputy attorney general testimony to Congress under oath and it's a select group of Congress\nIt's not a huge committee I think it's too from each side or free from each side\nWhat he will say about events of these last weeks he also has a for the first time to my knowledge going on a PR campaign to puff up the department of justice's works for Russia gate these last\nEighteen months by calling it and this is a quote from the wall Street Journal the ... the Russia investigation appropriate and independent\nAny when a department of justice figure comes out and talks to the press it tells me they want something what's he want with is is this is this promoting himself as a politician is is to make Hollywood interests how how does this work for\n[noise] well I think John ... and what I'm fearful of is that what we're seeing is the outlines of how this ah whole episode is going to be brought\nTo an end and I think that what you what you're starting to see our the outlines of a a kind of a comet date of deal\nIn which there were probably no\nCharges or impeachable offenses sided against a President Trump in the mall or investigation and at the same time\nThough what ends up getting soft pedaled is the a Justice Department and FBI's investigative tactics in connection with the Trump campaign in the run up to the twenty sixteen election and the first months of the Trump Administration uh\nI I think that this is the way that this is teeing up and it's interesting that\nRosenstein would be a guy who is going to have this conversation with a very select group as you say are not the full committee but very select group of uh of of high ranking members of Congress who've been looking at this\nUh I I think that's where we're headed and Rosenstein is the guy who can you speak to both ends of\nThe investigation both the investigation of the Trump campaign and the more investigation that is\n[noise] well it would be unfortunate end it because we've seen evidence on the side of people using their power walk [noise] are investigating the Trump campaign and trying to sabotage the trucks transition but we've not seen any evidence or Russian collusion by the Trump campaign or by the president himself\nA Rosenstein does he not have a rare for large steak and that outcome because of the things he did criticizing the eyes of war and\nYeah I ... I think so yeah and I think what they'll end up saying that he is is that while the president's ah himself did not take any a suspicious actions and a ... you know while he hasn't done anything a criminal or actionable\nOr he did bring into his campaign these people who had significant connections to Kremlin tied\nPeople and I think that's the way they'll uh pictured which gave the Justice Department and the FBI or a good rationale to be suspicious and to take investigative action I'm not saying I agree with those\nI just I I've been I've been thinking for a long while a that this is the way that we are headed and I just think it's very very curious to me two things number one\nThat President Trump first announced and then did a one eighty on whether he was going to\nAuthorize the public disclosure of ah documents that these congressional committees have been pressing for so he was going to give them you're going to give us we were going to be able to see what was in those documents Congress who's going to\nBe able to see it and then suddenly he changed his mind about that a ... and you combine that with by this John pointed out the sudden appearance of um of of Rosenstein publicly\nUh the justification sees a now publicly offering up for the investigation and I see but maybe this is just my ah being a cynic maybe this is my old prosecutor antennae the ... of paying\nA could be any number of things I suppose but I see the outlines of a potential deal here\nTo deal with Rosenstein Andy\nRosenstein ... author the Mueller investigation he's written those two letter for letter in the second letter August\nHe has a lot of explaining to do if he's to stay on and the Trump Administration after the elections a lot of explaining because the party the Republican Party sees this as a politicized damage the whole thing as electioneering\nThe whole thing is a narrative to satisfy the Clintons in December of twenty sixteen and then to drive fund raising and programming for MSNBC and CNN for Eighteen months now ... responsible for all that he signed the forest fire someone\nHe has no future in the Trump Administration so with Rosie out of there do we get to ... when we get to see all those documents because he went to my reading he's the only thing blocking us right now\nWe when we get to see all those documents were going to have a lot more to say then gee fell as we were wrong\nI don't know John I I Wish that I thought that was necessarily true but you know I don't see Rosenstein is the only\nStumbling block here there's never been a moment than we've observed is several times in the last couple of years are discussing this and analyzing it there's never been a moment when president and President Trump hasn't had the authority or to\nDisclose all of this information and yet he hasn't um I'm not sure that Rosenstein doesn't have a future in the administration you wouldn't think so but\nUh you know the president speaks well of him he speaks well of the president when he's a when he's speaking publicly\nThe Republicans even if things go well on election night are going to have a very thin margin at best or in the Senate so it won't be the easiest thing to replace Rosenstein or if he's fired and I just don't think I'm correct that the Republicans are unified\nIn in believing that the investigation of the Trump campaign was politicized I think that there's a lot of feeling particularly in the Senate we heard a lot of it in the Senate intelligence committee\nOr that there were very good reasons to proceed with this investigation and there'd been a number of prominent Republicans including Marco Rubio I'm\n... and and uh Trey Gowdy two to name to a who seemed to be very sympathetic to the FBI surveillance of Carter Page\nSo I'm not sure it's a it's a unified Republican front on this\nAnd that's another reason why I think we could be just seeing the beginning of the end where it turns out that there is no charges fraud or any actionable information brought against 'em out against President Trump\nThat they decide that the um even if there was some excessive um the tactics used in the investigation that that wall when all was on the up and up\nAnd everybody um walks away\nA kind of reminds me if I May of the of the nine eleven commission which you know started out\nA a sign of a partisan ball and then at a certain point um when everybody kind of realized that both the Clinton than the Bush administration could be harmed by this uh suddenly there was a\nPiece at our time there was a report that we should that didn't blame either the Clinton Administration or the Bush administration or nine eleven they hung the you know the FBI the CIA out to dry but you know the politicians pretty much emerged unscathed and everybody looked to fight another day\nAnd they're about ... the national Review Online Thaddeus McCotter W.
