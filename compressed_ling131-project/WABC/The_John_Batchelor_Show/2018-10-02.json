two year old Joshua Stewart\nTrained with and fought alongside economies men in Afghanistan and right up from the Knight ... from the late Nineteen eighties all the way to the today how ... terrain around the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan is still infested with al ... because the economy's have never ever broken from a guide and they never will\nAnd jaw and an economy may be dead but his son ... who is\nReally sort of cut from the same clauses father does every indication that he is still ... to this day now why is that important John well ... the number two in the towel bought he is the warlord the show gone to the tall blond and its military operations in Afghanistan and that and he is an al ... which should tell you something about\nThe ... relationship with al ... and the economy's sort of key role in connecting all these characters together\nCharlie Wilson Charlie Wilson has a movie played by Tom Hanks so that certainly makes him a significant member of Congress\nHowever Charlie Wilson's park with a ... network is is right in front of us were looking at it all the time and you note so quickly how does Charlie Wilson how does the CIA how does the way we fought the Soviets uh continue today right in front of us\nWell you know of course if you go back to Charlie Wilson's war of the movie or the book the book is is very good at laying out the relationship between Charlie Wilson enjoy all of the county\nI'm Charlie Wilson this congressman from Texas who pull all these lovers to make this sort of a job in Afghanistan work he was very much I'm Fonda jaw and in a ... to the point where he actually called ... goodness personified is the way he referred to him\nNow of course the title of my pieces bad news personified because it turns out that economy was the exact opposite of what Charlie Wilson thought he was\nUm an economy so cutting out a very close relationship with Wilson will see even visited um Afghanistan Pakistan under the protection of the counties and at one point there is a very um in his book by Milton beer bearded and James rising called the main enemy which recounts sort of the CIA is war against the Soviets\n... one of the anecdotes in that book um is about how ... and his men took old tires and chains and they were raking in across the dirt road trying to kick up dust clouds\nThey were trying to attract the attention of a Soviet fighter or helicopter why they because they Charlie Wilson wanted a shoe one down himself with a stinger missile\nAnd so the shows you how closely um ... he was working with walls and how close relationship between those two that basically this US Congressman was in bed with this legendary and now notorious mujahedeen commander who in ...\nIt all ... and it shows you sort of the unintended consequences of what came out of a war against the Soviets in Afghanistan\nIt occurs to me a bill listening to your story I've just done a new history one volume history of Vietnam\nHow the U.S created the same months during Vietnam that we've created in Pakistan or the intentions that first year to fight the Soviets or to fight the Cold War but what what becomes of our\nOf our clients is the enemy itself and we failed to solve this and so we go through the same cycle again and again what we did with\nAh the see I'm brothers in the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties until John Kennedy approved the assassin um the removal of the GM brothers\nYou can see with the ... network we we ... we ... we endorsed it we we we agra dies did so that the Pakistani ISI was not wrong headed in thinking that it was it had our blessing\nYeah you know basically I look at the story of going to kind of thing in the piece\nAs a warning I think it should be with one of those lessons that still people have not really learned um from all this in fact we've sort of went through a replay of this where you've had especially post Arab Spring the procedure uprisings you've had a number of calls in Washington elsewhere to get behind Sunni extremist or ...\nSome of which are either linked to al ... are kind of groups um because they want to work with them in Syria or they want to work with them in different countries you know some of some people have actually meet outright claims\nThat we should work with these types of groups around the world and I think that is sort of sorely mistaken for a lot of reasons I don't think it makes sense for the United states ever to get in bed with the extremists of any sort to be honest with you people try and make these ... billion calculations to say well we'll work with this one extremist group now and then we'll sort of\nSome of them down the river later but that's not ... you know ... it wasn't a moron you know he wouldn't work with you know people who basically wanted to kill him\nAnd think that that was going to be right at the end of the day and essentially that's what a lot of the foreign policy establishment I'm In Washington has has called for in Syria and elsewhere\nIs the get behind sort of the modern day ... and it doesn't really make any sense when you look at the story of what how this unfolded in Afghanistan Pakistan the fact that we're still living with the consequences of the day we're still living with the consequences of what her ... and his men have done here to this day it really is I think a cautionary tale\nBill a very good evening to we'd go immediately to Somalia which is another twentieth century story where the U.S invested treasure and blood and these many decades later Somalia is a failed state\nYou've reported on the U.S taking action against the al Shabaab in Somalia the vast landscape and most of the action seems to be in the south or why are we launching airstrikes what is our mission in Somalia given that it it's it's a completely failed state\nGood evening John yes so the U.S is trying to counter ... which is al ... is branching eats East Africa it's official branch\nAnd you don't you are correct and most of the the airstrikes in an operation that are in southern and central Somalia but we've seen in the strikes span almost the entire length\nOf the country there's been also been a couple of attacks last year against the Islamic State's NASA branch in Somalia as well so last year there was a total of ah thirty four strikes thirty one of them against Shabaab\nAnd another three against the Islamic state this year there's been twenty three strikes they keep hitting Shabaab window when it's really smelly forces or or the when U.S forces are partnering with Somali forces are African Union forces and operations particularly in the south of most of these operations are in sub out over Mogadishu area where it's out of it\nI'm Still show in the state department issued a country it's got to report on terrorism and it said that Somalia remains quote as terrorists safe haven and quote\nThe year before they similar language was used about ... about the strikes against Shabaab have increased but obviously it's not enough because\nYou know a total of sixty plus strikes over the last two years or just about the strikes in the last two years has not done enough to roll back the Shabaab partnering with yeah with the Somali forces with African African Union forces which are slowly withdrawing the size of the African Union contingent there continues to decrease\nAnd Shabaab ... maintains a terrorist safe haven and\nThat is you know the the the problem here trying to go with you know partnering with the Somali national army partnering with African Union forces\nThey just don't have the staying power they don't have the spread of course the Shabaab possesses and that way Shabaab is maintain a persistent\nInsurgency in the country now people will say well it's just a local insurgency it's not something the U.S should care about except there have been lots that have ... there's been fighters that have gone to Somalia and then go on to other theaters and back\nEven as far flung as Afghanistan I'm fighting in Nigeria and other places\nSo it is part of this or this or if it's a it's a theater in the war against uh archery\nWill speak more of Somalia when we come back bill because the Shabaab is targeting not just American allies are not just Americans but also our allies in Mogadishu the capital\nThis is Black Hawk down for everybody who wants to relate to this through Hollywood this is the episode that introduced us and its military\nInto the costs roads of al ... it happened a long

M. C. A. U.S Mexico Canada announced today in the rose garden the new NAFTA\nA involves agribusiness pharmaceuticals automobiles that does not involve steel and aluminum those terrorists are to be negotiated separately certainly daring in other words and there's and updating two of the old NAFTA including a financial services and cyber\nAllen this deal wasn't happening friday night and there was rationalization and then it's announced are you surprised and what more do you want\nThis is really pretty typical for for trade deals John having them come to a to some conclusion that the eleventh hour and\nEven after work does it say it's it's it's really like a high stakes poker game\nAnd at some point one side or the other decides that it can't afford to do with no deal at all and in this case Canada clearly blinked and it diplomatically speaking that's clearly a triumph for President Trump but\nI worry that when it comes to the manufacturing heart\nOf this new NAFTA it's going to be just as effective as the oath after at providing incentives for bringing manufacturing production in jobs back to the United states and that was supposed to be job one for President Trump when it comes when it when it comes to overhaul and trade policy\nGordon oh Alan ... always the the darkness and the situation I'm trying to hold them the high standards\nYeah OK okay let me show you the light regardless of what one thing about NAFTA two point oh or one point five or whatever you call and what's important here is that this agreement really undercuts the momentum for a candidate China\nFree trade agreement and that I think would have been really bad for the United states in the long term because this is not of course just the trade deal this is also an issue of American security because by the way we do have a fairly long border with the Canadians\nUm so it seems to me that really there were bigger stakes here and also as the United states gets these deals with Mexico Canada the EU we're now starting to present what looks like a United front to Beijing and of all of these countries and and I know a lot of them are not good traders\nBut of all these countries the Chinese are the worst and they're the ones that pose the bigger challenge to the U.S so\nI think that what the Trump Administration did here was perfect um because what if it was it put us in front of a big coalition facing try to ... what do you think\nI think we're a long way from the big coalition because I really don't see anything in this new version of NAFTA\nThat would prevent if not a formal new Canadian Chinese trade agreement to further deepening of Chinese of Chinese Canadian trade ties and I couldn't help but notice\nIn a lot of the press coverage that we got this morning and it could very well been just sour grapes ... but maybe not that many Canadians observers were saying that they felt that they got such rough treatment at the hands of\nPresident Trump that they learned their lesson and they would never again or they would do their very best to make sure that the country never again rely so heavily on a foreign trade partner to absorb so much of their exports\nOh I think the British taking over a French comeback made that necessary\nCome out Alan ... location location\nWe have to remember Kennedy exports a lot of agricultural products\nA lot of raw materials are at All right Leslie with it with us kind of I just never again that is never again never again\nYes the longest peaceful border in the world yeah I can see Canada right now from yeah you can see literally again right and it literally can and I'm not seeing them holding pitchforks and torches yet over this agreement [laughter]\nBut Allen can you can you tell us what some of the some of the changes with Mexico where we know about Canada and you've explained a lot about what about with Mexico\nSure um the the most important changes have to do with the automotive trade and of course automotive trade has been at the heart of North American traded diplomacy a certainly since the previous NAFTA began to be to go shoot it seriously by George H W. Bush\nAnd the big problem I see is that it's going to be just as easy\nUnder this new version of NAFTA for non North American automobile producers to supply North America by exporting to it rather than rather than the by investing in it\nAs it as it was under the old NAFTA and the result of that old NAFTA with exactly what President Trump complained about the United states lost\nMillions of highways manufacturing jobs many of them automotive and clearly last global competitive and clearly last global competitiveness in the critical industry\nA garden and how to Beijing see this deal\nI I think that Beijing's business do as a real issue because they hope to use Canada is wedge a and actually to pry Canada away from the United states\nIt's a little bit more difficult now than it was a twenty four hours ago and that's a very good thing for us because it really means that we are going to keep a strong trade union or a customs area you know Mexico Canada the United states\nYou know I can understand Allen's um points but nonetheless when you start to look at the bigger geo political issues um China must be frightened right\nNow thirty seconds Allen I spoke with Scotland earlier today and the u._k. ... I'm an all the turmoil and Brexit UK wants to deal with Canada right away and they look upon this says good news the U.S deal with Ken\nRight it's it's it's really striking though that that although President Trump clearly sympathize with the more nationalistic impulses that war were behind breaks and the the more sovereignty\nFifteen seconds Allen Fifteen cents every he's never told the Brits\nOnce you're out of that is that the European Union will take care of your trade was never said\nNo he hasn't although\nIt might ... yeah\nAlan titles and garden check that is McCotter I'm Josh\nNormally good and bad bacteria live together and our intestine or poor diet drinking alcohol prescription medication an aging pencil warfare balance affecting immunity and metabolism taking invites true of all pro by addict can help restore your good\nBacteria even very healthy people can suffer with passion is floating in flatulence invites trouble probiotics can help by supporting digestion regularity an\nAppetite control invites non GMO trouble probiotic supplies three thoroughly researched the bacterial strains for adults and children a taste great and it's free of milkweed soy including take advantage of the special offers some insight helped by one bottle of ... retail price risk free I get the second bubble free with free shipping contract invite a\nEight hundred three eight zero four zero nine Seventy three for\n... for eight hundred and eight zero four zero nine seven springs that's eight hundred three eight zero four zero nine seven\nWords you can also visited ... go to invite the more she invites health luxury front of us [noise]\nI think we'd be looking at a different atmosphere than we're looking at and that is one where they House Republicans are a lot of trouble\nUm I've talked to Republican strategist\nWho are very involved in the electric who are were around in oh six you know wait when the Republicans got creamed they were a rounded\nTen and fourteen when Republicans cruised the one a lot of seats and they tell me that the ... a lot like a sick that the the specifics are different the dynamics are different but the feeling of what losing looks like a is what they're seeing\nOn the Senate side Republicans still have a very good chance of not just holding the majority of the gay and a couple of feet and here's where Kavanaugh which the story of all the cuts for a two different ways in the house\nIt's a problem because the map in the house is suburbia and women\nWho don't like the president's Tanner and tone\nAnd have been sort of driving these districts that have warned voted Republican for Congress away from the Republican Party in this election and all of this business for cabinet not helping that maybe it's not going to hurt it any more but it's certainly not going to help that it could make it worse\nIn the Senate though where we've talked before we know we have a lot of red states a lot of states that are just Republican leaning what happened to like the president\nOr this fight as it turned into over the past couple of weeks could jam up Republican enthusiasm and could help Republicans running against the Democratic incumbents or we'll have to see where the dust settles sometimes there's a major event or a member of the um\nAccess Hollywood tape and twenty six day in and then the president you there's no way he can win the dust settled things kind of get back to normal in the race is on the other thing so we'll see how the dust settles but for now looks like it you know it is helping Republicans in the Senate races so that's where things stand\nSaturdays you lived through ... H um before a U turn to David can you come in on the possibility that this is oh six or NATO sex\nWill certainly felt like a six for quite a bit been remembering oh six we started to close the gap and then the Foley issue happened right at the end\nAnd that kind of finish this off at that point in time you also have the economy was not doing well in many of the places where the targets seats such as mine at the time in the Detroit area you could start to feel the effects of the economy slowing down\nAnd people were very upset about that you had Iraq as well so you had war and peace we're not playing well in a lot of the suburban slash targeted districts\nSo I think David's right we need to see where the dust has gone to settle in terms of the house races or it's not going to be a great years we're always disgusted some mid term for first term president but it it's just a question of whether or not it's going to be horrible or whether or not to cut their losses and actually do and respectable job\nThat last month to remind everybody Foley was represented to Florida I Believe and he had concealed his bad acting towards house pages that was revealed and he resigned didn't eat right before the election something like that\nAnd he was gone but at the end it was covering up the bad behavior by the speaker's office and others are saying and so when that became a scandal and rightly so many of us were outraged but we also knew this so would the voters\nAnd we knew that it was going to be here it's indefensible what's the leadership did in that instance and so you just went in there knowing that it was going to be far worse\nAnd then you're in originally probably far even more so than men and women when that came out go do you have a question for David\nDavid in terms of the Senate we you talked about how this can kind of in building enthusiasm and one of those red states with a democratic incumbents are we seeing any type of enthusiasm gap change in the house races\nWell look the initial read on the past few days is that the Republican enthusiasm is up across the board but\nThe issue is that the partisanship and the atmosphere in house races versus Senate races in most of these house races are already in trouble because the voters there are the gun and especially female voters\nOf the gun to make a decision that they want to put a check on Trump\nAnd you're not dealing with the same kind of\nA heart is in conservative reporters and Republican as you may be dealing with an Indiana or West Virginia or or North Dakota and so it's just a different in in what kind of voter you're dealing with an and one thing that if I wanted to add on to that one of the things that reminds me\nOf oh six that that in a lot of these districts I think you're not necessarily find the unhappiness with the Republican incumbent but just the desire that you have no other choice if you want to put a check on Trump but to vote for the Democrat and that's some of the things that I've been seen\nAnd it's what we saw into sex where people would would say in the verbatim to the polling and would say out loud\nI Know you know Congress and so and so he does a great job he's doing a great job for years but I just had enough of Bush and then there's nothing else I can do that's too bad he's got to suffer for it but that's just the way go\nWe're joined by John Fund at the national Review Online Mr fun we have been commenting 'cause Saturdays lived through oh sex when the Republicans lost the majority in the house of representatives and ... he became speaker in two thousand and seven comparing it to the conditions today with a month to go how do you measure of ...\nThe problem is many many areas where the district or actually competitive\nThe problem is Republican low voter turnout and that's why the Kavanaugh situation is so critical it could end up boosting democratic turnout dramatically but also ended up losing Republican turnout dramatically what we do see though is of course Democrats are revved up about with the lecture\nAre they revved up to the places word count\nBecause if you if you're in a democratic district and you have Donald Trump and your vote democratic it doesn't change anything so that's why the cabinet are raised as I did become part of a campaign we're going to be we're going to be voting in large part of the emotions and the issues stirred up Kavanaugh which is a completely unexpected developed\nA fat each have a question for John looks the same time he kind of touched on their yes David earlier John\nAbout are we seeing the Republican enthusiasm applied both in the Senate which team talked about are we seeing it as well in the house districts with the house has to win because as David pointed out their different constellations routers\nRight these are suburban or urban and the districts were for Mrs Clinton and yet have a Republican nominee I Believe they're fifty or fifty five of them John and those are well educated and well money of voters\nWould I Do know is a lot of ... Republicans view Brett Kavanaugh as one of their own kind of that I was married to a crowded Republican\nAnd a lot of them view of the Democratic tactics is just appalling and if that can be combined with the Trump wrote then some of the house yesterday you might be able to drag a few of the house Republican incumbents ... over the line and when a ... Republican still going to have a bad election year\nBut I think Kavanaugh because if the Democrats are ... seats were of overstep the boundaries of decency and politics\nThat could mitigate some of those losses of these suburban seats\nGave a juicy over confidence with the Democrats the Republicans have that as a as a constant tell when they're approaching election over confidence how about the Democrats\nWell I think that for the liberal groups and activists that are focused on the feeding Kavanaugh any way they can\nI think that there may be a bit of over confident that there's no way this can cut against them I mean they they believe in this as a matter of policy\nAnd philosophy so I don't know that they're that concerned about the politics of it but I I don't think they imagine that it could cut against them I Know that democratic strategists that are in charge of healthy to win campaigns are worried about it I've talked to them about it\nAnd they're not worried yet that it's gone a off the rails but they're worried that it could go off the rails I think and I and I know from talking to them many of them I mean I Would hold them and I've talked to a few of them can extrapolate here that many of them would have preferred a quiet Kavanaugh\nConfirmation if they had been up to them so that they could just move on to what is it working for them which is the focus on Trump and everything Trump ride off about a every single ...\nYou've mentioned to me David just quickly here that some very smart democratic ah see her as an empty seat on election day\nYeah yeah some of them here and have you seen a lecture maybe all of a sudden they can be\nA repeat of a a twenty sixteen potentially and it's like you need to show up so that Republicans are in charge of of confirming this seat because the Democrats at this point have been pretty open with the fact that they will walk that they will keep the seat open the same way Republicans kept open the\nTurned out to be the Gorsuch seat and twenty sixteen and they they don't want that to be something that they have to fight over ... they want to be about Trump\nDavid ...

A. you use a product that must be approved by the United States Congress so therefore it is not right now in place\nBut it's perspective is to replace NAFTA\nVeronique diversity of the Mercator centered joins to comment on what we know so far of a ... of the the new deal that replaces after NAFTA\nVery very good evening to you first my thinking here when I heard it late last night is this is brinksmanship you have been very cautious\nAbout the negotiations for some time you've been extremely unhappy with the tariff threats by the Trump Administration from what we know now about the new pack us MCA\nJustice satisfy your concerns about terrorists in the U.S economy and jobs good evening to\nGet anything John I'm yes and no I'm so glad we have a deal I mean I'm so glad it's lifting the uncertainty that investors um had weighing over them that was holding back on their investment in the U.S\nAnd so it's a it's a really good thing we have a deal and it's a very good thing we have a Mexico us Canadian deal that was important so this this is a big relief\nI mean on the terrorists side I mean let's face it I mean we haven't made that much progress because it was already pretty great deal that we had ah with the exception really of Canadian dairy and all us exports we're going\nTo connect Canada and um [noise] and Mexico duty free which is pretty remarkable um so we said a little progress on the Canadian under the leftover Canadian I get\nA imports but unfortunately the metal tariffs are still up and retaliate tore tart tear it from Canada\nAnd Mexico are still up let's say yes and and no and then they'll just say the auto part which is front and center of this deal is you know not great but it's nothing like it could have been a in terms of things that I'm\nAll right I Want to speak to those two aspects first medals or the I'm following the wall Street Journal reporting here us negotiators having sisters and then he changed us duties on steel and aluminum that took effect in June be addressed separately from a broader trader deal among the country's commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nSaid recently an agreement to revise the north American trade pact with allowed negotiators to turn their focus to resolving the steel aluminum standoff so therefore steel and aluminum is the obstacle ahead of us does this give the momentum to resolve that or have\nHave objections raised in these last week's may mean that steel and aluminum is impossible\n[noise] I don't know I Know I mean I've seen headlines suggest that the Canadians we're going to tackle the metal terrorists\nUm after the closing bell so maybe there'll be more on this front to say tomorrow morning I think that an agreement between the U.S Canada and Mexico is honestly opening the door slightly ... a bigger\nTo um to allow a resolution auntie I'm On the medal terrorists it's also worth noting that\nUm the deal this deal I you know as imperfect as it is\nUm some improvement and that let's be honest about this um has I'm also a providing a protection for Canada and Mexico against the upcoming threat of terrorists\nWhich would be quite devastating to to the trade between Canada and Mexico and the U.S\nSo I think\nI think we're making progress we're not there yet but we'll see\nLet's go to the cars are the manufactured um vehicles part of this as I understand it and and the details were not rich but that there's an agreement here to manufacture large parts of the automobiles in Canada and the U.S where the wages are high\nAnd not in Mexico where the wages are not hot you that well and also\nYeah that's and also by the way for like tried to block or created this attempt to have to use parts from um countries where wages are lower than in Mexico um that's not a good thing that increases the cost\nAnd I understand I understand so is this something that did not exist and now after this a portion of a you know so you have your standard Toyota did we divvy it up in this fashion in the old NAFTA or did the old enough to let you make your car where it was cheapest\nWell so um they was a requirement a source requirements for your part and it was sixty percent I'd have to be sourced and the three region and now it is moving to Seventy five percent\nSo um it's not as if there was in terms of source things that we're not there was nothing however there was no a neighbor requirement that I Know of\nEspecially that are so high and putting Mexico such a disadvantage [noise] um\nSo but as far as I Know there was none of that we're really exporting or bad or bad labor laws and and it's even more shocking to the ... that\nIf the Democrats were trying to force these type of labor laws are minimum wage increases on American businesses the Republicans would be serious and rightfully so because they would understand how much distortion that create in the labor market\nThe expectation is that this has to go through Congress next year and the\nA reasonable assumption is that at least part of the Congress will be democratic and so the labor part of the negotiation looks to be a compromise with ... which is that that they can use in Congress so let's move to another part\nWhich is the dairy dairy farmers reports the wall Street Journal got what they asked for it and the new version so the ice cream and milk terrorists that were holding everything up turned out to not be profound I guess that's not a big number but it does make a comeback happy\n[noise]\nKnow got to the John bachelor show [laughter]\nJoined us on those\nProbably my own research\nBecause of the world news and allegations and doubts and excitement leading to the midterm Monica very good evening do\nWe begin immediately with the president's Rose Garden presentation of the new NAFTA U. S. M. C. A. the president was thrilled counsellors behind him were thrilled I was shocked because I thought Canada was slipping away this is a big win for Donald Trump\nI I've puzzled though that our media colleagues did not seem as excited and their questions of the president could even\nDo more [laughter] good evening she joined that is an understatement as the president made this announcement at the rose garden it good for him for doing it in that location because it took about Joe Biden in a different context this was a big bleeping deal this with the promise made by candidate Donald Trump\nEverybody mocked him they said you cannot renegotiate these trade deals whether it's with the e whether it's with China whether it's odd that NAFTA agreement you simply can't do it\nPresident Obama mock tend to dismiss is a proposal saying it it's it's all gone to the ... now globalism is here to stay that says the new normal you cannot\nBring manufacturing jobs back to the u._s. what do you have a magic wand well it turns out that President Trump does not have a magic wand but he does have superb negotiating skills and first chief struck a deal with the Mexican government and then they put the screws to the Canadian government\nJustin Trudeau the prime minister\nYoung dashing a hip and cool\nBut his poll numbers are not very good and he realized that candidate was going to be left out in the cold unless they got to the table\nAnd negotiated with the president said ministry and they came to the table they hammered out this deal and the president ought to be extremely proud\nOf actually getting a replacement in place for NAFTA which put American workers and American taxpayers at a ferry a significant disadvantage for the last what thirty or so years he was able to turn that ship around when everybody else that it couldn't be done\nWe are finished the third quarter we'll get the first estimate of the third quarter growth right before the election the expectation is for it to be four point to which was the second quarter or better\nI spoke with Europe in these last hours Monica we are the envy of the world the European Union is growing up like point for while we're growing it four point plot\nSo the NAFTA deal will only the new NAFTA which is us MCA will only enrich some more I'm not waiting for the president get credit because this is\nSupreme Court week I have an announcement will get credit after the Supreme Court week will have an announcement from Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate today I read the majority leader's remarks\nThat he believes that this is a smear on the good name and family\nOf Brett Kavanaugh he says his good name and his family have been dragged through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on an allegation that lack any corroboration McConnell goes on to say the ... an obstruction has come to a close\nWill be voting this week it look like the Republicans have although slow to this Monica have got themselves organized is the party paying attention\n[noise] finally John yes and in fact I have a column coming tomorrow morning at the hill which has also post on my Facebook and Twitter accounts that talks about not only the Democratic cats a fascination\nA machine gun tactics that they've used on Kavanaugh which they also used on Clarence Thomas which they also used on Robert Bork et cetera but they're they're\nA real full thing hypocrisy and the tripping sanctimonious which they have ... out this process to try to take a Kavanaugh out at the Supreme Court nominee\nAnd I you know it comes to mind when when you hear them a speak\nFrom their their ivory tower purchases on the Senate Judiciary committee about school drinking on the part of Kavanaugh or college drinking on the part of having all the cars these gusting John\nAnd I actually a recount the scene from Nineteen eighty five of us are US Senator from Massachusetts who sixteen years earlier got drunk and actually killed a woman\nSixteen years later he I'm One of his fellow democratic Senator Chris Dodd a waitress on a table and sexually assaulted her I'm speaking of course if Ted Kennedy the lake Kennedy who was lying eyes by the left as a progressive icon and granted a state funeral\nWhen he died but the folks are sitting in judgment of Brett Kavanaugh for having a couple of\nBeers in high school and college you know these people really take the cake John\nThe American people see through it that's why the polling it's starting to move against them particularly those very vulnerable red state Democrats\nYes I Want to know if the ... of the Republicans are waking up Monica because I Would wake up for the news we lead with which was the U.S MCA than new NAFTA deal\nAnd the four percent plus economy that means people are working that means families are stable that means the growth of the United states is restored that's what I wakes me up but apparently that is enough of the Republican Party\nA so the question is is the cabinet character assassination enough for the party to get to the polls or not\nYes now from what I'm saying you know Democrats had it and as soon as he hasn't been the energy gap\nHeading into this whole process right we kept hearing about the right way to come out and vent their frustrations about Trump and the whole truck era but now we're seeing polling comfort coming from Ross my son and some other places that now the G O P has clues that gap\nThere Republican voters and the independents are in just by what they're seeing hearing this transparent political hip job of a very good man\nThere are outraged by it and now that the one problem that Republicans had was a sense of complacency well now I think that Democrats themselves into it because that complacency problem seems to be gone\nDianne Feinstein this is that this is a challenge Monica because she's acting extremely aggressively without explanations making claims making allegations\nAnd also ... feeling or let's put it this way maintaining silence and the questions about how she handled the original allegations from Ford how the letter was handled\nDianne Feinstein I chose to my surprise Monica is now the the the person most in charge of this character assassination in the Democratic party Chuck Schumer seems to have faded into the woodwork business Feinstein's work are you surprised\n[noise] no well\nLook her evolution has been happening over a number of years she used to be she came out of San Francisco of course but she used to be a relatively moderate Senate intelligence committee he used to be somewhat of a voice of a freeze in at a party that was getting increasingly more radical\nOn because the party has gotten more radical she had\nA primary challenge the state Democratic Party in California did not die Kerr until the move against Kavanaugh makes total sense if you put Dianne Feinstein at the age of what is she eighty five\nShe's just she just said either they're right she asked me if\nI if you take and put her in the new context of her party and its political environment it actually does make sense but what a way for Dianne Feinstein complete her political ten year\nHigh but it's interesting a special edition of Monica Crowley we'll speak with Monica later in the week right now the news is that McConnell Senator McConnell in charge of the Senate has said there will be a vote this week lots of time for the Democrats to smear the mole\nI'm John ... this is the John ...

that was that he met with\nEach of these men are together in a Palm Beach at mar a Lago in the spring when he was acting secretary and since then he said quote I've had no connection with them since that\nAre now one of the things that they have tried to influence especially Mr Moskowitz who's a doctor is the electronic health records contract you and I have talked about any number of times\nAnd the disagreements that these three gentlemen had with the previous secretary David Shulkin over a number of different topics was supposed to be one factor in him being fired now nobody's ever confirmed that on the record but there is a discussion among\nBoth the the political people are from the Trump Administration who are still in place it VA folks who have departed and career folks who have both been in are still in and who have left the department of Veterans Affairs but that's the case\nThe connection to mar a Lago deaths in town to beep sound more sounds gossipy however we watched the very carefully because we've had problems that we couldn't have imagined before Francis\nI Believe that the my favorite anecdote is the armed robber who continued to work at the VA because there were no rules against it so\nYou do like to come back to that one at the at at no point in the future we'll let ever not be a great story OK Fox a fair point yeah federal government\nHas work rules and armed robbery isn't part of the conversation so now we go to how Mr Wilkins doing as managing ... an organization this large made up of a lot of veterans in cells in other words a lot of people who work there are patients of their own a constitution\nHow is Wilkie dealing with the turmoil show can and before that the long troubles of the Obama administration has he got an even hand or is he seemed to be an outsider and rookie\nUm I'll get to that if you don't mind in a moment but I Want to make sure that we don't leaves a thread on a on pulled on this mar a Lago group\nNobody has ever alleged ...\nIncluding the people who have talked to from inside the VA that they want anyone to do anything underhanded or to benefit them personally or any of that it's just that they're not accountable to anybody on the house or Senate Veterans' Affairs committee anyone else in Congress\nOr anyone publicly that anybody can tie any particular policy to one of those people and ask him questions about it so I didn't want people thinking that there's some\nThat there are some ... bits conspiring against veterans or anything like that that doesn't appear to be the case it's just there's no transparency no accountability to your question I'm\nA bit about what happens\nUm ... what is happening with secretary Wilkie is he's leading the depart\nRight morale morale I'm keen on morale\nTwo of these wonderful reporters that cover the VA our own government matters on the program tonight Nikki went link from stars and stripes and Leo Shane from the military times\nAnd we joked as we started to record the segment that this would be their last appearance on the program because there's not going to be any more news coming out to be a sin secretary Wilkie told the committee that things are calming down and morale is improving and VA is now a nonpartisan organization\nAnd we joked that their services would no longer be needed on my program since apparently everything's

contractors who build hospitals for a living and they're going to rely on a wisdom from other government organizations like the general services administration and the Army Corps of engineers who built big buildings on a regular basis instead of trying to think it all up on their own that's what really got them into trouble in Denver\nSo that is a partial answer for will be more careful in future we won't run over budget we won't freelance on our own will uh will follow procedures more closely and we'll keep inspired this or is any everybody learned on the road\nI think everybody's

distinguished publications watching now the news from London as the short time\nPresses all parties to have a breakfast deal in place before the end of the European Union as we know it\nSo I'm In a very good morning good evening to you in Scotland uh right now there's lots of gossip coming out of London about the conservatives the Tories having there once a year meeting\nAnd their thrashing about whether they will or will not Brexit the polling says that's the majority are nearly sixty percent of the Tories in parliament one Brexit but there is a an adamant\nMinority that's against all resolution now you are in Edinburgh than I care a great deal about Scotland you know I went to school there for a few years so\nUh what is the end this for Scotland and how if Scotland watching uh the ... the turmoil in other conservatives good evening to\nGetting richer John facts on on the show the the the fantastic thing about breakfast if nothing else it's very entertaining for everybody to watch because they never a dull moment you have Boris Johnson you Michael\nGo if you have Theresa May and the cast of other very colorful characters\nWhat is what is the key sticking point on a lot of what's going on with breakfast for the European Union is the Irish border that if the the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nIt's a it's a very touchy Massa and it dates back to the circle troubles um that were you know it started in the late sixties and went on through the early nineties and it was a horrible period and no one wants to repeat of it [noise]\nSo what scolding just doing now and particularly Nicholas sturgeon who's the first minister of spelled and she will be looking mushy mushy will be looking to see if there's a special deal for Northern Ireland\nSo that it may be sort of neither in the u._k. and went out to the u._k. some sort of something special because if that happens may be scalding can say well if that getting a special deal that has up so half and half out maybe we can have a special off in ... you will because\nScotland is very pro European a much more pro European than say London or the south east of the u._k.\nAnd you're not especially tore in Scotland and for some for many years it was labor dominating the Scottish\nUh districts and then I think the Scottish uh the Scottish national party did very well in the election before last and now you're watching from a distance that's why I'm watching breakfast at Simon I read the headlines from breakfast and they're totally confusing I'm not going to step into that it's hard enough for me to solve NAFTA\nAnd the dealing that were going on here so I'm going to move to a way of watching Brecht said which is to watch the euro currency is ara I a poor but adequate substitute for the the news headlines\nThe euro has been beat up badly and you have a piece of Barron's saying that the ... that at the polling is so bad it might be time or two to bet on the euro why Simon and how do you bet on the euro\nWell it's an interesting story actually one of the things we know and this is all out there is that the U.S is growing really really really well it's booming growth is high unemployment is really really low\nThe European Union the euro area which doesn't include the u._k. but does include Ireland and the other big economies on the continent like Germany and France\nThat economy's been growing quite slowly it's been limping limping along with low inflation and you know a lot of the Mediterranean Countries not doing very well like Italy and Spain\nSo everybody knows this and so they've all sort of bats on on on the Darla I'm taking that money from Europe and I have a flood into the U.S where factories are being built a money invested in the stock market\nAnd here's the thing when every body is bullish on one thing that it's likely to be at a very tall points that it's going to be even as temporarily\nAnd so right now everybody's bullish on the dollar and everybody who's got money that if it bearish on the euro so you could expect things to kind of ... us and and I think it will reverse bats that's how you look at it and how you bet on it if you look at the uh\nThe euro futures markets and or you can also look at the ATF for the euro and you can pass on math\nI mean you can also look at again options so you were going to be I'm going to be circled along the euro's that I Would buy euros or maybe the euro U. T. F. or less experience credit farmed and you can make some money on it you know\nIt is a brutally tricky market to get right because you're up against central banks like bank of England the Federal Reserve and all the rest of that but there is some money to be right that\nUm the euro's now down I Believe is well under one twenty which is shocking to me given that I've travelled in Europe when it's in the one fifty one forty one fifties and the pound has been in the sixties that's been a retreat to\nSo for some time now the European currencies you have in the u._k. both the euro and the pound have been in retreat is that related to Brexit for you I mean it's just a Brexit stories Simon is that why the ... the euro in the pound or so we\nBoth from the pound his weight primarily because of\nBrexit um the u._k. economy hasn't has been vibrant for a long time it has tremendously low unemployment it also has\nBox numbers of immigrants who've come from elsewhere in the European Union because they want to be here now you know you don't come to Scotland for the weather you ... ... it's a lovely here I like it but there's a bit of rain like every half hour\nOr so when people are coming here it's because the economy is great so the the plunging the pounds which was that you know like you say about one Seventy not that long ago it primarily due to breakfast\nI think uh uh from press reports and sources I understand that he came to have a certain amount of trust in Rosen spin and I think that\nIt's it's no longer there and once they found out what a Rosen steam was talking about I think he was a uh I I think his eyes were opened and I believe I'm convinced that once the president you classify these documents being requested by Congress as we hope he does soon\nThat he will be even more aware of the things that we've deputy attorney general or has been up to while working for the president\nRod Rosenstein took his post April twenty six twenty Seventeen and immediately afterwards came lots of turmoil having to do with Russia gate\nThe president had a fire ... fire James Comey because of a memo written by Rod Rosenstein and then soon afterwards Rod Rosenstein makes a decision\nTo hire um a Bob Mueller to run the special investigation rather than an alternative so Rosenstein has been at the center of this whole drama for quite some time does he like in the early is Rosen seem comfortable with having all this pressure\nThere I mean I I I imagine that what he tells them self when he walks into work on Pennsylvania Avenue that whose job is to protect the institution that that he's worked for now for twenty eight years that department of justice\nI'm so I'm looking at in in a way I think that all of your listeners we can all sympathize with somebody wants to\nDo well by an important American institution life that apartment of justice like the Federal Bureau of investigation however the various things as in the OJ\nAnd the FBI did during the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign\nBoth the uh irregularities and abuses regarding the Clinton server investigation and the irregularities unlikely crimes that were committed in the Trump Russia pro\nI think I I think we'd all be more comfortable if you were helping clean up the mess rather than to obscure the different problems that we are going on there so I suspect that he's a that there are a lot of anxious times over there in the jeopardy journey attorney general's office\nThe hiring of Bob Mueller or that has thrown the whole country in this wait and see mode or the president has spoken poorly of malaria spoken partly of Rosenstein is for the spoken poorly of Russia gate at this point you\nMeasure you mentioned those documents you measure that Rosenstein is looking to protect the institution surely he knows that the documents that would be the price of a warrant number four in June of twenty Seventeen that Rod Rosenstein sign\nThat would be a sculptor tore information about Carter Page and that would be the three or two for Bruce or in addition to the president ordered\nThe revelation of all text messaging by the principles that the FBI and the D. O. J. and the twenty sixteen run\nYou measure that rather than seeing is keeping those back not because he's interested in protecting some version of Russia gate but because he's an institutional as well so how does that how does that interpret y Y Z denying us information Y Z denying us information\nNo no not just because he's interested in it not just because he's an institutional is he wants to protect the institution\nBut I Believe he's also protecting an operation here against a candidate Trump\nPresident elect Trump and then later the presidency itself we would like to know we would like to know what the uh you know the the the scope memo that he wrote for Robert mother saying the outline of the investigation most investors redacted we'd like to know what this says ah the fact that\nThe fact that the OJ has pushed back so hard on congressional oversight committees wanting to see what that says I I think it's I think it's fairly significant um this is what\nWe do know is is that the Mueller investigation and this is very important for people to understand I Believe that the Mueller investigation is a continuation of the FBI's investigation that again in January in July to thousands sixteen which was open\nOn the Papadopoulos story which looks more and more bogus by the day\nAs it falls apart as figures like Alexander down or the Australian diplomat\nWalk this back and this is also the investigation in which the FBI use the Clinton funded opposition research to secure a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official\nSo the fact that this same investigation is continuing under the control of Robert Mueller who is being managed by Rod Rosenstein yes this is a serious concern and look there's another there's another document I'd I'd point to and there are other important fact that point you in there\nWhen rose in staying appointed the special counsel\nTo move that investigation from the FBI to the the OJ right he could've just let the deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe who has you know has problems of his own right now\nFacing a grand jury here in Washington D. C. but he moved away from him and put it under his own control this also should tell us something about the a bureaucratic gamesmanship of the deputy attorney general\nThe deputy attorney general was not involved in the original Russia gay scandal of Tony sixteen\nHe did get involved however for that for five so war it is that a a he's not a vulnerability for Rosa ... does he believe it's a vulnerability that he ... a sign that document the documents that we want to see twenty additional now redacted pages from\nRight right yes I think it is on the little among other things that was spying ban on Trump associates or as I point out of peace and would have allowed him it would have allowed the FBI to listen to intercept amount of their communications a very high level officials in the administration at the time\nPerhaps or even likely the president himself lots of very bad thing or the other thing that I point out that when we're asking so what is the redacted information\nWhat are the things that Denver noon as another a congressional leaders I asked to see\nWhat are they telling us that's worse or or at least as bad as the fact that the Steele dossier was the premise of this or that is the premise of the size of one what else is bad in there well Rod Rosenstein signed it whatever it is\nI Would imagine he doesn't want the president and doesn't want a lot of other people seeing it Rod Rosenstein is the name is on that and the question I asked in the article is\nRosenstein is the best that maybe he didn't read the application for the war and so that's one possibility you didn't read as well that would be negligence that it'd be professional professional negligence the other possibility is he did read it and he doesn't want people knowing\nThat he signed off on something very bad that the FBI was doing a regarding President Trump at that point\nRosenstein right now I'm the facing the question being fired or not\nIs he in line to stay on for the rest of the first term or the rest of the term depending on how the election goes in twenty twenty or is he in line to step aside the way many people rotate after the first two years how do you read it yeah\nI I mean the way I see it as right now are especially with the cabinet nomination I mean there's a lot when this White House and there's a lot of the D. J. or be focused on right now I Believe a source told me\nThat the president does not want to stir the spot any more than you are and that would likely happen at the deputy attorney general live there or if he was fired or if he resigns so I think right now certainly up\nTo the election in November I Believe in a way that the White House will try to keep the department of justice that stable I possibly can while of it and do other equally important is and that's again like securing the non uh like securing Trump's nomination Cavanaugh\nI Believe that after the election or there will be I don't know I guess you can describe it as people rotating out and other people were located again\nThat's happening with this administration which by the way I think is that is generally a good thing to get people to do certain jobs and then you bring someone else and others\nAre or we can do or say that yes it looks like a Trojan gene is likely to be on his way out there ah after the elections regardless of whether or not um\nDemocrats take back the house or the Republicans hold it\nLeave Smith riding it real clear investigations on the fate of Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general for the next week I'm John bachelor this is John bachelor show\n\n\n\n\nYes it is it is a description of the challenge in the western Pacific with China being able to force\nThe U.S carriers back beyond the range of there and Barker wings which are currently comprised of F.

Thomas foe garden starting with the U.S government the user here is though has\nCreated the circumstances dramatically that brought America into the first World War in Nineteen Seventeen and they hinge upon a fantastic opera called December mentality that\nThere's ever been telegram intercepted by the British because they routinely read the mail of the gentleman called Americans that's what they did it in the decoded they laughed at American code they regarded them as simple as\nThe German codes were a little better the Germans have changed their codes a few times but they were good at that too there are a couple of guys name Nigel ... gray and others in the room forty that find reading a code easy unimportant deep distinction Thomas you make in your book\nWhat is the difference between a code an aside for\nA a a that's a good question and it took me some some time to understand that aside for a century if you take one letter and replace it with another\nDay to be for instance if you change if you change one letter to another or one symbol to another it's a\nIt's a ... for a cold is if you if you use a word um I'm In place off another word of another simple so that's that's the whole difference there um and uh those Emma and telegram was coated with not a cipher\nIt was in a code and there were several codes that the Germans were using Thirteen oh four oh five nine five o seven five hundred there was another way of talking about their code\nSummer summer good summer that you have a code book you conquer words and once you conquer word and you see it's repetition\nYou when you come to it again you know that's what they're using for example Zimmerman's name itself had a code and when you recognize that you saw that Zimmerman had signed the telegram compared to what we do today with signals intelligence is a simple ... remember where before digital communication where we've ...\nAnd also were before the first and second war that taught everybody\nThat gentleman do read each other's mail all the time in fact\nThey read so much they faked gentlemen's mail and that's why history\nIs a mystery always when you re discover how people came to decisions All right the telegram is intercepted hall gets it and he goes through what I have to say Thomas is a the work of a great novelist he created world within world so that there's always doubt\nAbout how the Zimmerman Telegram came into the hands of\nThe foreign secretary bow forward to hand to page on February twenty third and it creates such a world of mirrors that you spend a deal of your book or a A R translating those who have written about the ... over the last hundred years including hall\nWho are there many representative or misunderstood it your\nBook itself is a work of crypts analysis Thomas congratulations\nThank you thank you very much thank you very much halls work\nIs genius and he has to be one of the icons of signals intelligence is he given credit for that here in the twenty first century\nOh I think absolutely I think he absolutely is he is credited as one of the fathers of of a corrupt analysis now the interesting thing is of course hall himself had a very weak grass of crypt analysis\nHe himself was not was not a natural code breaker I'm I'm a ... you can see and his ... sometimes confuses these different codes and you know you have to read as ... with care because\nSometimes it's deliberate disinformation and sometimes I think he just doesn't understand you know the uh the fine points of Republican but he didn't have to be he was a fantastic manager and he was a political animal and I think this is what what what made him until it rent from the British perspective\nI'm I'm such a success story it wasn't that whole\nWhole you how to hire the right people\nAnd he knew how to manage these people well they all admire him these these these these amazing quote breakers um but he himself wasn't really a concern with this um with this minutiae um if I may I Would just like to elaborate a little bit on what happened of\nCourse and by the by what I Would say that hall is jobs and crypt analysis is a ... that's the difference between
