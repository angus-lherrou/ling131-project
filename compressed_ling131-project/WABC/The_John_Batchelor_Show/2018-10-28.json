by the preceding ... those are the laws are not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or you mean listening\nOn social media whether Seventy so in any way we see where the Facebook\nSo any so ABC\nDot com\n[noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting I'm Evan hanging\nGet a better chance well one of her friends who listens to this radio show called her up one night and told her hey\nTurn on the radio I listen to the doctor leader ... because he treats lung cancers without surgery without came out that he could most likely treat your lung cancer\nWith pinpoint non invasive radio surgery\nWithout the cutting without losing part of your lung without the hospital stay without the chess tubes the ivy without the infections and possible complications and not everyone makes it through open long surgery they have to cut out part of the law and usually the longest deflated\nThen they have to put chest tubes into blow up whatever's left with a long and then\nOnce you're healed\nIf they can send you home if you can't send your home then you go to a rehab or nursing home because this woman already had trouble breathing [noise]\nWell this woman called me up she heard from a friend a radio listener and I often say that radio listeners save lives she heard from a friend that radio surgery may be very useful she came in I saw her\nWe talked about all the options and I don't do the scariest thing I tell people okay you can have the surgery but remember going to lose part of your along and you can have those complications surgery is a mechanical removal of part of your body you won't have it back\nYou can have chemo but came out doesn't work really permanently to cure lung cancers it's Only Temporary measure that might shrink down the cancer for a little bit of time and then we'll come back most likely\nOr he could have standard radiation which would hurt a lot of healthy long it'll take weeks and weeks or you could have pinpoint radio surgery the work that we first brought to America pioneered for the original radio surgery this is the work we do\nWith invisible beams from thousands of angles we computerize the body we find the cancer and then from thousands of angles sending invisible beams just lay on the table ... and the treatment takes about ten minutes and then you get up and go\nAcross the street to Macy's or to lunch or to work or home or wherever you want to go but you're not stuck in a hospital there is no incision and no tubes and the ...\nAnd this is the work we do\nWell there's one more thing I should tell you about this lady and that is that I saw her a year ago yes I saw her a year ago and we just talked about all these options and then she said Dr lead them and I want you to treat me\nI Do not want surgery I Do not want chemo I Want you to treat me and I treated her a year ago\nAnd she came into the office I see patients and follow it but I should tell you that many people one of the most common questions I get is ...\nBut how are they going to do this works\nBecause sometimes invisible\nBeams and you get hit by a truck like by surgery you expect it to work even if you get worse from it\nThat radio surges pinpoint beams and yes we follow every patient yes we do exams and blood tests and scans whatever you want whatever you think it's appropriate and whatever the two of us think is appropriate we talk about that well\nShe came back this week and had a follow up scan\nAnd number one I saw her I walked in the room and I saw her I said Mrs\nNo oxygen and she said yeah ever since you treated me I don't need the oxygen anymore I said wow and then I showed her the scan we've got a new scan they said\nThe cancer is gone and she said you have to be and I said yes you're off of oxygen the cancers go on\nThere is no spread anywhere else there's no ... no bleeding no spreading okay mono surgery just a few pinpoint treatments that take ten minutes each and her cancer is gone she's off oxygen she's breathing like she's been Britain for the last decade\nShe's doing what she wants to do she has cancer free in remission no evidence of cancer and this is the work we do\nAnd I can tell you why did I speak about radio surgery what did they bring Radio City here why am I the Fritz in America was ready to surgery\nBecause I understood very well there is many many people like this woman who have brain tumors and catches the mouth and throat and lungs and breast and pancreas liver and bones and kidney and bladder and prostate in other sites to\nToo many dimensions lymph nodes\nAnd so many people can benefit if they only learned and that's why we're here today she went to one of the biggest hospitals and saw one of the biggest doctors and thought that the doctor would be telling her all the options but no\nThe doctor was just like a salesman for surgery\nHe never told her why can cut on you and root part of your along and you may even\nNot have got to the hospital or get off the ventilator or you can go see Dr leader of a half or he asserted wealthy said that's every patient they probably all becoming here is two Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nMost likely because who would want to have surgery if you're going to have a competing method of treatment which is highly successful noninvasive out patient covered by insurance Medicare Medicaid in general\nThis is the work we do we have lots of information to send you\nWe've got booklets DVDs got before and after pictures from head to toe and we have created cancers literally from head to toe\nTens of thousands of cancers

also call Dr Lieberman at two and two choices for a free informative booklet and DVD hey Dr Lederman we're back\nIf Dr Lederman with Kurdish we were talking about prostate cancer and he's the man who's lived the life\nOf not only live the life for didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead them in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear\nFried and hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out of control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery as your answer and I've been kicking myself and it took his ever since maybe the\nDome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with hollow show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill you oh yeah and they almost succeeded\nBut when you had that robotic surgery you\nSaid oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body liquids\nAnd I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot\nI was not to go to you Dr Gilead them in and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's in his life from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then\nTo try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Mike I might as well as being a unit I was ... and naturally that plays a head game on you and that you don't even\nFeel like you're a man any long ago it was just a bad decision and I didn't have the guidance and I should've come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery\nAnd I would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain\nPalaces and we leave myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since she was twenty twelve and I'm Still play with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever worn you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats actually you took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being incontinent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know ... about that in advance\nYou're a man who communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in ... I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but there was so sure of themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go\nWrong it was more like a Powell Thirteen Apollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize\nOh my God as you look at the ivy that you should onto and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in fact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad\nAnd sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was in my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease and stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only would say in good shape I wasn't heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate removal surgery\nBecause now when your basic functions when you can't you were in a when you can have sex when all of those things go right not only does it affect you mentally and you get depressed\nBut you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of\nA sudden you look down at your trousers and you've had an accident and now what do you do\nRabbits sweater and wrap it around yourself and run off to the new rich bathroom and then you always carrying around it depends with you and you're saying\nWhy did I Do this to myself am I Am ... and you said no I'm not a mask is I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic\nDon't believe the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is your doctor Gilead him in because you're not part of the old boy's club you are independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYou'll patients painless message of recovery fully\nRemaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate\nCancer you know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic\nHow do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars if I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be\nTurning them into a person who can no longer physically function\nWhy am I doing this when there are other remedy\nAnd why are they doing it because this is their business the surge and all they know how to do is cut out your prostate that claimed the control so much a what a man does and I would suggest that everyone out there a void that at all costs don't be still not don't be a dummy like I was\nGet that valued second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and you will feel fully functional again\nThank you so much my place and we're talking about a man this man is Ninety One if you look at him he looks like the sixty one he's a man who's

two vigils for the eleven people killed in this morning's mass shooting up the tree of life synagogue was held in Pittsburgh tonight\nAt the top of Bowers page he claims Jews are the children of Satan\nIronic that Satan seems rubber taken this guy\nTwo hours before you open fire in the synagogue Bowers was ranting about the Hebrew immigrant aid society and the Jewish nonprofit the AIDS refugees Bowers wrote and again this is two hours before he wanted the synagogue and open fire\nThe Hebrew immigrant aid society likes to bring in invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nAgain in saying\nThis is a shooting that cannot be connected to Donald Trump and I'm sure that frustrates the Democrats at least in any sane way it\nCan be connected because powers hates Trump\nAnd wrote the Trump is controlled by Jews and created an infestation of Jews\nAlthough he didn't use the word Jews used a racial slur President Trump campaigned in Illinois tonight\nHe explained that he refused to cancel the event saying you can't let monsters when\nThey said that it is it is ... is a song\n\n\nOr anything to extract causes of anti Semitism\nFrom a Trump called for the death penalty so did the attorney general Jeff Sessions but Trump says we need to reform the death federally law so that it doesn't take ten years to put someone to death\nI understand the sentiment\nI get the need for revenge and the passion of the moment but the truth is the death penalty will do nothing to solve this problem\nIt's never been a deterrent\nDemocrats were quick to call for gun control the idiot grandstanding senator from Connecticut Richard Blumenthal\nWhen are you guys going to get rid of him in Connecticut seriously he he was an embarrassment Blumenthal went as far as to say that Congress is complicit in the shooting because if it's an action Blumenthal has no shame\nHe's using the shooting for politics to stir up the base in the midterms since they can't blame the president for this one they'll go after Congress and blame the Republicans\nIntros\nNot one new gun law or any of that are being bandied about would have stopped the shooting\nOurs did not have a criminal record and he had an active\nLicense for the rifle in three hand guns he took into the synagogue he had no history of mental illness although obviously he was mentally ill it wouldn't it showed up\nMaking the call today\nWhile they're still sorting through bodies for an increase in gun control even more poor and\nBecause they knew\nIt would be of no use in the shooting but they want to use it to win elections\nShame on all of them and it wasn't just Blumenthal others did this as well can we just mourn for a second can we be a little reflective\nWe joined together for a moment instead of going into our corners and shooting spit balls at one another\nThere was this tribal instinct to immediately blame\nAnd a political instinct\nTo not let a tragedy you go to waste no matter how insensitive or despicable eleven people are dead in Pittsburgh simply because they believed in something greater than themselves they were killed not because of who they were\nFor what they were doing the gunman didn't really care about that he didn't care who they were as individuals\nThat were killed because of their face\nTo face that the gunman didn't agree with the faith that became the outlet for men men's rage\nIn both cases this week of Mad Men raging against the group because he doesn't agree with them\nCaesar say a few tempted serial bomber and Robert Bowers the synagogue mass murderer they rented in threatened enraged on social media before going through with their threats\nThey told anyone who would listen what they were going to do\nAnd authorities never saw this social media sites never saw this\nNo one on those social media sites said anything well actually one person did will get that the second\nYou had Alex Jones and others being banned from social media not for threatening to kill anyone then you have these threats that go unnoticed\nBut I'll tell you what maybe it's just because we become immune to dangerous talk maybe in this climate we accepted as a norm\nWe should because sometimes these nuts mean what they say\nOne eight hundred for a WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two I Would love to get your thoughts on this tonight Andy B from Staten Island you're in Seventy seven WABC\nYeah Larry I had a good song for you to vote for it off for a week that's a good idea yeah I thought we were\nGoing to have a kid too about the bombs that didn't go off that service bomb went off today I mean a loving people the Jewish people that I'm In a predominantly Jewish neighborhood they're like family people their kids happy go lucky running around this guy's a meant maniac\nAnd you know an essay and the FBI getting in bed with politicians like Hillary to send people after listening to Clinton's campaign and after Trump's campaign or the wait staff to work out a system where they're tapping into the site goes not worry about who's running for president\nThe thing is these both of them both so then let everybody knew know who would listen what they were going to do yeah they have\nWays to chopping listening people's conversation there what's your name in the wrong places\nThere they were waiting this stuff on social media sites both of them were writing it on social media sites and nobody took notice of that\nNow because they take a crisis don't let a good crisis go to waste the Democrats come right out pushing that gun control I Try to help anything\nYet nope it's because the none of them neither of them are leaders\nThey were thought to be just insignificant both of these guys were thought to be in significant they'll go after look I don't like Alex Jones but I don't think he did anything that was so important or threatening that he needed to be banned from Twitter or Facebook or YouTube and he was from all those sites\nAnd there there are other conservatives that if I had a problem on Facebook because of some of the things that I was posting and and it was all of it was just the kind of stuff I say here\nWell because it's ... advertising thing that all ... fleeting so if you're a writer you you got no shot really any doubts Alex Jones isn't harming anybody they're going after the wrong people\nAnd then they just going to use this whole thing and Trump is right again Sean mastery changed with the ... federally even for these ... I mean maybe water from if we stop one of them\nAnd we start like that that maybe fifty years from now maybe a hundred years from now they'll know what to do but it has to start somewhere\nAll right Andy thanks a lot as always thanks for the phone call I have\nA great show thank you for your show\nThank you Andy joke from Brooklyn urine Seventy seven WABC\n[noise] um I read that you see this on the I'm looking at the Internet right now or ... or ... or ...\nYeah I was just talking about it a second ago\nOkay I missed it because I was talking to the square ... what do you think about that I mean according to what I'm looking at\nAh something about China interesting just fine but meaning of it was so scared and you know put on the meaning of they try and yes you have to think about doing it ... immigration rights aside\nSituation number one Trump very mentioned the death penalty in a situation like this and I can understand where it's coming from the personally I'm I'm against the death penalty and I think there's things worse\nThan the death penalty like life in prison without parole solitary I agree with you I agree\nWith that type of thing that needs to be ... because there's the problem is is that if you kill somebody and and you made a mistake you can't get back to our lives that's just the way that it is and then the other thing I wanted to comment\nOn ... on that and I'll let you continue but for stepping up per second it's not only that it's not only that it's worse but it it's harder on the families because the process drags out so long and it necessarily has to drag out so long it's never been proved ever been proved to be a deterrent and it costs more\nTo put somebody to death and to keep them in prison for the rest of their lives so there's no benefit except vengeful and is that being said\nI was in Chicago uncovered the John Wayne Casey trial and I was ... and I was I I had a chance by the way because I Won the lottery to go to seize execution and I and I passed on it I gave it to somebody else because I didn't want to watch somebody died\nAnd I get it I get it with Casey I talked to the the mothers of the victims I understand that feeling of vengeful illness but saying are people are supposed to step in and say this is wrong\nThat we we can't punish killing with killing we can't say they'll shell not kill and then turn around and kill somebody it's it's a it's a moral so\nThe but I understand it I thought that being said I get it and and if somebody did somebody something in someone in my family I Would want them dead but but society should step in and stop me from that anyway I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo should I I'm I'm totally lined with that um the the other thing I wanted to mention is about\nThe it's a people who have a Jewish heritage who are who seem to be anti Jewish and I actually do have a friend\nWho's that who's ... has Jewish heritage and I think\nYou know it's just been steeped in it so long he has kind of like a nasty and it's not around the Jews per se but it's re weeks in particular or Israeli policies and he's like very pro box and all this and I just looking to make like how can you be that way\nBut and yet you still that way so you do get some people who are like although they you'd think they'd be a line one way they're definitely a hundred and eighty degrees what you'd expect being that the ... been raised in that direction\nYeah I well I was surprised by Joe thanks a lot of Joe I was surprised\nBy Joe because he seems so hateful he seems so full of paid but his hate seems to be directed towards his own people because or at least I shouldn't say his own people because obviously people can be different inside of a group and and just to say your own people as almost Oreo typing but\nHe's upset with fellow Jews because he believes there to the left and so the divide in this country and\nBy the way of getting to this and the second there is there's academic studies on this divide in this country is no longer about race it's no longer about gender it's no longer about sex is no longer about economy it's no longer about\nThe education the divide in this country is not suicidal the divide in this country's political now it's the number one discrimination in this country we hate the other side we've gotten to the point where we hate for politics the yard it with Joe\nYou heard it was just a second ago that he doesn't like them because of their immigration policy that that's why he dislikes Joe who said he was Jewish dislikes Jews who want to bring or help immigrants once they get over here\nAnd it's what we heard is what we got from the the attempted bomber\nIt's what we've heard time and time again in this country one eight hundred eight

Radio [noise]\n\nPollution just burger or made it a rash they got into a gunfight with Robert Bowers\nWho didn't take his own life so I think he wanted to make a statement I think he wanted to talk to police and apparently he yelled out all Jews should die but he also hated Donald Trump he he killed eleven people but he thought\nDonald Trump was too close to use in the world and he thought Jews were controlling Donald Trump be he wrote in social media and so he disliked Trump thought so I said ... they really can't blame Trump for this one they they they're not going to be able to but\nPat says from New York did she heard on CNN and MSNBC that's exactly what was happening what did you hear about\nRepublicans start blaming Democrats ... ... and ... ours was a Democrat yeah they started blaming Trump because of the things he said about George Soros George Soros hates Israel he isn't a he's a self hating Jew from Hungary\nHe wants to Israel destroyed him when the thoughts or fabric can\nTaunts diet the face of the Democratic party this is the anti Semitic Democrat Party we've been watching for a year at ... best friend to Israel I'm Jewish and there's only Fifteen million Jewish men women and the entire world and children and the entire world I'm a minority\nSo I'm getting fed up with this apartheid we lived in Israel I've been to Israel lived there\nA hundred times and the last Thirty years it's not a part I I have plenty of Arab Christian friends and Muslim Arab friends they love living in Israel this Eddie at this anti self hating Jew or anti Semite yet before apartheid\nIt's the Palestinians that how much that are always white starting wars and rockets\nFrom Gaza and Israel\nDefends itself they want all Jews that the Democrats I'm telling you and\nI got that all of this ... two thousand and five and Israel's been getting over thirty thousand rockets\nYeah I Know I Know yeah pad their thank you pat down\nThere today from God that's so apartheid you gotta be kidding me\nThough I think he was just trying to make I don't know whether you can point of view trying to make but he wanted to get in this thing about socialism at the end so uh I think you can I can understand his political leaning\nTrevor from the Bronx and here's this is interesting forever I was scared you were going to call and uh I was scared you were going to call because in the past you have you seen like you were beginning against Jews in in some of the ... to some of your calls is that fair to say\nOkay uh before you actually launch into a smear\nI'm not hearing you I'm asking you I mean is in a character Trevor I'm not\nI'm not assassinate your character I asked you I said there was many times in the past where it seemed like you were beginning they didn't seem like you were blaming Jews of the problems in the country and I'm asking you that question is I Am I right\n... crops from your vantage point maybe but before I go into before I lose precious time going back and forth debating if\nThat will support I like I Would like do you do you denounce what happened today in Pittsburg by all means okay great let's say let's see if\nThis guy really believed that Jews as I Believe that'd be organized Jewish community\nAs a whole not every single Jewish member of the organizers community of your of the Jewish minority but the Jewish community as a whole if you believe\nThat they are strongly overwhelmingly backing a open doors massive third world immigration and the United states ... tell me\nHow are you helping your cause by walking with synagogue where maybe some of the people in that should have got are opposed to a Muslim immigration or post a Mexican immigration\nAnd slower a bunch of innocent people how are you helping your calls all you're doing is giving the media cannon fodder to censor\nAt you and to prosecute people like yourself on the basis of their political beliefs because believe me the politicians in the media are going to use it for them\nTo offer more hate speech laws hate crime laws gun control laws to subvert our bill of rights that is\nThat you address around the pike Trevor ... and with that I Do have to go and I apologize for that because I really wanted to get your opinion on that\nBecause of the conversations we've had some bad we're coming back right emphasis\nDiet dot coms\n\nReport deadly Pittsburgh shooting climate banana twenty nine criminal truck parts of it when it gets\nReally custody after a shootout with a SWAT Team police say the suspected gunman shouted all Jews must die as they stormed the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh during Saturday services killing eleven worshipers and wounding six other people including for police officers before he was arrested\nStrong passion drivers and so this midterm election is consequential but why you hear that is because what you're being told is that you've got to get out the vote that this is stream Lee important you get a get out the vote\nBecause in a mid term it's getting at people out to vote getting your people out to vote more than the other side getting their people at the ... that makes sense on any that I just I wanted to make sure why you're hearing all these ...\n... and and look I think you should vote I'm going to vote I voted every election in my adult life\nEven though I'm registered as an independent because of it in the media for so long but it in where I vote I I sometimes can only vote on the questions I Can't vote on the candidates because I Can't vote in the primaries\nBut I go to all the time so I think you should get out and vote but I Wonder if you understand\nWhy you're hearing terms like that the future of the country in the future of the free world\nOur identity the most consequential election in history you can hear a lot of that that to get your riled up to them and I don't think you should need you need that I don't think you need that to go out and vote you should go out and vote because you're an American citizen and you're sweating but\nI Do want to talk about saves are say Iraq he was a he was an absolute gift to the Democrats Donald Trump is right when he says the attempted serial bomber and I'm not going to call them the Mac a bummer that to CNN concoction\nBut this ... this attempted serial bomber was the best thing that could happen to the Democrats because they there was\nAll of this renewed Republican passion the Republicans were all going up in the polls that caravan was the worst thing that could have happened to the Democrats because a lot of people who were inspired by it especially the Republican base and and even\nSome Democrats and independents we're going wait a second I don't I don't want that I don't want ten thousand people showing up and just getting into the country\nSo it was a real winter for Donald Trump\nAnd then you had all of these packages man did the media run with that I get it I mean that's a story there's no question it's a big story you President Obama the former president the former vice president Hillary Clinton getting something George Soros getting something and then man when they realized it was all people that\nTrump\nHas seen as an enemy in the tropics attack they were really going crazy with this\nAnd then when they saw his van and they saw ... and they realized he was a big\nTrump supporter they were able to blame Donald Trump for this bomb it was unfair it was ridiculous it wasn't logical but they were able to blame Donald Trump this was a nut job\nWho would've liked anybody he happened to like Donald Trump and he hated people who didn't agree with that I'm from\nThe Donald Trump responsible for that job because there's a lot of people that agreed with Donald Trump your call all the time there are you ready to run out and attack somebody because you like Donald Trump no because you're saying\n\nIt's happened on both sides has happened and we'll talk about we'll talk more about that and the second\nWhat would I don't get is this this guy was telling everybody what he was gonna do everybody knew he was in a job he was arrested dozens of times he's threatening to send out bombs before how was your nobody's radar\nHow'd it nobody keep an eye on him added added nobody worry about it\n\nI Would think they would have no right away that it was a guy running around\nHow difficult was he the fine he's running around him as a man with Donald Trump all over it and he's threatened to bomb people before\n\nHe did it on Twitter constantly no Twitter who is throwing conservatives off left and right shutting down Twitter sites suspending people they don't suspend sales are say\n\nEven though he threatened a political commentator Rochelle Ritchie\n\nAnd said\nHe was going to get her he was a bummer and she\n\n[laughter] then\nSent a letter I tried to turn that off that I call from the air [laughter] I Try to turn that off\n\nAnd she she went to Twitter and said\n\nLook this guy started bombing you know can you can this is threatening can you can you get rid of his account can you can you turn this over to authorities so she did the right thing went to Twitter they wrote back door in\nQuickly and said\nThat is not a violation of Twitter rules against abusive behavior\nSo they let\nCrazy is cool I Love ... I Love the way you handle to be attracted to catch them and so forth but he wouldn't budge but he did say that I shouldn't have done that 'cause his point couldn't get ... gotten across it'd be basically supported the guy indirectly you ... you heard what he said\nYeah what was interesting from Trevor I thought Trevor was was actually pretty loose it tonight and it was all going to buy here yeah he was because what he said was\nHe was upset with used that word supporter but immigration and that were supportive of open borders that's what he was so I've never heard that from him I I Do think he's been at a medical and\nThe air yeah these apps yeah you're right ... so I but I wanted to hear what do you have to say because it was important given All right great given the events of the day and that's why I took him and that's why I wanted to talk you know I I\nThought you tried to print 'em down any backed out which he normally that you're you're very good on\nThat but he was really I thought he was good too because he be at least he gave his reasons and then he said that he he denounced what happened today but he's announced it and believe me I I think that he all he I I don't think to represent type of person that would take a life and I don't think Trevor is that hate both of the\nThe one that stays in the shadows and doesn't give his name he's the type that high that's the worst type of person you got to be careful of that type of one who who does it from a distance where you don't see him he only calls were falling names but I Want us to talk about uh\nYour the election if I Know it's just so quickly I have taken a course I'm going to be at the uh one of the election centers here in New York I volunteered and so forth and what happens is\nYou may be a ... for the Democrats yeah by Democrats obviously I'm a ...
