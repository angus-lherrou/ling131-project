to protest rents were killed in the fish will say is the deadliest transportation related accident in almost ten years in the U.S correspond to pull those ... reports from ... New York were officials are trying to learn why a limousine crashed Saturday afternoon\nWhat was supposed to be a joy to write and digging tragedy here in upstate New York I can tell you they're both state and federal investigators are back at the same tonight again I saw them for the New York state police as well as the national Transportation Safety board's tropical\nPart of the reason the arthritis is developing is because the bones are not gliding as smoothly as they are they're supposed to be won over the other and when they're not ... gliding as smoothly as they're supposed to be\nWhat happens is you get irritation of the bones and maybe even a little bit of wearing a way of the cartilage and when bone is irritated bone responds to stress\nAnd so bone feels that stress in the way that stress manifest itself is by you grill bone spurs that's how bone spurs form and why is that bone not lighting the way it's supposed to be that so frustrating because\nThe reason is because the ligaments aren't strong enough to hold the bones in place while they're gliding over one another\nAnd so they sort of it's not like they totally dislocate that can happen if the ligaments totally torn and people with a C ... are very aware of that\nBut the more common scenario is that there is this lack city in the ligament and so the bones don't move as smoothly over each other like they're supposed to and they show signs of that ... the irritation might start with the little loss of cartilage and then a little growth of a bone spur and then as\nIt progress is\nThe narrow the loss of the cartilage gets more prevalent the bone spurs world further and the because you're losing that cartilage the bones are getting closer together\nAnd that's where you start to get from little bone spur cause and a little lost the cartilage causing mild arthritis to the joint starting to narrow that monitor arthritis and when the joint arthritis ... when the knee arthritis becomes severe that is where\nI'm ... you may have heard of the term bone on bone and ah if anyone's had severe arthritis they may have heard that term it's a very daunting a kind of turned to here so that's more advanced arthritis where you've totally lost that joint space\nSo it's a a very frustrating condition and\nPotentially a very debilitating condition but the good news is there are things that can help that ... one of the things that can\nBe most beneficial is prologue therapy so we're going to talk more about how ... therapy can play a role in arthritis even though our brightest seems to be a bone condition\nWell the reason the reason it's not just the only condition is because it's not just the bones that are causing the pain it's the ligaments those last ligaments that led to the arthritis in the first place\nThat are part of the source of pain so again this is Dr Warren sleigh ten I'm at the regenerative healing center right in the heart of ... Ridgewood New Jersey you can reach me at my office at two o one a day to Fifteen hundred to a one eight eight to ...\nTeen hundred or you can call a uh after the show again too I wanted to Fifteen hundred or and my website and Jay polo dot com and Jay polo dot com so again let's talk about\nWe were talking about how pro therapy can help when the arthritis so what is happening so what's happening is\nAs we're getting those bones getting closer to gather the ligaments or getting weaker and weaker and we need to do something to strengthen those ligaments now what's really interesting about near arthritis\nIs that even though there's a bone on bone arthritis right that that sounds terrible I Can't do anything about that well the reality is that if you're told that your bone on bone arthritis chances are you've had arthritis for months and years\nAnd a lot of times you didn't even know it\nYou may feel a little ... but it never was really painful and then all of a sudden you do something you might twist the wrong way turn the wrong way and all of a sudden the pain manifest itself and it becomes you present into the doctor's office limping with moderate severe knee pain and\nThe doctor does the X ray and comes back into the room and tells you\nYou have severe arthritis okay but and how severe that dock it's bone on bone oh no that's terrible but the reality is it was either bone on Boehner near bone on bones for months and\nPossibly even years before you had any symptoms at all and so even though you are feeling this even though you have this arthritis for years you're just now maybe over the last month or two feeling these symptoms so\nHaving the diagnosis of bone on bone arthritis does not mean that the pain that you're experiencing can't be relieved with conservative measures so let's talk about some of these ... some of these conservative measures\nI'm going to mention a couple of them one is a steroid injection\nAnd a steroid injection is commonly done for arthritic pain\nAnd whether the arthritis is mild moderate severe oh we could put some steroids in there that'll help it along well it will help all along it may give you some pain relief maybe for a short time maybe for a week maybe for a month maybe even a couple of months however\nThe part of helping it along is it's also helping to some extent to possibly help progress the arthritis says well why because they're always\nEat away a tissue and that is just one of their effects or side effects it's just what they do and because of this\nWe being ... we the or are we in quotes we doctors we limit steroid injections we limit the steroid injections to three year well\nAnd we have a sort of recognition you don't want to put ... too much they're right there so we'll do three years so we won't eat away at too much to issue but if you're eating away at tissue with three because you do three injections chances are you're eating away at some tissue with one injection as well so you really\nI don't recommend the steroid injections I don't recommend them because\nThe relief that you get from them as short term and they have a harmful effects not just on the knee itself but potentially on the body itself that the a steroid affects the immune system\nThis uh negatively and or the steroid thins out bone again you say oh we're just doing one injection sure it's not going to cause too much damage but it's not a good thing when you're giving a medication that has such terrible\nToxicity associated with it so we generally it we try to avoid is they're injection especially when you have an option like polo therapy which is regenerative and when I say regenerate if it helps grow tissue rather than steroids which either way a tissue so\nPro therapy just seems that much more logical way to go and\nWhile I Am saying this the good news for myself and for all my patients is that we have data that\nProves that pro therapy works and that kind of date I'm Talking about or double blind level one studies\nThere are which is the highest standard of studies that the highest standard of research that\n... that can prove that treatment works double blind means some patients got\nA what we call a sham treatment\nAnd some patients got real polo therapy and the ones that got the real pro and the doctor to double blind means the doctor didn't know which one he he he or she was giving and the patient didn't know which one they were getting and so with that we saw that the ones that got polo therapy did better than the ones\nThat did not so that's double blind level one evidence that prologue therapy is effective so it seems to be the natural choice in what's good\nAbout that is that it has\nNo toxicities associated with it and there's\n... it's it's not like you're limited in the amount that\nYou do a pro therapy is the number of treatments are limited 'cause there's no Texas cities but you don't need more than if you treatments to achieve a successful outcome and that varies up the number of treatments that you need\nOr the average is between three and six treatments and the reason is unlike a steroid which is a one shot deal and you hope you're basically trying to get rid of him all information all pain ... therapy is sort of engineering tissue your gradually building the strength of tissue\nAnd so it's not something that it's not an overnight treatment but it's something that\nOver a few treatments you're going to get a ... you're going to have stronger tissue you're going to have less pain and feel much better so pro therapy is a ... is a great option for the arthritis now or if you have mild to moderate right is it's a good option because it can help\nUh stabilize the knee and while I I Can't say for sure that it would help\nPrevent progression of the arthritis\nIt certainly helps with the pain that you're experiencing at that time\nAnd it strengthening tissue so that enables you to be more active which is a great for all my most of my patients appreciate that\nAnd another aspect of it is that even when it's bone on bone arthritis so again the option is a new replacement but there there's a few problems with that someone might be too young for any replacement so if you're too young\nThe knee replacement generally is set to have a shelf life uh Fifteen Years they are the it seems to be gradually improving hopefully but there is still limitation over time you're going to wear out that\n\n\n\n\n\nAh\n[laughter] I didn't know where you're going to stop that I didn't know when you were going to\nA I was I thought it was early ...\nAxle rose to join you guys just well I'm an actor and you hear me they could even from from political\nOh yes that's a stump local we are untangling the Web of digital marketing and also playing weird guitar ring tones apparently so I'm welcome to our show thank you for joining us\nThis Sunday night we do have a lot of stuff we want to get to tonight we want to get back to basics we want to talk some websites listings\nOr updates social media and all kinds of good stuff but um [noise] let's go\nAround the room say Hi Andrew Weber is here the grew of all things marketing\nFit is fantastic to be here this Sunday night great to see run old Derek in Lexie good evening good evening Mr will pond everybody Ronald for half a a October yes I'll fall is here\nFall is a is definitely hear my football team's pretty much stuck\nRight um\nI can say that they don't know who they are but there\nAre no everything's good kids are good\nIt's business as good as this is a moving forward quickly and the fender the years come in and people are doing a lot of business and that's a good time over to talk about how I can be found more than my competitors can be found them and that's kind of why we're here\n... so where do we want to go first or do we want to talk about a Web sites because we do run into a scenario the longer we're in business and growing and all that good stuff that we build a great website for a client up to date monitor and secure all that good stuff\nAnd a couple of years two three four years go by and we're we're making tweaks and updates of course but you kind of look back at some point and you go wow you know so much has changed so quickly that\nYou know maybe it's time to for ... [noise]\nYeah just because she had a a Web site doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to flock to you or a website presidents because you had it what are you doing to promote your website it's like having the store [noise]\nYou know on the street but if you're not promoting your store on the street you just have a sign there's a good possibility that people won't even know anything about it\nSo we encourage our clients sentiment to have a great looking a website with all the bells and whistles but obviously you need to do something with that website you need to optimize the website you need to add\nContent to that website you need to make people want to go to your side or engage with you you have a a you know a a no doubt forum on your site that people can you know contact you do you have to project gallery [noise]\nDo you have a video on your website you know what key words come up with your website when was the last time you actually add any content that's relevant to this time of the year I mean let's let's talk about but it's October now for all right what what are you doing a few months ago during the summer we even thinking about your website\nWhere were you on the head of the twenty six more specifically exactly you know where were you suffer\n[laughter] that [laughter] but my point is a lot of people don't think about you know\nTheir website or marketing until you're in it and then at that point you know it could be too late to really give you enough time to build traction not show at some local our approach is be proactive and really um [noise]\nMake sure that you're out there doing best practices that guidelines\nAnd the results that we have found had been a excellent for our clients\nAnd if you haven't done anything to your website in like five or ten years or even if you have but you're not sure it was built in the right preferred format which is a response of format\nGo to your website and test it out and see if it is responsive no response of websites basically respond to whatever\nDevice size you're using so if you're on a desktop it's going to look and it's going to function a certain way and then if you're on a mobile phone on the same site it's going to fold up nicely the menu style is going to change and it's going to really looking function great on mobile and the same goes for tablet\nSo if you go to your browser on if you have a a laptop or a desktop available type in your website\nAnd then shrink your screen meaning make it center and then wider and see if your website is expanding and contracting and changing in a way it looks and functions like the menu or goes from being say on the top of the page to like a hamburger menu\nIf it's not doing that you may have a an unresponsive site and you may even have a mobile version of your site when you go direct from your mobile phone\nBut that's not the preferred way by the search engines and it's also not the preferred way if you want to have the best user experience on all devices out there which people have many different sized devices these days\nSo um make sure that your website as responsive but even if it is there's been a lot of changes updates upgrades\nEven if you built it within the past few years so it's it's something that you know we we talk about a dump local our best selling fastest growing service area\nFor two thousand Nineteen is going to be something that we probably haven't even heard of yet that's how fast this stuff moves so\nWe try to keep you up to date as best she can uh but you also have to be proactive like Andrew said too [noise] yeah\nI mean if you haven't touched your sight you know in a while or you have any agency or a marketing company gave them a call and ask them what they're doing for you know many educate many times we find out that these marketing companies really aren't doing anything\nThey're just sending you a automated reports that would be sent you regardless but the charge you money for that and you know again we've we've we've spoken about this many times in the past [noise]\nAt some political we actually show you exactly the work involved the amount of time involved to build out certain pages or build that you'll listings or write an article\nAnd we get very detailed reporting and analytics says well not all your other marketing agencies\nProviding this for you what results are you getting to these are all questions that you need to ask yourself and that we've been doing this for a lot of years now we have you know many hundreds of clients and are we

know we look forward to seeing if we can get you guys you know on at the next level where you guys need to be at so give us a call\nPlease give us a call I was gonna say 'cause\nThere are a lot of the companies that are out there that are in the same industry as we are I think a big part of the things that we provide the services that we provide or these other companies but I always think all this has about communication and expectations and I think a lot of times\nThe business owners think certain things are getting done maybe it's not communicating the right way or the wrong there\nAre false a false I'm\nThinking of a word there under their thinking something's being done it as not being done\nBecause the communication is up there with whoever they're dealing with ... once I get to a nearby specific fault but just kind of happens misunderstanding here so I I think so and they do a website 'cause there's a lot of companies out there if I said to people out there in the audience go look at your Web sites\nYou have a blog page because there's a lot of companies that have that\nWhen you go to the library and you see that there was never any articles created maybe they thought or there was back in two thousand Thirteen maybe they thought\nThe company was the company that did the website with providing it maybe the coming there to the services thought that the since the customer was going to Korea because the 'cause usually well up there\nAt the Irish factors in here we can say the word\nBlog ... it's just the miscommunication sometimes so I think one of the things I'd like to pride ourselves on is that we're very transparent we tell them everything that we're due for in constant contact with these people about everything that we're doing it\nAnd hey I mean that's a lot of the reason why we're on the radio is we're trying to make things a little clearer and help with our communication\nSimple because I get it gets very complicated and I think one of the things that comes back to me about these shows is that we're we're trying dumb this data making very simple there's a lot of moving parts it gets very complicated even I don't understand some of the stuff sometimes but I Know the basics\nThere and you got the article how ugly it in a website and and the video when I got to the website and I watch it on like this place like state of the artist looks great and I check those reviews people are saying great things we have a good start reading done it's it's over\nSo it's a formula it's really not that complicated you know this about seven or

see [noise]\n\nThe day but Daniel reports the NTSB calls the Saturday crash the deadliest transportation related accident in the U.S in nearly ten years the crash triggered a massive response including\nTo handle a project from start to finish\nUm first of all we're very passionate about our design the reason we went into that direction of design and build is because sometimes we so we saw designs being watered down chain\nYou being very polite and I'll tell you what your eye or anything yeah I just talking about you know [laughter]\nSo we got more and more involved in overseeing the project we learned a lot about construction\nAbout who to hire and when ... or what to watch out for and it came as a natural progression to just do the whole thing from beginning to end\nOr it gives us the ability to oversee the project mhm our clients love it because they don't have to get involved with the contractors and overseeing and Ryan and payments right\nA lot of maintenance they're a lot of maintenance class and they are allowed civility and responsibility or doing another round after\nYou know and and knowledge knowledge that comes from experience learning from your prior mistakes or or just learning ... every project is a learning experience that never ends you when you think you know it all it was something that comes up to its new\nBrand new so let's go back or you mean act to has been around for two decades yes in some of the early days when perhaps you just to design and handed it off ...\nPerhaps the project that comes to mind that like that that was just a major frustration that like you know I design something I had something so clear a sketch to that it was and I just you were like you know they say pulling your hair out of like\nOh I ... it ... the subjects\nProject to mind I remember one very\nClearly because I remembered that frustration a it was a a residential building a beautiful building in Queens\nBut designed to everything came out so beautiful everything was so coordinated we gave in a spec sheet everything was labeled older style numbers everything was there and for some reason I was passing by and I said to myself let me go in and see what it looks like\nWhen they were in that might are are there were no no no they're in the middle of construction\nAnd I'm walking in somebody's laying floor and I'm looking at the floor and I say that's not what we chose [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] so the I call the contract amount he says well that's what they shipped we ordered something and that's what they ship I said did you check it with respect to see that it's the same number people make mistakes right no I didn't\nFor somebody you know we can walk in and and there was a different wallpaper\nOr different shades two different shades of different dialects because in in our industry mhm they said it so I asked us advice this so off you're putting two papers when it does the other one looks lighter than the other\nI said oh they said that they have to die lots of the same paper and I said it's OK\nBut it really isn't my and all this happens in an area that's very visible\n[laughter] where they're going to know whether the light is the strongest and ... and even though I couldn't go on and on it can take\nWe could take the entire interview to just talk about these things so you can see why we felt that we were just needed to do with\nThe importance again we're just stressing the importance that if someone's going to take a project on see it through to to the finish line even though you know and all the flip side is are you a control freak and perhaps the answer is yes yes yes because because\nBut you know what I'm saying that may\nBe not as you want it to come at the way you envision it are my

this evening is the presidents of act to interiors ... thank you for joining me here in mind that [noise]\nBefore the break we were talking about the importance of seeing something through from start to finish I Would imagine also that are your clients probably are\nNot somewhat relief probably very relieved also to know that ah it's off their head they don't have to be bothered by it you're taking it from a to Z and you're taking responsibility for the accuracy of the project correct\nBecause at the end the main part is is that they can continue working right they can focus on what they do ... do best exactly if anyone went through renovation in the working place [laughter] you know what can do to a bit I Know\nWe we built a building here right so now there is so much discussed about the research of interior design interior decorating um I Know you could probably go on for hours on the subject\nUm and soon I not even in in this question I Want to get to the fact how it differs from industry industry but perhaps you could just shed some light on the psychology\nA at which of course interprets into the importance of great interior or I'm beyond and design\nSo the word psychology is a big word in in interior design and whenever I interviewed potential employees I always tell them and especially those that are right out of school that thing that they're going to do pretty designs all day long and I say look\nThis work is five percent is nine Ninety five percent of everything else and the good part of it is psychology\nUm it's all about psychology you really when you design you have to be able to get into that person's being ... you need to understand what they like you need to know what talks to them you need to understand what they don't like\nWhen you designed for businesses you have to understand their business\nYou have to go through the whole process from beginning to end so that you can design a place that's mood and increases productivity mhm uh when you design for healthcare gosh there's so many studies\nOn the effect of good interior design on healing on the healing passes it was proven that it's a hundred percent a factor in people getting better\nSo everything is does not everything is psychology when you do a residential building ... the feeling that people get the residents get when they're building looks good is is tremendous\nOr does that does that increase value to a business to a building owner by having fantastic interior design without a doubt without a doubt that that's that's a no brainer for the for the bottom line it affects the bottom line it affects the ...\nAll the time it affects about an hour approach to design and he's not just to make a pretty space ...\nWhen we speak to our clients you say what is the purpose of this what are you trying to achieve but it's so when we do residential buildings if they had vacancies we understand that they want to create more right right and nobody can sing and I know ... if they want to increase demand\nTo interior dot com that's act to the number two interiors dot com we're going to take a short commercial break stay tuned\nSo recently unhealthy

design work act to in theory or is that Congress acts to the numbers to interiors dot com [noise]\nUm and we're having a really a fascinating conversation about the importance of rape interior design not just from an are an artsy points of view from my bottom\nLine points of view it really can help drive your business I'm In fact ... and I'm just gonna ask the question is great we touched on it earlier and by the way if you're just tuned in no worries the listeners know every single episode is up on ... radio dot com this show as well will be up and M. Y. B. radio dot com\nOr by Tuesday Morning so how can the physical design of a business uh really help drive the bottom line at a business is is it really that it it can really have such a profound impact\nIt's critical critical ... yes yes and we see it over and over again um I'll give you an example from residential building yes a lever coal to design a lobby core adore Jim in in\nMiddle range building had quite a few vacancies okay let me finish the design now other than that right\nUnhappy tenants the management company was warning us ... these people are very unhappy you'll have a lot of complaints to be careful don't don't worry but I take it with a grain of salt unhappy tenants\nWhen we start when we finished the work they're the super who you know you have to get that the truth the facts from the yeah the ground that's right right so the super tells me I'm having the best time after you finished nobody's complaining I have no clothes everybody's happy\nOf course and then he tells me people are bringing my bill every single day to ask for a pardon me I don't have any I don't have\nAnd that was the fate building had vacancies\nSame building that had vacancies and people same buildings that we were warned about the tenants that they are trouble everything became okay and beautiful and why is that because these people don't feel good about\nThe surroundings mhm they complain about anything and everything as soon as they feel good right everything everything is fine everything's everything's on\n[noise] you know it just so fascinating the way you discuss this that the the RO why you're so critical for let's say a building on her um you know let me ask you let me ask you this question\nA typical business if the interior design is really creative and done right doesn't even help in terms of employee productivity retention or is that or is it only you know let's say when health care where it helps for census\nEveryone wants to work in a good and and nice and comfortable environment\nNobody wants to ... I mean nobody wants to people have to but the productivity and is good feeling that you get\nWhen you work in a nicely done works the work place is is amazing uh I'll tell you another or a give you another example\nWe were working in Westchester on a nursing home mhm um that was it kind of in a remote area was very hard for them to get employees\nAnd their reasoning decorating it was not\nFor employees but they wanted their census too it'd be better and and and that happen anyway\nBut what happened was totally unexpected is one of the nurses that I'd want to invite some of my friends to the grand opening can I Do that and they said sure go ahead and she invited some of her friends they told other people what it looks like\nOff a sudden their employees mile problem they had no problem no problem with people or people young people because they wanted to work there\nI mean because it just being inside the uh the ambiance of that beautiful facility made it so attractive\nAnd nice environment people want to be in a pleasant environment\nNow you mentioned Westchester you use service now Westchester of course is\nNear and it's within the are listening range of WABC that's a that of\nCourse but I I my understanding is you service clients nationwide correct ... how do you do that and I just really more of a a\nOf a question you know how to use the same [laughter] managing projects coast to\nCoast at a you know we really have to travel with our clients if they have facilities or developments of real estate\nIn a different state we we have to we have to do it it is challenging because the the distance um you can be there on a moment's notice\nOr if there was a question it's hard to to answer but you know the technology today right I was a guy thing and that I face time based on meeting if they do that it it can be done it's doable\n[noise] let me ask you like this and I not asking you to share all your trade secrets but just the listeners of mind your business or keep depression remember\nStaying in the top ten and Nielsen ratings is a is no easy feat a and part of the reason why we do that is because they know I asked my guess the tough questions in order to help pick their brain for their great advice and and I appreciate your willingness to do that\nWhat are some of the common designed mistakes that you would say that take place in the workplace that actually hampered productivity\nUm\nTheir common mistakes and there are not so common missed okay um the physical when you approach a project you really need to understand what the work is all about and how they how they process did work\nUm so as I mentioned before if you need constant contact with one of your supervisors\nYou want your office to be near that person mhm otherwise you get distracted and the moment passes and you didn't ask that very crucial question and a mistake or loss occurs\nSo that is in office a workplace really really important the placement lighting on beyond the a good environment I'm In I'm\nIn healthcare also it's it's very crucial first of all you want your um patients to feel comfortable you want them to to feel at home not not in a hospital not in an institutional feeling\nUm many patients we found that don't want to leave the room because they're afraid they're not going to be able to get back\nThey every court or looks the same they don't know where they're going so way finding is very important can you explain that evening they sure um let me give an exam sure I'm a I'm\nA children's um um health care not healthcare a clinic children's clinic don't decide okay I'm with many many doors and many court doors and it looked like a maze very very confusing and I said to myself if I were a child and here I Am putting myself in\nOn your toes the whole time got you're literally [laughter]\nUh and and my my team is so great like I sometimes with forget that maybe we use something it looks middle you're an item and say oh no no no we just use it I said when a week ago so that's it it's absolutely they're not touching it anymore\n[noise] now ... ... ... we touched on this question earlier but I still would like to come back to it now in a slightly different way what are some of the common interior design mistakes that you've seen over the years\nSo a major mistake is when people in this industry followed trends to a tea so if a certain color isn't style you walk into a space and it's all that color\nAnd every other room and every other space is all that color or we've been through a grade trend now and it is sad to see how much gray\nIs used and grace is not a happy color right it's okay to use something that's trendy but balance it with something that is happy\nSo people use trends to without without versatility a that's a huge mistake another mistake is and that has nothing to do with design but is related to design is people are going to project with out a budget and you start something and you have no idea\nWhat the owners project a budget is you're going to run into trouble you gonna be halfway there and you used his money and how we gonna finish so\nIt's a great point to me that a a a a creative from has to be aware of the I call it the runway space you know what what's that budget in place and then\nYou'll work with them in terms of maximizing their availability but if if there if you don't know what that is then you could wind up burning through it and you're done exactly right exactly right [noise]\nI'm going to ask a question now that's a a an interesting question the last time I think I asked it was I mean uh one of the heads of a creative agency that I interviewed a couple of months ago\nAnd that is I I I I Love asking this question also because of the space that we're in what happens when you're presenting something to a client\nAnd you know it's a fantastic now presentation and you know that you're you're mean your head is is wired and it's so that your vision the outcome and you know it's going to be amazing\nBut the the client is pushing back and it's ... I'll say it stayed there being unreasonable like they're just like this is not creative and you know it is how do you how do you navigate that\nSo the best thing is not to tell them\nThey are wrong if if this is their opinion is comes from somewhere so you have to understand that maybe they know something or maybe they're tastes level is not exactly what yours is and you know maybe you didn't even with all the\nUnderstanding that you try to to have before you started project\nSometimes you know the same uh you know in the same page\nSo the first thing is to really have a discussion about what exactly in the total picture is bothering them or they don't like and suggests changes\nAnd the interesting part is when you go through this process with the client nine out of ten times we come back to the original design a fat and they agreed with sales that this is the best way\nBut you have to get out of that but but\nYou have to go through the process and what we also like to do which helps in that I'm used to be choices give at least two or three choices of going to every day because people like to feel that they are in control of what they're doing and they are choosing it\nThey don't see the process we they don't see that we looked at\nFifteen different items before we came up with the perfect one that we feel will fit like a piece in the puzzle but when you give them choices right it helps to make a decision\nI Know he touched on this earlier but I just want to quickly come back to it I'm ... act to interiors and of course you can go visit their website act to interior dot com that's act and the number two interiors dot com\nYou specialize in in design and build and we talked about it that that you oversee the project from start through completion and all the advantages that at all that that does that affords a clients and the fact that it's maintenance free to them\nAnd that you ensure that what you envisioned on the outside and what you present it actually happens and is is executed um\nSo I I I guess the question is I I imagine coast to coast that could be a little challenging or\nIt it is really difficult to do it long\nDistance by the way I don't know if we mentioned that we give the option to the client and they can hire us the design only\nThey uh they can hire us the design and build many people have a relationship with a contractor or a builder ... that they want to maintain we have we really don't have an issue with that we we work with whoever they have in place\nSo when it comes to a long distance we try very hard to\nSuggest that they hire local people right and and we will travel from time to time to oversee the project and communicate with the workers in the field through all the technical out the technical raised that are available to us today and ah this many times good enough\nShift for I Can't thank you for joining me here I'm just an issue in tonight's edition of mind your business any final takeaways for the listeners of the show\nSo I Hope that I was able to convey to oh you're certainly did\nHave to you later is dating pardons yeah of a well designed spaces how it helps in the workplace me how it helps the healing process\nOr how it helps the bottom line which is your ... thank you um and how it improves people's lives where where they live where they work and where they kill\n'em and we feel fortunate that we can have such an impact in people's lives we really feel that we ... we better and we improve\nOr the way people feel about themselves about their productivity and work and about their healing which is a huge huge things so we feel lucky\n... thank you so much for joining me her mind your business as well as we bring this ah addition to a close just want to remind the listeners you could find out more information by going to act to\nInterior dot com that is true for the company back to the number two in here is that Tom if you're friends with the Web site yes we found him on the website and we're very proud of it [noise]\nUm that's thank you [noise] ah well we're at a time stay tuned for a un well actually one of us they threw in fiction for great programming heroin Seventy seven WABC in tune in again next Sunday night for another great addition I mind your business right here on Seventy seven\nThe U.
