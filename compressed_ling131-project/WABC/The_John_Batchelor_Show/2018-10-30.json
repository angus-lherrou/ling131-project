when it comes to their own sense of style and now I've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of Manhattan\nAbsolutely so yes I mean I I Would guess that a journalist who was the chief of police in Kandahar he probably was one of the two prime targets but yeah this attack appears to be well planned\nFor the visit of general Miller US military denies that Miller was a target of this attack the Taliban explicitly stated that both received and Miller where the target of of the attack\nAnd I'm given the fact that a senior America that a brigadier general was wounded during this a fascination I have to believe that the Taliban are are telling the truth on this\nHas there been any indication that they've added their body guards again or that there's a security alert going on whoever has a weapon near senior officers\n[noise] yeah it's a it's a pretty opaque process to us here we don't really get insight on how the Afghans are vetting their member owned members of the security forces [noise]\nUm I have to imagine and you know the risk author is going to talk about how\nMany members of Afghan security forces are going to be treated in the presence because disarming them is a major insult so but I Would have to guess when senior officials and high high level officers are a meeting with Afghan or they're asking ah opposite\nThat the that the security forces will be disarmed or have to leave leave the room\nOr American security forces have to be president kind of a standoff built this yeah this this reminds me of the stories I read it in in\nAbout Vietnam especially after the major withdrawal of Mac V. in Seventy two and then it was transitioning to Vietnam is Asian but always the threat was against the American advisors or the American service personnel because they couldn't be sure\nOr who the good guys and bad guys were in Vietnam Vietnam\nYeah what's ... what's that bond of trust is broken and in this type of infants\nIt's it's really something difficult to to restore when you were if they're going to ask Afghan security forces to disarm during a er during meetings you know again they're insulting their their Afghan host\nAmericans are getting their markets are already in a posture where they have what they call guardian angels these are security forces were specifically assigned with military trainers to watch to make sure that they're that they're a compatriots arts\nShot by Afghan forces so you know it's hard to it's it causes a lot of tension is trust and that is exactly what the Taliban or any evidence insurgency that's worth it so it was to try which is\nA very good evening to your article takes us to the Iran connection a partner nations chic to disrupt us in partner nations seek to disrupt the Iran Taliban nexus\nVicious fresh to me you've established over many many years that Iran is a very active agent with regard to al ... how does that extend to Taliban\nOr getting John you know this is one of those stories it's really underappreciated is that you know you go through some sources will tell you that in starting two thousand one neuron was incredibly helpful with the U.S\nAnd trying to set up a post tall blond government and was basically acquiesce thing to us and international demands and with ... playing a diplomatic and otherwise healthy role in Afghanistan um there is a whole fact pattern which tells the opposite story the dark side of the story which is that in starting in two thousand and one of\nThe ... the Taliban in Iran actually cut an agreement to work against us\nAnd we've documented this in a numerous times and his most recent action taken by the U.S and six partner nations in his terrorism taskforce\nWas meant to disrupt the finances are that are that this the heart of this nexus between Iranian actors and the Taliban specifically\nUm to officials who worked for Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and six tall bought officials in addition to a major drug

the capital or they're looking to make whether they're always looking to make money what is their chief interest in Afghanistan\nWhile they're cheap interest in Afghanistan is to get the U.S out and to expand their own interest now you know where people go awry on this story is they correctly remember that the Iran and the Taliban were at odds were at loggerheads in the late Nineteen nineties\nIn Nineteen Ninety eight there were even at the on the verge of war against one another and some people leave off of that story and think that that's the end of the relationship between the two but as we've documented that wasn't the end of the relationship between the two in fact there was the governor of the ... province which is the western most province\nIn Afghanistan around the border with Iran was a guy named ...\nWho was an emissary from ... and he was eventually detained to Guantanamo and was one of the five senior Taliban officials who was traded for Bowe Bergdahl\nWill care costs case file is incredibly interesting because it it came to light that in fact he had brokered a deal on behalf of the tall bond\nWith Iran to come after us in two thousand one there after now this latest action if you read it very carefully by the U.S Treasury Department and he's six partner nations actually gives you a lot of details and what happened after that initial deal is caught between a tall been neuron you see that they're actually a series of arrangements they came that were\nBroker between the two to come after us I'm including in two thousand six two thousand seven and again

last hours this is just put up\nThe president said it is necessary to strengthen the mission and concentrate preparation for fighting a war\nIs looking at the south China Sea and Taiwan Strait\nThe president said we need to tell the president of China president for life of China Xi Jinping ... need to talk all complex situations into consideration and make emergency plans accordingly set the president\nWe have to step up combat readiness exercises joint exercise and confrontational exercises to enhance servicemen its capabilities and preparation for war that would be a headline when the man who is president for life of a billion plus people and a two million plus military\nPreparation for war the defense minister whose job it is to exercise these indications sad if someone tries to separate Taiwan from China the Chinese armed forces will take action at any price the defense minister said the islands in the south China Sea have long been China's territory\nWrong there the legacy of our ancestors and we can't afford to lose a single injure them\nGarden there is no ambiguity here this reads very poorly in English and I'm going to a guest it reads very poorly in every language it's being translated into who's the audience for this garden who is way talking to who is she talking too good evening to\nA good evening John and that is um\nI don't know what's inside of fusion pig's head but there are many potential audience is sort of for instance we could actually be an audience because they want to intimidate us to not defend Taiwan\nIt could very well be people in Taiwan to say you've got to surrender but I think the primary audience is the one at home and the reason is that he is trying to gird um the Chinese political system and to make sure that he's got support in the military\nGot to remember that ... has been purging military officers recently and I'm sure that doesn't go down to well in some parts of the military and so what do you need to do is he needs to bind the fighting for us together and I think that these types of statements play very well because you've got some flag officers and you've got some colonels\nWho just really want to go out and kill people and so this is going to be popular politically you know John one thing I should mention is that we've heard similar statements during a period of when Hu Jintao was the Supreme Ruler\nBut China was more stable than right now the political system I think is in flux and so when we hear statements like this we shouldn't fluff it often say oh we heard that ten years ago I think now we've got to pay particular attention to what they're saying when they're saying\nThat is a garden you mentioned the president for life has been purging the military on what pretenses even doing that\nWell he's been doing it on on the basis of corruption which is the same pretense that he's been using 'em to go after civilians\nBut as we know in the civilian arena um as in true of senior military officers basically they're all corrupt so this is not a question about corruption is a question of going after political enemies\nBecause we've seen this that feeds from paying in the civilian arena has not going after his friends and he's not going after his friends in the military there\nAnd he's not going after his family um and in the civilian arena he's going after anti corruption campaigner so the only conclusion that you can draw from this is that this is a political purge in the civilian area\nAs well from a military puzzle garden ten years ago the Chinese military was aspirational it's no longer aspirational it's actionable\nThat that maneuver against the Decatur was a threat we can do more we can open fire\nThe time that's happened two weeks ago the Taiwan Strait exercise by the anti them and uh the the by the early ... class and the missile forget that was to demonstrate that we we embrace Taiwan we do now\nThe knowledge your claims on Taiwan the Chinese military is not capable of shooting back I don't think that was that was ten years ago they they hadn't stolen enough to do that now\nI don't know garden I Can't tell if these words are boasting or hollow I Can't tell and if I Can't tell how does the navy town\nYou know the that's an important point on the circumstances of change and so um the Chinese are actually feeling their oats and you're going to remember siege in pain 'cause the institutionalized the Communist Party\nWhich means that the rules that were meant to keep leadership in check are no longer there which means that the ... King I'm is subject to no holds barred retaliation\nWhich means siege and paying realizes that he's got very little um that he can't do plan B\nSo if he seemed to back down he's going to lose power he's going to lose freedom he could lose his life\nThis is going back to Maoist era political struggles and what's teaching thing has done is he's increase the cost of losing a political struggle he knows that which means he can take China over the edge if he thinks he's going to die anyway he might as well ... half of humanity doing it if he thinks he's got a chance to survive\nSo that's what makes this different than Hu Jintao who was this middle of the road bureaucrat who you know it was just going to get along and play along and let everyone be happy things are very different now\nMost respected us force [laughter] it's sunny so do you have these [noise]\nYou know football baseball [noise]\nFamous [laughter]\n[noise]\nHi it's Rena Cosby from Curtis and Cosby did you know the best time to love your family\nAnd group holiday travel is now\nFor all of your hotel need look no further than hotel plan or ... pounds a day or number one and group traveled plus they have a free event planning service to\nMake sure your trip his seem less hotel minor dot com is sure to get you the best rain during the busy holiday season color didn't dare travel planning experts at hotel planner dot com today to ensure the death rates around the world\nIf you plan on selling or buying a home listened to this important message rex real estate is selling homes in New York for two percent total that's right only two percent not be outrageous six percent traditional real estate agents charge saving ... on average twenty five thousand dollars is a\nFully license brokerage rex lists on top of real estate website slugs Zillow truly\nA and street easy rex uses advance digital marketing strategies to find qualified buyers for your home to see if you qualify\nCalled five one six to one seven eight five nine nine\nFive one six to one seven eight five nine nine\nJoined dedicated rex team handles everything from photography and open houses all the way to negotiating offers and closing paperwork\nIf you want to pay just two percent you've got to sell your home with rats to see if you're qualified call five one six to one seven eight five nine nine five one six to one seven eight five nine nine which is like this brokerage must have never wants to what they want to see what's at what\nMore can cause Gordon Chang stays with us from the Daily Beast and we're joined by the freebie can build guard bill is written extensively of Chinese capabilities over many many years decades\nAnd he's watched the Chinese develop their skill set and their confidence and their arrogance\nTowards targets in the United states\nThree letters to remind you O.

election and be on good evening to\nOh hi John always good to be on the show well first off a the the twenty two million federal records that were stolen by the Chinese and the opium hack\nUh are now being used with advanced or artificial intelligence software\nTo actually conduct major information operations whether that is targeting a network administrators who they want to have further or to conduct a election meddling operations as the vice president revealed a couple of weeks ago\nGarden ville I understand that trying to put more money into trying to influence the American electorate than any other foreign power but it hasn't done what the Russians have done which is the troll farms in the box\nThey've I've heard actually put the infrastructure in place but not implemented it what do you think that they've done\nWell I think uh I I got a hold of this first of all the vice president mentioned that there was a nice internal\nChinese party propaganda notice\nWhich basically outlined a what I Would describe as an information warfare campaign\nTargeting ah the United states and king off of the trade war which they are clearly engaged in there they're making no bones about it uh this propaganda notice I found it online the White House referred me to a just a quote briefly from it it said\nWe must carefully control or propaganda tone not to escalate not to expand the scope instead we must fire precision strikes we must ship a soda scored among different groups in the United states and make them collapse so that kind of gives you a sense of where the Chinese are going with is\nThat is how do they mean bill collapse what is the nature of that a goal\nThey're they're basically targeting the trade issue so that's kind of the main focus a their feel like they believe that the Trump administration's effort to pressure China is\nPart of an anti communist drive to prevent China from rising they they view within ideological Cold War terms despite them saying that accusing the United states of having a Cold War mentality as part of their propaganda\nBut are clearly they want to prevent the United states from succeeding in in the tariff war and clearly they're under pressure uh there are important signs that their struggles within the Chinese leadership over\nTo respond to this pressure the economic pressure that the Trump Administration has imposed so I think the u._s. is winning and they're going to try every way they can to defeat Trump a bar by or perhaps in the mid term elections coming up next week they're trying to\nAh prevent that the Republicans for maintaining control and hopefully working through the Democrats to to further undermine Trump's policies towards China\nThat's a positive bill or their America desk I'd like to ask a question here what what is where does your education to think that Nancy Pelosi as speaker is going to be pro China I don't see any evidence that that's accurate nor do I see any evidence that controlling the house of representatives is going to change Donald Trump's mind about trade conflict\nWell or they want to be able to go after Trump in every which way they can and of course uh there's no question in my mind that if the Democrats take over the house I don't think they will but if they do they're going to try to impeach a Trump\nTheir eyes so they want to get the Chinese are gone for the big one they're going to the old twenty fifth version three\nYes that either halfway measure and then uh pets are revealed in his speech that uh it's not limited to this year's election they're going after Trump in twenty twenty so they're going to find and support\nA pro China businessmen who are going to support pro China politicians in the Democratic party to follow Beijing's long garden\nVille I think you know as as John indicated um that's not going to be really smart plan because there are number of pro China politicians are equally divided between the two parties and if there's a balance there's going to be more in the Republican Party but putting that aside for the moment\nWhat do you think the United states should do to counter the electioneering on the part of ... ah they\nHave to be made to pay a price and so far they're not paying a price there there are some economic measures the terrorists are are part of it I think there has to be political\nUh efforts made a using U.S intelligence to expose some of the leadership corruption a there are people in a in this country and I can think of one of the top of my head a of a dissident Chinese billionaire named ...\nWho has the details on the corruption of all if not all but many of the top Chinese leaders and their foreign holdings uh their foreign corruption\nAnd it's endemic to that system and I think that U.S intelligence should be task to expose some of that but let's make those people pay a price let's let's show the Chinese people how corrupt the Communist Party leadership\nReally is twenty seconds dies quickly do require coordination among several branches in United States government to see that happening bill [noise]\nUm I think it's possible I certainly do I think a after the

[laughter] you know that's introducing the most advanced sleep surface ever created them my pillow mattress top of the masses which are gone by the way is awesome guarantees you the most wonderful deep healing sleep of your life some my fellow mattress offers made of three layers that will transform\nUnimaginable act which is now not someone imaginable I think it doesn't even stand alone as much as it deserves to stand alone as part of the middle you and and I think that's why so many people are concerned and sort of perplexed and and and all that\nJohn David makes an excellent point that the attack in Pittsburgh has just continuous with the other incidents because of the horror of it it was an attack on innocent people and at the same time you can join with what the us has enjoyed for Seventy years which is\nSpeaking how ah how well the U.S has welcomed Jewish refugees from the euro pars and here we have one visited upon us is beyond irony John it ... it reminds all of us that you have to be a watchful every day\nWell I Know several ex patriots who are Americans but live overseas and they come back to this country perhaps once a year and talking to them as a real eye opener because they see the country of snapshot form and they know inches over the course of a year or two\nWhat I've been told by many of them the last two or three years is is how much more politicized America is how people are yelling at each other about politics that no longer discuss\nYou know the normal course of daily events they immediately jumped into politics and they find out who starred someone is on and they start attacking them social media has become a mosh pit of resentments and prejudices and name calling\nSo one of the greatness of the great things about America for much of my life has been we don't dedicate everything to politics politics is sort of cordoned off\nPeople carve up their lives separate from it I think the age of Trump the age of clip from the age of the shouting into the yelling has meant more people are getting more upset with each other than they ever have before and that ultimately has consequences\nThat is you have a question for you know the gentleman there or not or they're not deep divisions among people use the country in the direction the country's going to lead to this and how do you uh mealy or eight or the rhetoric amongst both sides when that chasm exists David [noise]\nWell I think part of the problem is nobody wants to say except responsibility for anything you know the president is never fall for anything he says the a leading figures on the left or never fall for anything they say\nSo everybody says whatever they want and it's always the other guy's fall and if nobody is willing to collectively take responsibility for things things that aren't necessarily their fault but in a sense\nAre their fault if they're an elective office because otherwise why are you there than nothing is going to get better I think it is true that we are deeply divided nation and that is that a\nA character of our politics increasingly over the past Twenty years I think what's different now\nThan at least in some previous decades although this isn't the only time in American history this has happened\nIs that at the present time where particularly tribal about it we are with our political try because the other side of the evil so my side might not always the right but the other side is evil they're not just wrong they have ill intent and we have seen\nIn both the left in the right described president they don't like is not just being wrong but purposely wrong for the purpose of undermining America on purpose\nAs though political leaders actually said to themselves when I get up in the morning left or right today I'm going to ruin America on purpose for what purpose I had no idea that people believe that\nJohn I'm both sides believe that the America that they want is threatened\nAnd we have seen the last Thirty years the percentage of people who believe that the other party is evil as David described has gone from about forty twenty percent of Republicans and Democrats used to believe that about the other party\nNow it's fifty two fifty three percent for each party you cannot have a functioning democracy cannot have a Congress\nThat compromises and passes bipartisan legislation you cannot have anything like the old politics we have over half of the country\nBelieves the other side is exactly what David said I'd met at a domestic ah enemy or an enemy of the people um those those are not conditions under which you can govern the way we used to\nA question Richard Haass that are raised in an article you wrote in Nineteen fifty this was during the McCarthy period when there were deep divisions in America\nAnd I paraphrase it just loosely because I Want to ask the question about that David do you measure that Washington today is prepared for the opponent to be the government\nOur men and women going to work on Capitol Hill and at the White House aware of the fact that the people there are posing tonight on television could very well be the leadership of the country in a matter of months\nWell I think\nI think that for political professionals in Washington they know that very well but they have a part to play and they play the part and then the election happens and they go about their ... they kind of go about their business so I think that when you're in this business you say all sorts of things\nAnd then you're able to work together the next day because that's just your job I think the problem with that is that you create expectations among the electorate ... that make\nIt harder for them to be okay with you doing that job so for instance if you if you go on television call one party\nEvil they're trying to undermine America or or you beat up on the political establishment and the government and and create a sense of distrust among institution then when it's time to actually do your job\nWell your professional so for you it's no big deal but for voters they're sitting there going but I don't trust the government and you said the other side of the evil so I don't want you to compromise with them\nAnd and I don't think that I I don't know the political leaders of digested or talking heads and digested but they create this or that they might not necessarily believe and think it's all part of\nYou know you're in the middle of a football game and then when it's over your friends again but for the fans they still have the other side's fans and they don't want you to make nice with them and I I don't know if people quite a internalized that\nJohn do ... are the professionals ready to acknowledge the other side is in charge and work with them\n[noise]\nWell we're going to find out because if the Democrats take back the house a that would give them the responsibility of governance\nAnd we can see if we have a normal Congress where there's a give and take and you know people debate whether or not to have a government shutdown and what the how to stop that and pass appropriations bills and all of those things out of the Ghost Ship with a Republican Senate\nOr we can go to every democratic chairman issues lots of subpoenas halls and members of the administration for questioning\nAnd rules to impeachment remember the leading democratic donors\nThat it will have elected a lot of these House Democrats Tom Steyer specifically in California\nDid so say we want to impeach President Trump so the expectations that David spoke about are going to be there if the Democrats take back the house they will have a choice\nDo we govern normally having you know have won the election or do we are we driven by our donors in our part is that our base to you know full frontal war with the administration and there's no pretense of governing\nJohn Fund of the national Review Online and Fox News David ...

[noise] [noise]\nI'm John ... this is the John ... we're\nThe sanctions on Iran because of the suspect nuclear weapons\nThe sanctions will crush what is left of the Iranian economy chiefly to do with banking rules and the ability of Iran to do business with the rest of the world and also have money that has substance it's collapsed over these last week\nInside Iran however we are not making more on the Iranian people this is to do with a regime gang and this gang hold everyone hostage in Iran and out making war on its neighbors it's a predatory state because of this gang\nThe con is a senior Iran analyst at the foundation for the defense of democracy\nAnd it is a great help that he and his colleagues now publish a list of twelve names of Iranian gangsters these are some of the men in command maybe up to thirty forty years since their youth\nWho persecute the people of Iran ... the people of the neighborhood who persecute everyone across the middle east with their idea of revolution which is another word for theft\nSee a very good evening to thank you for this the Trump Administration is lowering sanctions so what was your inspiration to be very particular about who it is that is the ... who is the problem good evening to you\n[noise] good evening a thanks for having me\nUm well I Would say this report that I'm a that we're discussing is coming about a week before the Trump Administration uh renews the rest of the economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted up under the two thousand and Fifteen a nuclear deal and uh that's what I think that these this is a\nVital stop I think it will go a long way towards pressuring the regime or an exerting a fairly devastating impact on US Economy but I think as we do this it's also a very important that we also go after the figures in the regime that are responsible for major human rights abuses\nOf the Trump Administration as well as their mission before him a had already um sanctioned a number of such people\nBut there are many more within the regime that have yet to be a designated for human rights abuses and I think it's very important that we do so now also because the Iranian people are um protesting as we speak on the rich are on the streets of Iran as they've been doing since late two thousand ah Seventeen\nAnd uh they're looking I think many of them are looking to the United states for leadership for solidarity\nOr they were a member of the fact that President Obama was largely silent when they first protested a mass scale in two thousand nine or ... and I think that by sanctioning these people I think we're also sending a much more a direct message to the Iranian people that we understand the particular place that\nThey experience on a day to day basis um and these are figures which um you know these aren't obscure figures within Iran many of them were actually appointed by president Hassan Rouhani who is often described as a moderate\nUm but in fact when you actually look at his behavior\nUm UCLA he actually um\nI was appointed officials who are directly who\nPrior to the appointment we're responsible for major human rights abuses\nAnd they have continued um since then so um these are people who report to Rowhani so we can't uh plausibly argue that um he has no responsibility for this or that he's powerless to prevent it um the these are figures within the regime that a\nA ... that operates daily I'm apparatus of repression\nThe report is entitled profiles of Iranian repression architects of human rights abuses in the Islamic republic it's available at the foundation for the defense of democracy the website\nI'm going to look to breaking down there twelve names here but and they're all unfamiliar to me before I come to the profiles provided in the report so we'll begin with the ministers\nA mock mood a lobby is the minister of intelligence or he is a severe abuser of the Iranian people at the same time he says his job is to stand up to the cronies of global hedge me had Joni meaning the United states\nHow is the minister of intelligence used internally against the Iranian people say\nWell the mystery of intelligence is probably a\nArguably probably one of the most uh it's not the most major human rights abuses or a in a Iran\nUm it has its fingerprints on throughout the country in terms of uh targeting dissidents journalists a political activists ethnic and religious minorities or you name it on the ministry of intelligence is job is to monitor dissidents monitor opponents\nOf the regime a and I had a pretty extensive infrastructure uh aimed at doing so um it's probably the minister of intelligence is probably one of the most important\nMinisters I'm In the regime um and I think they've also I Would notice they played a key role in suppressing um the protests are through force that have occurred um over the last year they actually operate their own um\nPrison wardens are within Iran ... infant is a prison ... infrastructure um so uh you know when these people are sent to prison you know they ... they play a direct role\nUm in torturing these people and extracting a force confessions an otherwise mistreating them in many ways I'm sick of this is one of the most a brutal ministries and the regime\nThe ministry of interior Abdul ... what is striking about this is that he manages the the L E s a who is ... and what is the L. A. F. C.\nA society as the minister of interior and the ... that stands for the Islamic ... the law enforcement force of the Islamic republic of Iran or at least it's basically the official state police um they're responsible in theory for\nHe is every team Ross the what do we know about his background and how does he connected Nineteen eighty eight\n[noise] will in Nineteen eighty eight or the Iranian regime uh perpetrated I think when it's ... arguably the single\nBloodiest atrocity in its history a against its own uh people are and this was a coordinated systemic effort to massacre a thousands of a\nPolitical opponents um throughout the country Iran a stop ... death panels which were three member commissions a which had the ...\nWhich were responsible for sentencing or individual uh these people to death or\nThese panels were often um cannot be described as any serious a legal effort a these are often they would interview people for for a few minutes um and on the basis of several minute interview would decide whether or not they would live or die and Abraham right you see\nA was one of the members of those\nA death panels I'm associate directly has a responsibility for a scores of deaths um and today he presides over a foundation um called Austin customers Avi a which plays a key role in generating\nUm the money that helps a Iran a ... a\nA deport a support terror abroad or as well as repression I'm at home um this is a foundation that set with a real estate value you know in the range of a hundred million dollars um and um\nThe fact that he occupies a such an important role in the regime I think is very uh telling 'em because I really just shows um that the regime a really doesn't particularly care about a\nHuman rights abuses on on the contrary um he was promoted I think not in spite of his bloody record but because of it\nUm because it showed a his loyalty to the regime and to the radical Islamist ideology that tribes so so he is I think one of the most important figures and arguably one of the most dangerous as well and the regime\nBrigadier general huffing ... he is in charge of the law enforcement force L. E. F. that includes cyber I Believe and it overlaps with the siege how does he make warn people\nWell the police is responsible for us suppressing dissent um the police or you know routinely um arrests those um it's it's the suspects of defying the regime whether we're talking about a journalist human rights activists religious minorities\nEt cetera and I think the police has also over the last year played a key role in uh arresting and otherwise using force against Iranian protesters so this is I said I think that's one so that ... law enforcement forces is one of the most important bodies\nI'm of the government responsible for attacking suppressing its own people\nCommander the siege goes ... guy in power and vote for and the puzzle here is we don't know how big the messages you I've estimates from a hundred thousand to five million what's a what's a good guess\nWhat we're talking about we're talking about I'm In the millions and this is actually largely a volunteer force that has branches a throughout the country and it's fairly imbedded within the daily fabric of the Iranian life\nNow there may be several million but we're not talking about is a fairly a\nSeveral million who are active day to day um those are are you know are we talking about a bit of a smaller number um but what makes the um\nThe siege distinct from the police is it not only do they um suppress dissent but they're in particular\nThey pay a particular role in enforcing the religious norms of the regime and I think the most dramatic and most well known example of that over the last two years has been a the suppression of Iranian women particularly those women who refused to where the hit job or the head scarf or in public\nI'm refusing to where the headscarf is a crime that can land you in jail or in Iran and in fact\nThat's precisely what's happened over the last year when many women um refused to wear their head scarf in public as a as a as a form of\nProtest and uh they wind up in jail um other things that the uh the siege or does as they try to prevent a let's say male female ... station I'm having a party where men and women are present a together a can easily land you in jail\nAnd a siege is one of the main forces responsible for ensuring that happens so um this again is another dangerous uh organization I'm within the regime and its ... particularly important role in the religious enforcing the religious norms of of the government\nAnd two judges or one name ... the the other one name ... say you say there are hanging judges is that what they do what do they do today\nYeah these two judges are among the most infamous judges or any Ron I'm they probably had a responsible for war um unjust sentences in the judiciary and the judicial system than probably I'm almost anyone else\nI'm ... I'm I think became particularly more well known in the west back in two thousand nine when he actually presided over the public trials of hundreds of Iranian protesters um\nSince then um you know he's continued to work as I mentioned about the judicial system earlier um this is a system where trials can often last minutes um uh lawyers are access to lawyers are limited\nFor non existent and I'd also highlights ... because he is actually played a key role in um sentencing\nA number of dual nationals I'm In Iran including several I'm Iranian American citizens um the regime has a particular interest and capturing these people because for the obvious reason in that regard that the United states has its at her adversary\nAnd when Iranian goes ahead and gets a un American citizenship that's obviously something that deeply troubles the regime so when\nThese people come back home and they often have a strong chance of getting arrested and in those cases um\nThey often get sent to a solid body um\nAnd they get sent him because they know the regime knows that he is going to deal with them I'm very harshly so when the river the regime wants to make an example of somebody or he's or go to guy and he usually doesn't disappoint them because these are folks that end up I'm\nSpending a long time in prison or where they frequently face torture 'em and oh and by the way I'm\nMany much of the time um you'll often hear that these people have confessed to their crimes are so to speak but in fact as we know and as many prisoners have reported um these ... these ah\nConfessions so called confessions are coerced under torture often um so when we hear about you know these ... that Iranians are ... ah but they've done wrong to the regime we have to keep in mind that ah it's likely a violent a confession that wasn't delivered voluntarily\nThe document is profiles of Iranian ...\nWe've we've talked about nine of the twelve names there's also the minister of communication there's the matter is in charge of the prison other bad actors it's produced by the foundation for the defense of democracy I've been speaking with C Conn he's a senior\nIran analyst stairs fall word abide or the author is well Dr ... shot heat or is it forward by the author rose Harris director and a forward by the author professor or when consular as well I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nJohn last you know my longtime economy ... on the website and the\nKind of falling in love [noise] dollars five dollars for a monthly subscription or twenty five dollar donation\nIs a man I I Want to thank your listeners for their remarkable generosity by the black it's really [noise] most welcoming Bob I'm John ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm things have gotten worse and worse between more tense between a local uh Indians and the Dutch settlers\nOver issues having to do with keeps attempt to tax them\nOr to raise revenues are over the issue of land settlement as more and more Dutch\nFarmers spread out from lower Manhattan into the surrounding countryside uh and and and clashed with local Indians living there\nAre in ... ah I I think you have to say stupidly or short sided Lee um opens up a Pandora's box by launching repeated attacks are against Indian peoples in the area\n[noise] um this results in in German warfare the whole the whole a conflict is known as Keith's war really last on and off for almost five years in the early uh sixteen forties a tragic very very sad sequence of events\nUh the Indians retaliate against outlying Dutch settlements um lives were lost on both sides settlements are are are burned to the\nGround [noise] um and um you know the one thing that I tried to point out in the book is uh that\nWhen we think about the road to wounded knee to the final bank pushing the American Indians and Eighteen Ninety in the far west the road to indeed knee starts in New York harbor just as much as it started in the Chesapeake\nAnd in Massachusetts Bay which also had Indian conflicts and the seventeenth century between English settlers and local Indians um and uh you know I grew up in New York City and was never taught this uh in school um it's it's a it's a phase of\nUh the early colonial history of New York that really until perhaps more recently that I was in school anyway uh was was kind of a race from the textbooks erased from consciousness\n'em and you know that's really one of the reasons I wrote this book was to restore our ah awareness of a lot of the military history of New York's the New York city area that uh that were on aware of or I forgotten\nHere come the Concord because in sixteen sixty four the king of England uh and his brother both lay claim to some of the territory that the Dutch claim to the north there is a treaty the Hartford treated there is an invasion between New England and the ducks here in New York however that doesn't satisfy maddening Nicholas shows up with a war fleet\nAuthor of port Amsterdam\nOr then directed by Peter diamonds and he gives them an ultimatum and Stuyvesant think certainly might as well surrender and is that the end of the Dutch with one little episode in future that's the end of the ... in Manhattan that moment right\nAnd that's ... why things don't fight an overwhelming force\nThat is correct a Stuyvesant has a hard time coming to that conclusion\nBecause she is a real soldier he's he's a man who came up through the ranks of the Dutch west India company\nUm he's he is chief successor as governor basically director of the colony\nBut he had fought the Spanish on behalf of the Dutch and the Caribbean prior to his arrival in Manhattan Island so he's a guy a real a real Marshall a temperament he's a very capable administrator a far far far more so than gifted men\nUm but he does ultimately face reality is that he's got a little for with a few hundred\nOr a settlers a couple of hundred militia men and soldiers that he can he can muster and yet he's face is facing not only a flotilla of English or warships\nA manned by sailors and soldiers but he's also got the problem that if he looks across the East River to the shore of ah where where really the Brooklyn Bridge is now today um he's got a whole he's facing a whole\nA mob of ah English farmers\nFrom the far reaches of Long Island who also want to hand over uh the Dutch territory to ah to the king of England so he wisely as you said a decides not to fight\nAnd a and from then forward a Dutch New Amsterdam becomes English New York there was a brief moment as you mentioned in sixteen Seventy three Seventy four the Dutch sailed back\nIn and take over again but then they handed back to the English during peace negotiations and sixteen Seventy four so you end up having New York as a as a port city of the British Empire\nEmpire but the umpires now tangle for the next and sixteen eighty four to Seventeen sixty three a series of wars cheaply fought between the French and English and

Greeks out in the middle of a turkey\nSo they were at war with Greece and they just trusted the people who were Greek who lives\nOn the punches and they evacuated them or they for some evacuation and that was what you present plenty of evidence that that was a cover up for the fact that this was a massacre ongoing and it was what we would call them the twenty first century and ethnic cleansing is that an appropriate term for this\nI suppose so it's also called the Greek genocide and what would happen to shovel stages this was the last stage of it a and a yes or certainly that was what it appears a general who was in charge was a very brutal man here apparently been sent by Mustafa come out to um\nTo uh take charge and two are in fact a classified oh area and he regarded that is to get rid of all the ... military age normally by massacre and then to send the others are women or children old man a\nInland on deportations to the interior of but in fact uh these deportations turn out to be massive death marches\nUh this information was reported back to admiral breasts\nNow the controversy here is did the admiral follow these anecdotes he resisted\nThe opinion that the Armenian massacre was one side and I believe he wanted to follow the idea that this was a civil war and that both sides were committing ... but when he's being told about these evacuations in the contest and that they're associated with\nA ... a a ... the ... the ... national is does he believe in\nUm he actually did he was eventually forced to believe it eventually says I think he said he is quoted as saying and one of his letters I saw one of those letters where he says\nI think there's no question that they have that the Turks have wiped out all the villages throughout the region and some people inland uh there's no question that eventually he did and part of the reason for that was to destroy our captains who put it to him and the most from way that if we don't do something will be like the Germans during World War one\nIn which they said nothing about what was happening to do the Armenians\nRight so are there is a wonderful story you tell about the Compton's Carl Compton from Canada\nThe Greek women and children and families are running in the middle of the night they can hear the screaming they hear the burning of these towns where they live by\nThe Americans and they're often they're missionaries are teachers that colleges stay inside their compounds they know not to get out they hear shooting and people come over the wall and they're given shelter by the Americans\nThe Compton's help one Greek family a lot of families disappear into the\nUh into the interior and they don't know whether they've been killed or whether they've gotten away successfully but I think you're right that six years later the Compton's hurt when one of the family members Ruth I think she died and they heard from the family\nAnd they got a letter ... were you able to contact the family who wrote the Compton Bob\nI Know I was not able to about a certainly they had always treasured ah the Compton's because they had hoped to them and survive many uh many then stayed on college grounds", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "30"}
