land masses that occupy that vast amount of water we call the Pacific ocean and he's here to help me understand the new navy and the challenges ahead we'll begin with a welcome to the under secretary he's a graduate of the Naval Academy Nineteen eighty three\nHe flew the U H one in which Tom tells me is the Huey he flew it\nFor the fleet and he's now a helping the fleet understand what it needs for the future especially the people in the fleet there is a speech that Tom gave to the U.S Naval Academy graduating class this year and it's available on YouTube\nFor all of these will understand the navy it's a pleasure to watch a speech to young people\nTrying restless in their seats in the hot sun trying to imagine what leadership is going to be like well gentleman leadership is what Tom looks like because he was once in those seats and now he's the under secretary\nTom a very good evening to you thank you for this I Begin with the puzzlement what does it mean that you are now the chief management officer of the department of the navy good evening to you too\nThank you John and thank you so much for having me on your show I'm a great admirer of your of you and your format and so it's a it's an honor for me to be here um but to explain the my position as the chief management officer of the navy this is something that the Congress are placed in the last several years ago and it actually had its genesis\nOr in the early two thousand when I was here before is the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management and the Congress was looking at ways to to assert the management leadership of the department\nAnd the political or in the political appointees and they struggled with how they would do that um because there are so many that the way the razor responsibilities for\nFolks in these positions is pretty broad and they want to ensure that somebody at a senior levels in each of the military departments or what have someone responsible for managing the business operations to include\nBusiness transformation business systems modernization\nThe things that many of the things that the private sector has gone through and the last ten or Twenty years with respect to modernizing how they do business\nImplementation of technologies a streamlined supply chains and things like that if they weren't if they wanted to try to elevate leadership for that or to the most senior level as possible and the department and so they they designated each of the service under secretary says achieve management officers for their service\nAnd they also created a new position in the department of defense called the ah she'd management officer of the department of defense you also have that responsibility generally for the overall DOD enterprise\nSo what you're looking at is a treating the challenges of the ... the way international companies do to assemble their products and sell it and watch it in and we interact with their customers in your case the customers are the people of the United states so in general are you taking on a task that is\nA that is ongoing or you inventing this for years the first time I remember being told that the U.S department of defense has never been audited is that accurate\nThat is the entire department has not been audited has a department that is happening right now that is one of my responsibilities as achieve management officer and one of the things that the Congress was looking at traditionally the audit function and the Arctic readiness function has been driven out of the chief financial officer position\nUm but one of the things that I've done in the navy is elevated to my position because it's more than just a financial management problem or challenge\nIt's an enterprise wide challenge particularly when you have business systems in IT that span\nAcross a variety of functions from Personnel Management\nA logistics supply chain they all have different environments and almost every decision that may that is made in those environments has a financial application that needs to be traceable and accountable to the taxpayers so that's really what uh so the the audit right now that we're we're undergoing is for the first time\nThe department of defense or writ large is going through a\nDepartment wide financial management audit or each of the services ... has hired a different audit for him to do that um and we're on that path right now and those results should be out in the November timeframe yes\nYou were in the navy and then you transition I think that's the polite word that the navy uses from wearing a uniform to not wearing uniforms being in the reserves and you were added an audit firm price Waterhouse I Believe so yes this is calling upon your skill set that you learned after navy\n[noise] um I Would I ... I Would say that's true in some sense and and I noticed that when I when I left the navy I actually worked in the private sector doing corporate mergers and acquisitions\nUm both in the aerospace industry as well as in a in IT Services so I gained some experience there and then when I came back to the department after nine eleven for a short stand about five years I really got steeped into understanding what the ... the management and business challenges were and the D O D\nWhich I then when I went to price Waterhouse Coopers then was doing that with clients both here and internationally I was the global defense leader for the firm and so I Would travel around the world speaking to other militaries about some of the management challenges that they had and it's interesting that there really aren't very many militaries\nAnd defense establishment and the world that uh for which the United states has a good comparison because we're so much larger than everybody else\nBut it was a fascinating a time for me because what I think I learned is that a lot of these smaller countries who have for our very risque or resource constrained\nHave become a lot more creative and I think we have become in terms of how we manage business um and so there are a lot of those types of lessons that I'm trying to to bring here to the navy\nI Want to apply this to a real time concept which is a naval education\nIf I talk all the time to the Naval War college I in fact in fact I spoke to professor Jim homes last night about the Decatur incident and I learned a deal talking the Naval War college\nIt's a it's a pleasure because that is that's the that's the ideas of the navy for the last hundred years there's also the Naval Academy where you spoke so how does a lot of ability or\nA clean sheet review I think that's a technical got technical term how does that apply to the institutions educational ... and the navy\nWell John I think that that at the end of the day uh are competitive advantage I think in this\nCountry is always going to be um our ability to outflank our adversaries or whether that's in a business\nGo to get by US DOT com and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network one hundred percent phenomenal\nNow back to the John bachelor show even when\nJohn ... Thomas mostly as the under secretary of the United States Navy and his task right now as chief management officer is to put all the death in a line however the the fleet is not so need as a classroom and I read a deal about the challenges of the fleet most recently\nWhen an incident in spradley islands where the ... class distorted USS Decatur was challenged recklessly by worship of a near peer review of a fellow I think that's one way of putting it\n... times the fleet the president when he was a candidate and now during his first Eighteen months of his administration has talked about a fleet of three hundred and fifty five ships I understand\nThat that is a big number and inside that we're making decisions so I Want to concentrate on the surface warfare right now due right now I have a vision of where the Navy's going\nFor dealing with for example the first time and change and the second island chain in the Pacific in the theoretical problem of\nAn anti access area denial weapons in the Pacific does the navy have a vision of where it wants to go Tom your opinion\nYeah I think I think John that we do and we're constantly reassessing that and um which you mentioned the fleet\nA fleet structure analysis that's that's being done right now for fleet structure assessment I'm looking to have some conclusions out of that later this fall um but yeah it's something that they are constantly were constantly looking at mostly this falls in the area of the chief of naval operations and his team to look at that and to understand what that means\nIn reference to your three fifty five number I think if you saw on when I had my swearing in speech where my job I talked about uh that I like to call at three fifty five plus because I think\nWhen we think about what that structure is going to look like I don't think anyone really knows right now specifically a we have some goals in mind but my view is that the that eventually that the plus is going to be more than just\nTraditionally what we think of ships but it will include it will also include a unmanned a lethality um and a lot of the things that will keep our our opponents guessing about what our capabilities might be\nWell I go right to you a ... because my understanding is that the uh the aircraft carriers which are the centerpiece of the gems of the solar system right now they have their wings that are not capable by themselves to extending into the\nUh first island chain or because of the anti access area denial weaponry that the Chinese have developed for example and one answer to that area are you a these are you satisfied that the way the tanker tank or not the na na na na na na platform but the tanker he's going to make all\nThe air the air wings more effective in future\n[noise] well I think that uh I think the decision on M. T. twenty five is that right is the right decision for us for now but understand when you when you develop a technology like that it's at that level of sophistication there always opportunities to build off of that\nUh to develop other capabilities off of off of that and so obviously we're looking at all those types of things as part of this force structure assessment\nClearly the the um our adversaries and that in that region or have developed capabilities that um put the carrier at risk and I as I mentioned I've heard you discuss this with Jerry and I I Know that uh you just published a paper as well\nThat I have a Center for new American security about these very matters yes\nSo I I mean you can't argue with the with the sort of the physics there um but we are looking at a altered ties of opportunities to counter that strategy or to counter that are that capability gap and that's what the force structure assessment will be looking at\nWhat we're what also Tom I'm learning is that the navy is a knowledge center not just sell hardware and software and the challenges now are to recruit and retain\nA the agile minds you talked about before are you are do you have a plan for that to do in ... to ah to in some fashion ... hold on to the people you educate end to have people you've educated come back to you\nJohn it's very it's an interesting point and I always\nI always tend to sort of push back on this concept of ... or retain um because my experience in the private sector particularly working for a large sort of consulting firm\nIs that uh we found that it was more successful to think about people bringing people into a network um because you you basically we have a large ecosystem of people in the national security space\nOr who contribute and variety of different areas from being on a contractor side the research side the academic side as well as operational forces\nAnd in my view is that a yes we want to recruit people we want to train them educate them but um we want to be able to retain them in the ecosystem so we have actually passing laws that allow us to hire people directly from industry now at more senior\nLevels without having to bring the man if you know the old one and some level we can bring them in more laterally\nCommensurate to whatever experiences they have in the private sector and I think those are the types of things you have to\nThink a lot more creatively about uh in order to to build a sort of agile force or this agile ecosystem of human\nCapital a that's going to allow us to be able to compete\nWith us for the moment I'm you graduated in Nineteen eighty three the Reagan Administration into a six hundred sleep\nSix hundred ship Navy I believe something in a big number that I think we're now about two eighty\nA you say to the academy in your speech that you cook a Secretary Mattis I'm your job is to protect the nation your opinion Tom right now you're talking to the moms and dads here are we protecting now with two ways\nWell I think the number is always a an interesting debate at when we when we were driving toward the six hundred ship navy and when I was commissioned in eighty three a John Lennon with the secretary and he was driving us to a six hundred ship navy and it was a ... you know the great things about the ... one of the greatest elements of that particular era was that\nWe had a very very well articulated strategy and it was very little confusion about what\nDirection we were headed um I think that was just fantastic and we did reach six hundred at one point\nBut it was probably about the time when I got out of the navy um what was more important about that I think with the sort of the signal that fat that we were serious um and uh to to our anniversary at that time the Soviet Union that we were serious um and it made them second gas and think hard about\nUm whether or not they were going to be a viable force or to compete against us and ultimately I think they determined that they could not be\nSo I'm ... part of it part of it I think is a is is that there's a huge amount of symbolism and that but also even at the time when we had that in many number of ships out there were still only had about a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty of them out there\nI mean at any one given time are we now have two hundred and eighty five ships but we're still trying to stay and then have that kind of presidents of about a hundred and twenty a hundred and forty hour standing at any one time [noise]\nSo what it's doing is that's putting a strain on that that on that top line number now or much better maintenance were much better at sort of keeping availability our ships are are more reliable but\nWe definitely just need more in order to be able to cover the geography of the nation as required us to cover\nThomas ... is the under secretary of the United States Navy his task is chief management officer of vast vast fleet and all of its attendant personnel moms and dads and the children of and also the serving officers and enlisted man it's a vast China task\nOr however the twenty first century is going to make it very very necessary ... I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as I Am not house early childhood\n[noise]\nCloudy I'm Bob round the stories that we talking about I'm Seventy seven WABC a man is under arrest after being accused of attacking a Patterson teenager with a high powered paintball guns happening Monday Night when I was fourteen year old boy answered his front door\nIsrael killed ten thousand people in the Gaza War when even Hamas spinning claim that claiming Israel bombed hospitals Hamas didn't exactly claim that um it's one thing to see it\nWithin the progressive or establishment\nLet's say with a cause she Cortez also in New York was open the radical but the fact that you have a political ad I'm all like Jula brand somebody who\nUm has to be doing this as a political calculation to me I think this sets off alarm bells I'm ... I'm looking at what's happening in Europe right now especially\nThe transformation that we're seeing also within huge chunks of the u._k. labor party and we do need to ask some questions about whether a Democrat Party is also a trending in that direction in that direction again\nIs clearly the anti Israel camp so I wrote this piece was five reason as a senator\nKirsten Gillibrand is dangerous for Israel and I go through a we had many reasons but we boil down to five um those reasons I ... and to me they're starting\nYeah let's begin the first one because this is about the Democratic party Senator Ben Cardin is one of the ... uh sponsors of the Israel anti boycott act\nIn the government and the Congress and this is to oppose the bbs movement the boycott investment in sanctions movement not a controversy old boy I'm not an opposition not at all and ... was for it before she was against is is that the fact\nOnly was before it actually she was a sponsor when she was one of the sponsors originally I was on the Israel anti boycott act which could it be more straightforward um and then all of a sudden she meets with the ACLU\nAnd then she had a bunch of town halls where you had a radical anti Israel groups showing up lick Jewish Voice for peace led us campaign for Palestinian rights\nAre and they're questioning her about her support for the ...\nAnd then she withdrew so it's not just that she in general with bruises apart she actually withdrew her legislative support from this clear it built up this bill that that couldn't be any more clear on in that it opposes the extremist illegitimate beat the U.S campaign\nThat tries to boycott the single out Israel the only democracy in the middle east the only democracy by the way Kirsten Gillibrand's me two liter where women in the middle east have equal rights whereas the PBS movement doesn't go after or even actually ignores\nThe Muslim women throughout the middle east who are being persecuted so she pulls away from that and then she tried to kind of have it both ways you said that she would support a future bill ... she says that she has some problems with\nUm whether there's some kids on free speech how well actually the Democratic members of a\nA Senate and her colleagues have explained to her this has nothing whatsoever to do with free speech I and also I Know that there's a particular radical of anti Israel radical his name is Raphael ... of\nUm who was associated with jello brands campaign cute one of the founders of if not now which is a radical anti Israel group and also\nAh the founders of Jews for Linda Linda ... who is closely associated with children he takes responsibility for\n... backing off the ... so I don't think it's about free speech clearly she goes to a bunch of town halls where anti Israel protesters couldn't find her about this he says this anti Israel activist says he's behind flipping Gillibrand's on the ...\nSo we have that then of course\nYou have um Gillibrand's provided really critical support at a time off for the Obamas disastrous nuclear deal I'm at a time where you had some key Democrats going both ways wavering\nUm and then junior Brandon supports it and then you have other Democrats um jump on the Obama again the scandal is a very dangerous around nuclear deal bandwagon so she also very much helped\nThere with a deal that beeping town yo of course had to wait so nervous about that ... addresses a joint I'm a ... meeting of Congress to Warren and this is very rare for an Israeli prime minister due to do about his deal\nNo also I'm looking at dealer brands praise open praise\nIn time magazine for anti Israel radical Linda SARS for\nA little of course famously said nothing is creepy or identifying as a and then she claimed that you can't be a feminist and it was ins which again I point to the fact that Israel is the only country I mean I'm tired of Middle East lend us wrestler where women are\nStart by the progressive which essentially thinks his candidacy because they've got\nTo really threatened the Republicans into saying we're going to do a third party again and where we don't care what ...\nWhat could a worked because the Republicans everybody you know with your right hand they weren't they weren't they were not excited one of the reasons why this period gets glossed over in American history\nIs because the Republican convention is so list list so on the floors list list but the machinations going on behind the scenes with T are are fascinating TR sends\nA telegram or a letter communication to the progressive to nominate lodge Henry Cabot Lodge that was the moment I dropped the book that is right just the way that the the progressive thought what you see crazy yes just about everyone does and and\nThe when he does this as a dodge to get out of the of running as the progressive candidate\nOf people like William Alan White the progressive journalist are disgusted everyone or in the ... either ... talks about how Tiahrt has used the progressive said how sickening\nIt is a large is not a progressive she called it a cowardly staff yes and what she could write you know so many people could write back then I just marvel at how good the writing of the language cowardly\n... you don't want that on your grave okay so Roosevelt doesn't make the correct decision and the convention nomination Charles Evans Hughes is Rosalie are going to campaign for\nWell at first he went went when he gets to the news he is so confused at this point even though everything is done has led up to use his nomination when they give him the news at at a sack of more hilly looks like his dog died and it's like well\nYou won't see me as almost like you won't have to yard to kick around anymore but then he of course goes on the campaign trail\nAnd overshadows the candidate I Can't think of another case where the surrogate has so overshadowed a the official candidate there's an interesting a
