Gordon\nThis move by pump payout to leave town going and fly to Beijing it looks like\nWas unscripted it looks like both sides are being rough on each other did we anticipate this did we see this coming Gordon good evening to\nGood evening John ah I didn't see it coming um I think it was very welcome though the secretary Pompeo was candid and Frank when it got the ...\nIf you look at the words that were issued by the state department as pump pale left for the Chinese capital they were the usual sort of we need to have constructive engagement you know we need to have results oriented diplomacy it was all sort of very um benign\nBut when he got the beach and he said two words which are really critical and he said that we have quote unquote fundamental disagreements with China and that's absolutely right and this was important for compare to say because he's showing the Chinese but we're not afraid of friction in the relationship\nWe haven't been that way for about four decade so it's very important for them to see there's been a pivot in the American mentality towards China that we are willing to assert our rights and the rights of the international community and then we're just not afraid of Beijing anymore\nReally really good move on the part of the secretary of state\nMr Wang began his meeting with Mr pump pale by accusing the U.S of escalating trade friction causing trouble over Taiwan unjustifiably criticizing China's domestic and external policies Gordon this is not about trade isn't this to mean they're not limiting themselves to terrorists here\nNo they're certainly not and and the Chinese are pointing out that across the board the United states has new policies\nFor four decades in the American administrations Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives\nHave actually put the success of China's Communist party as a goal of American foreign policy\nWell Trump is first of all a ticking policies that are under cutting China and he's ignoring China and other policies and the Chinese have got to be extremely concerned because right now the U.S is taking a position which could lead to really severe consequences in the Chinese state\nTrade friction we understand check their the two systems do not work together China practices piracy the U. S. practices WTO but causing trouble over Taiwan that's a new one to me Gordon has there been something new they've been complaining for years is their twist in that story\nWell I think the twist is that the first of all when president firing when of Taiwan um went to South America she made to very high profile transit stopped in the United states the Chinese were happy about that\nThey're not happy about legislation that worked its way through Congress and Taiwan and they're concerned about another set of arms sales\nSo you know this is a one nother level of disagreements between the United states and China and it's good that we're defending Taiwan because at some point we've got to make it clear to Beijing that they cannot fall through the status quo across the street\nBy the use of force and feed your paying has been effectively threatening the use of force for quite some time now we've been ignored him now we are starting to take the position that yes his threats to matter and they need to be countered\nUnjustifiably criticizing China's domestic an external policies Gordon I think that means that we're suspicious when the head of Interpol returns to China and disappears and resigns I think that ... that is what China's sensitive about what's happened to the head of ...\nBefore I answer that John I think that the Chinese were specifically referring to America and criticisms of the detention of about a million acres\nIn John I'm In\nCamps which resemble those um that we've seen in a prior a totalitarian states\nI mean these are concentration camps John these are crimes against humanity um essentially what they're trying to do is to liquidate an ethnic group\nAnd they're doing it in ways that have resulted in the torture in death of leakers this is something that the international community cannot ignore but going to the head of Interpol which is absolutely fascinating\nYou know we've learned that among home way um who was the head of Interpol since two thousand sixteen um went back to China in September he was disappeared I'm now Interpol has received a message that he's resigned there's been a a notice from China that he is being investigated for a serious breach\nOf his wife is complaining she's not in China and she's complaining that she's not heard from him so clearly this was an ambush ship lesson plan\nAbsolutely it wasn't planned and it shows that number of things John one of them is that um the disagreements at the top of the Communist Party have become so severe that they basically broken out into open warfare\nBowling branch guarantees you'll love there she says you can try them in your home risk free for a month plus bowling branch has award winning blankets towels and pillows\nThat are all just his company has their plastic sheets order today and get fifty dollars off your first set of sheets with criminal code John J. away chat that's fifty dollars off at bowling branch dot com with promo code job spelled B O L L and branch dot com\nPromo code job B O L L and branch dot com promo code job\nNo back to the John bachelor show so [noise]\n\n\nI'm John bachelor Thaddeus McCotter joined us from\nDetroit Gordon Chang's here from the east coast and we go to Frazer ... Singapore\nAuthor of red capitalism a gentleman I'll take the first question with Fraser and then we all a phrase or\nA garden I've been discussing the missing in action press the Chinese Communist party member president of Interpol discussing the fact that the Chinese authorities have turned out a long time successful Financial Times editor from Hong Kong discussing\nThe freedom of navigation chicken a game of chicken with us as to cater last week and also puzzling about ... speaking in temp work late to Mike pump pale in the capital these last hours that something happened that you can see from Singapore that we can't see here\nHas ... has as Xi Jinping ceded control of the\nFace of China conquering the world because they're acting right now a unpredictably good evening good morning to you\nThat ... Martin are using the gentleman um I don't know I ... in some ways that I think very ... ... ... ... ... if you understand the nature of the Communist Party and if you understand China but of course from the site it really is quite shocking and the case then tripled cheap\nYou simply could not make that up if you if you had a fictional story but the head of Interpol was abducted affects disappeared by the government for corruption after his government push to put in there just two years ago no one would have believed you\nUm the the visa case in Hong Kong and of course is Betty wedding in terms of Hong Kong freedom we know that aggressive position but he's trying to see there's China is under a lot of pressure at the moment\nAnd many of these things have come at the same time clearly pressure from the Trump Administration has caused part of that you have economic problems I'm sure\nSome degree of political infighting I don't think she did things going to be thrown out anytime soon but the Chinese are clearly straight and they had at the airwaves but a long time and they're not getting it that way anymore and the fact that why you're shading make one pill\nIs basically telling you the Chinese are just really upset and Rocco\nAnd they don't know really hyped it it's fun and change their model\nFraser um the the Chinese seems to have lost the cue cards um\nYou you talked about many things just now I'm One of them was the economy where is the economy at this particular time you had the big reserve rate reduction ratio reduction pumping a lot of money into the Chinese economy more than a hundred billion US dollars\nUm is that a sign that the economy is slowing or is this just a precaution\nOh I think again why does anyone think they're calling me not flowing economy has been going for a quite a period of time\nYou can clearly see a lot of stress and it's not always be although the stock market are very bad day yesterday NATO was being shown in the left the company and our bond default or whatever often a lot of private companies that are real distress you see signs of distress and the property market it does not mean that we're never going to fall off a cliff there's going to be leaving moment per se but\nThere's clearly a lot of stress in the economy we have had you know a huge buildup of credit\nThey try to tighten diner not realizing their problem but they've become so addicted to credit over the past decade or so that it it gives them very little room to maneuver and this is another one of those pressures in that caught me\nAnd of course you saw the Bloomberg story last week about the big pack going right to the heart of that sort of taking the Chinese manufacturing and you know\nEverything basically that is simply no but the good news coming out of China\nThat is a phrase or do we anticipate this unpredictability ceasing anytime soon or is this just something kind of open ended\nUm I live there's going to a ... a bit like the stock market defeated the volatility than I Am I mean again I think what the Chinese are struggling to find is a model itself I knew model and it's not even clear to me that even trying to look for one they have been so use of\nHow to engage with the way have you didn't get your US President understanding this of low and gauge meant policy is trying to Iran rings riding to others um and ...\nWhen they're faced with problems\nYou know they are fighting back and and and the way that they do and the case of Hong Kong but it's fun to be so\nYou know the Hong Kong independence against Hong Kong independence I though the vast majority of Hong Kong or there's only a small number of people talking but I think it's highly unrealistic but the very mention of work yet the\nBeijing rattled Juanita by separatists or to the truck and talk like that and so you have this completely in temperate behavior your complete over reaction as you solve with recent be the case\nUm but this is remember when it comes to the Communist Party loyalty and belief that belief in the party has all that matters so almost regardless if I were ... things up here it's\nLong as the people are supporting the fence are supporting Xi Jinping's supporting the party a lot of giving later rational behavior tank and and your\nFriends your garden tells me that they're putting more money into the economy or some hundred billion or more that's the way they responded to recessions once upon a time is there a recession\nI it's always difficult to really know if it is that the technical definition of protections in place and try to\nThat is is that if a that it's straight they know that they were waiting it under a straight a fallback but at the ... the pumping money into that caught him what's\nInteresting as well as earlier this year with the talk of by a rushed infrastructure projects that to to boost growth and tax cuts to help ... am and so they're going I Love the salt than there is no longer talk of the labor teaching in the economy even though the thick\nThat it's a tremendous amount of credit the basically the gardening that caught him but that they have\nThe state that legitimacy on that caught me continue to go and keeping the whole show on the road so I ... at any of that goes to change course night when you're under such strict garden\nFraser you're quoted in the AT T a day ago um that the private sector and China just exist really at the tolerance of the state sector the things you're paying has been using this trade friction with the United states\nReally almost as an excuse to titan and to increase the role of the state sector you talk a little bit about what's happening and private versus states business at the moment\nWe have about a minute fraction sure very good and look I think one of the key things to understand about China the ... that would appear that\nIt's become over the past ... years or so\nEverything that the discretion of the state and that you have a leader now who is much more focused on a strong central state and very much a strong ... under the leadership of the party\nThat's going to be true in

Trump was down by double digits install ended up winning the election three weeks later\nMr Mr find good evening to you lessons learned from the Democratic party after these last two we good evening\n[noise] well the law of unintended consequences or the Democrats I think at a pretty sound strategy which was the either get to block Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court and see if they can win control of the Senate and uh basically declare the seat vacant for the next two years after that or\nThe rev up their troops through righteous anger\nOr to Republicans so it seemed like a no win situation for them it's now much more mixed as David mentioned [noise]\nUm I have observed mid term elections now for a long time and whether it observed is if the campaign of the last month hinges on issues as opposed to personalities or scandal for something exhaustion is a Republican singer do better if their issues\nAnd with Brett Kavanaugh's victory they have\nThe rule of law they have of the Supreme Court ah they have the behavior of the Democrats to run against\nAnd I think even though district by district it may not affect Republicans' chances I think in general it is given the Republicans issues that will fire up their base that weren't there before before they have to talk about tax cuts and all the stuff that oh well you've done for us already what are you done for us lately\nSo I think the Republicans are revved up and we have a real campaign on our hands\nThat is you have questions for this gentleman\nOf the media learned any lessons from the Kavanaugh confirmation battle David you are male no\n[laughter] well look I mean I'm I I think there was a good reporting during the cabinet are fair and I think there was some bad reporting and I don't think the media is going to be any different than it's ever been uh some of us know what we're doing some of us don't readers and viewers will make up their minds I I mean look I I think the focus on the media is\nA little bit overblown I understand what frustrates a lot of people but you know believe it or not it frustrates a lot of people on the left to just for different reasons so they're going to hate us and that's that's just the way it goes meaning left and right I I just want to do my job\nThis time I think the Kavanaugh controversy represented the clearest possible\nIndication that moving to a British style of journalism we're journalists take sides were some outlets are clearly leaning in one direction and others are leaving and the other direction\nAnd I think that was made explicit us reporters who even though they may have had a semblance of objectivity and they're reporting were declaring their partisan feelings on Twitter\nAnd even more blatantly so because it was such a fast moving story so I think it was a clarifying moment for many viewers and readers in this country that all of the things they have suspected\nI end up almost half the country and the latest he'll newspaper poll says the coverage was tilted against Kavanaugh was unfair up it just accelerated all the trends about media skepticism we've seen these lo these many years\nDavid you're reporting from Tennessee included day I Am a Tennessee a resident who is working for the Democratic candidate for Senate and is unhappy with President Trump was\nAnd I wanted you to comment on that because it seemed a Americans are individual she can't generalize what did you learn from her dad\nBoth fascinating um she's a volunteer for the ... campaign and that's how I met her she is a\nRegistered Republican and that always voted Republican until twenty sixteen and she is somebody that\nHas not a given up her views um even though she's given up supporting a Republican president he's still fiscally conservative socially libertarian a one out of a way to tell me she leaves and the second amendment even though if you have with a you know what I Would label it too many style Pat Toomey so compromise\nLegislation and gun safety um and this even though in the district she is in and suburban Memphis\nShe will not make a difference because Tennessee is just one of those red state that you're not going to see the blue wave blow through even if there is a blue wave she is a quintessential married suburban Republican woman who doesn't like drum\nAnd because she doesn't like Trump is voting for Democrats to send a message and when I asked her about her views but I wanted to establish\nA Republican bona feeding but also to get to the heart of what her she was and she told me it\nComes down to the president's behavior or his compartment in the way she believes he treats people and she said you can't do would be a decent person and lead in that fashion\nThat ... that's enough for me to X. near the KU and she told me she probably would have\nVoted for Bob Corker reelection and she doesn't see why not but just simply because Marsha Blackburn is a Trump supporter will because of the ways you feel about Trump She is voting broader than it is a there are women like this all over the country in districts that matter\nAnd if Democrats win control of the house on November sick it's going to be because of women like her\nA job in the puzzle for me about the Democratic approach to Kavanaugh was that it change the subject for Trump did they do that on purpose did they think that Kavanaugh could be Trump how do they how did they get to a place where they stopped talking about what was helping them which was the president's tweets\nBecause the Supreme Court was so important to them and they are such pressure from their base they had to act and do everything they could just stop Kavanaugh so they thought and they threw everything into it\nUh I agree that many voters are in the position that David found this woman or the other hand the last few days I've talked to voters who say\nWell you know I still don't like Trump but at least he stood up to the bullies\nAre no other president whether it's the name was robbed near Bush would have stood up to the ... bullies they would have pulled Kavanaugh there would be if they could feel the Supreme Court today so well Trump is disliked by these people there's also a sticking admiration that by his message and values stubbornness and by his\nStern is you got something done that they want it done which is a seat of the Supreme Court and they're not going to vote whereas before they were going to sit home\nThat if you're in a blue state with a dominant by Democrats in this cycle was there any change in the attitude towards the Trump during the Kavanaugh hearing that you could discern\nWhen you could see certainly with the Republicans may were very very engaged in this very upset\nAnd I think one of the things you're also see amongst the electorate especially in the ... as you get towards the center is a lot of the tactics that were employed by the Democrat democratic base or their rabid partisans are we're not perceived as well\nAnd they were perceived as forces of Robert Kennedy recalled disorder and lawlessness and those do not play well for the Democrats here with the vast majority of the center here in the state now whether we'll hold off the blue wave I dunno Michigan I think it'd be ... best this election but people are very concerned about the way that the

Islam and its best face\nUm has announced\nAn order that he had ordered the education minister side I'm a I'm Suzie to incorporate Holocaust studies into the country's high school curriculum and this is reported in the press it's ... we've talked about this\nUh we've seen the curriculum and he said education has the power to fight against discrimination is racism\nAs well as the ugly phenomena of anti Semitism this is the king of Morocco and Arab country was repeatedly set this high standard one that is reflected in Azerbaijan as well we're in twenty six hundred years of Jewish existence in the country that was never anti Semitism in the last example\nIs not your more out who just won the Nobel Prize for uh she was a captive taken by Islamic state and sold and slavery in this horrific story we hosted are here in New York she was held on\nAmounts in ... remember in the region of northwest Iraq and\nTerrible things happen to so many in so many disappeared and we're so\nBut she visited Israel in ah twenty Seventeen and she said like the Jews the cities have an ancient history\nAt thousands of years old and despite recurring persecution both people have survived she said my time in Israel showed me that in the wake of oppression and genocide of community can emerge stronger and she is really a model what Nobel Peace prize unlike some others who have received including us there are a fat\nAs it by John Morocco and they use ETs of Iraq who are now the CDs or many countries after the crimes of the Islamic state now we turn now Malcolm puts down is a very proper clothes and puts on his hat puts the bowl with down any reaches into his pouch that is\nYeah when you talk about winning a Nobel Prize you'd like to toast with something can you tell us can you tell us about the world's oldest breweries in right now that way [laughter]\n[laughter] uh well this is the site of and I'm going to be reviewing and the next couple of weeks when God when we'll be back on a regular schedule some really exciting things that have been found but this is in\nThe ... north of ... which uh I'm John visited in which is northern Israel it's served as a burial site for them to to the people and they found there the world's\nBrewery and it seems that they were able to ferment a a different kinds of grain and perhaps used in a burial ceremony it seems that this\nA site was a one we're we're a burials took place they found a platform of flowering plants and they produce a soup like liquid an alcoholic drink\nAnd different than what we know is today's beer but brewing beer was thought only to go back five thousand years but this may turn the history of his head so in a lot of bars now you can have a dispute about how old the um\nThe preventing of beer or was they found these three small pitcher mortars to will use the storage one for pounding the Bering grains and before the fermentation and the the side I'm sure will become a great a visiting side perhaps a great\nPlace where is it again Malcolm review what the geography\nIt's it it was in a cave ... south of ... which is in Israel's north it's the largest city drive but a lot Israel's ah ah north and so maybe a\nWasn't there at city they're Malcolm is\nIt it was the the two feet settlement it was I'm a ... that they believe the people there than the two feet is buried the some of their dead in these in these caves\nAnd that the um the discovery indicates report raises questions about uh about them they they live between the paleo lipstick and the Olympic periods\nAnd um give that gives us insight into what they were eating and discovery of traces of wheat barley based alcohol in this case so it's really very interesting I think it's still a lot more to be found there but\nI'm a lot of people can be hosting it\nAll right a preview Indiana of the upcoming weeks\nWell tomorrow there's going to be a very special announcement and it's a one by the Israel Museum in Israel antiquities authority of of an inscription I have not yet seen it\nKept under real wraps 'em and they're going to announce it tomorrow so next week's report we will have an update on it\nAnd also a review of some of the amazing discoveries including um the bullet the seals with the names of both ... and the profit a show Yahoo ...\nAnd the letters while some of them are not clear by piecing it together they believe that this could have been there ... amazing a connection\nAnd uh the reason we're previewing Indiana's because the overpass try so we just have a couple of minutes here can you go over your tribes India\nWell one of them of course we remember this the the last theater which is I went back to to visit um which was discovered under the western wall underneath Wilson ...\nI remember I remember yes\nVisible structure remaining from the Temple Mount compound of the second temple period and they uncovered this three hundred two hundred seat amphitheater from the Roman period and a eight large or ancient stone courses built of of a normal stones\nAnd this is as I said the last ... charges that once constructed a big bridge that led to the Temple Mount that they would cross over to go into the temple itself and it stands above the foundation of\nThe western wall a and this these discoveries are open up a whole new era underneath that we don't know yet what else\nUh um we were going to find but they considered that one of the remarkable discoveries um it you know it's small compared to the big Roman theaters that that have been found but ... meeting here it could well have been a place where Rome and leaders got together with they held discussions city council or something of that kind\nThat it's about thirty seconds you have a question for India now I have no question other than you know how quickly you changed during the segment from your street clothes into your Indiana close added more than what it was closer to ten times nothing I knew\nThere was a telephone booths here but they they do you remember the story about the toads John and that is so I didn't even get to to remind everybody about the four thousand year old\nTo enjoy some where they found that the uh as part of some sort of a burial ritual uh in the uh that was um a found in the tube itself along with the other uh items that that uh\nWhat what did they find ... Indiana where they find a toads remembered that I have yet to be added frogs they had it from yes we knew that we haven't struck deeply with you right we had to solve the added\nFrogs it's true it's an unusual a mentor I was the highlight in Indiana and he had a whole lot of the world's all those brewery in the day decapitated frogs that is McCotter W.

Marshall used bitter ... of the indigenous people so that that wouldn't happen\nA but it hasn't been that at all but it is truly been that of a war to its guardian and the relationship has been that a meaning that now the\nIndigenous people by and large are considered to be not competing in the same way that we might say but teenagers incompetent and therefore might have a guardian for a teenager\nOr a person with some mental disability so it might have a guardian to prepare to taking advantage of that person\nNow the federal government actually was the guardian to these wards and we literally and the legislation passed much later Eighteen Seventy seven legislation or called them a incompetent until we deem them complicated\nImagine today if I said African Americans or wards of the state because they're incompetent I mean I Would just be\nThat would be ... she couldn't imagine saying those words and yet that's the way we to this day a treat American Indians\nSo we're stuck with early Eighteen century land a language which of course was inherited from the early ... or early Nineteen century language ... heard it from the early Eighteen century language when the quake or the Quakers now I'm not talking about gun and we're talking about Quakers\nWhen the quake her colony saw that there was profit in the ground in the in in the soil and\nDidn't take advantage of so much as they used survey ers and law and the courts and the assembly to us slowly encroach upon Indian hunting ground now we come to\nWhat happened to the Indians the west or the Native Americans in the west the indigenous peoples if I recall correctly Terry there were a series of steps late Nineteen century early twentieth century\nWhere large pieces of territory worst feed it to the Native American reservations and then they kept chipping away so that it got smaller and smaller do I remember correctly\nYou ever that you have a perfectly correct I'll go back to the black sea rows of ...\nOf the black sea reservation was a ... and that was easily three times what it is today\nA until somebody said hey there's a smooth beautiful country up there why don't we call it Glacier National park and the people who really want to do that or a namely the a ... of the great ... which ran through there they wanted the place to take tourists\nAnd so the federal government said that the black sea you know the reservation we gave you well we didn't really mean to give you the west half of that reservation we're going to protect it as a national parks\nAnd here I Can't remember the number precisely but it was around ... million three hundred thousand that they paid them so those those chunk of land or\nSo they did in some sense get paid but\nAgain that was the guardian who was just negotiating a contract with the guardian so the ward really didn't have much say\nSo these loans were were taken away and it through this process for the girl reservation in Montana last significant coal is orders because of the northern Pacific real world road wanted them so they're no different than the story you told about a Pennsylvania they were left them with\nParcels sort of a a seated land that was far smaller than the original territory that was a to B Indian reservations and of course then there's the trail of tears that the Enron and moved to the American Indians moved to the Indian Territory and Oklahoma which is even worse\nTerry symposium most recently in Washington is renewing indigenous economies we've\nWe've put down an outline of the crisis which is going now more than ... we're we're looking at three hundred years here so we there what is to be done when we come back ... percent of the Hoover Institution I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

Ford\nYeah I think there would be tremendous problems for for um professor Ford because I don't think and this is another reason why I think that this doesn't have a chance of actually going anyplace\nI'm One of the astonishing things I think that he is that that uh happened during the hearing and I refer to it in a column I wrote from from the hill by explaining that I you know I come from the\nFederal court rooms in New York or not from the Sigmund Freud theater on Capitol Hill or but they actually have two people who have told diametrically irreconcilable\nStories that the the two versions of events are completely diametrically opposed\nBe figuring out which one is true is vital to how people should think about this controversy\nAnd in where I come from which is the world of a of a prosecution in courtrooms what you would say looking at something like this very simply somebody's lying here and we got to figure out who it is\nA sun house for three weeks Washington they decided to tiptoe around that issue which is the main issue\nSo we got a bunch of psychobabble regarding professor Ford that you know perhaps a she was right about everything she certainly went through a terrible traumatic event she certainly was the victim of sexual abuse of some kind\nBut she's simply wrong about the identity of the perpetrator even though it's somebody she\nTestified that she knew beforehand so this is not I'm mistaken identity situation\nA and she was a hundred percent sure according to her testimony that it was eight or and then on the on the Kavanaugh side of things\nHe was such a compelling witness that nobody dared during the hearing called him a liar to his face so the myths about him is that he had occasionally a few too many beers when he was in high school\nAnd that maybe he committed a sexual assault while he was in a drunken stupor and forgot about it for thirty\nSix years which seems to be to be equally preposterous 'em but they're the unfortunate ... salt of all this is we never really\nHad a\n... a real fact finding proceeding about who was telling the truth\nAnd well Kavanaugh has the better of the argument because a Ford story is completely uncorroborated he\nGets to the Supreme Court with a cloud over him because too many people on Capitol Hill including Republicans conceded the credibility and sincerity\nOf professor Ford's account\nOr even though they they say that you know it must be mistaken identification which is exactly what she says it was it\n\nTo\nHave joined us or this is the John ... show\nThat is McCotter my colleague in cohost W. J. R. and Andrew McCarthy and the national Review Online back to Russia game during the Kavanaugh and ... there was a revelation from the house of representatives\nIt speaks to a principal fact that we did not have until now we believe that it is in the fight the war in the original Pfizer warn of October twenty sixteen probably continue doing all the vice awards including the one signed by Rod Rosenstein\nIn ... in June of twenty Seventeen that is that a man named Michael Saltsman an attorney for Perkins coy ah representing the DNC and connected to the Clinton campaign\nMet with at least once met with a man that by the name of Baker James Baker chief counsel of the FBI prior to the seeking and securing of the fight the war met with James Baker to pass information about\nInterference by the Russians and the twenty sixteen election Andy when this news came last week it received no attention whatsoever even on our a Republican channels because Kavanaugh overwhelmed the news cycle it struck me at the time with my mouth open this this is a fact\nThat we needed for a long time did it strike you that way Andy\nIt sure did it was a and it's interesting that it came out the as you say overwhelmed by the Kavanaugh story because um what this fact is is something that you would not knowing the Kavanaugh story which is called cooperation\nOr this is actually what we've been discussing and talking about all along it goes to what the FBI and Justice Department knew\nAt the time that they went to the Pfizer court and importantly John what they withheld from the ...\nUh we have to underscore here that ... is basically the law firm cut out for the Clinton campaign it's the nexus between uh the FBI and\nThe which caught the ... and the Clinton campaign which produced it so this is a very important development and probably even in in a time when um\nWhen we didn't have an overwhelming story like Kavanaugh or it would have been ignored\nIn the mainstream media is not the conservative media that is [noise]\nAnd he wouldn't miss will come out sooner if we're allowed for the ... the FBI and the Deirdre interviews regarding some of the documents are barely ... believe it was a footnote forty three something like that\nYeah well ... foot no forty three is something that we've we've discussed a particularly at the time when the house\nA report came out the house intelligence committee's Devon new noses committees\nA report or that footnote was very important ah at the time because it was indicative of a lot of the information that the FBI had that was being held back and the the moral of the story back then is that while they were\nYou know ranting and raving about how they couldn't disclose this information because national security was at stake and methods and sources of intelligence would be compromised\nWhat we find it again and again and again is that when they were withholding information it's because it's politically embarrassing and I don't want to say that you know I've I've worked in this ticket I don't want to suggest\nThat there is not national defense information that's important that message and sources of intelligence not important uh to to protect but at the same time it has long been known that the government's ability to classify things\nAnd to have this under this whole ... of secrecy or is a very convenient way to hide or misconduct and worse\nRod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general received a ... a ride on air force one within these last ... hours and the president of the United states speaking glowing Lee of his work and that his work will continue no hand whatsoever\nOr retribution because of trash talk perhaps a mischaracterization of trash talk by Rod Rosenstein and the president and may have twenty Seventeen so we set that aside and I asked is puzzling question about the Aspen revelation\nOr the deputy attorney general had reason to have the five ... in front of him in May of twenty Seventeen when he joined the Trump Administration after all there had been free of them already and he was looking to sign the fourth in that fight the war and he had he had Michael Jordan's name\nI'm puzzled Andy when you have evidence that the public and the Congress has not been told the full truth over the acquiring of the ... and the allegation by the\nBy many that device a warrant process was abused when you have it in front of you are you not charged responsible compelled to reveal that fact as opposed to say keeping a concealed which is what Mr Rosen's dean and his allies have done for Eighteen months\nThey shouldn't be the most transparent people of all John and yet a there is opaque as a as anyone who came before them\nAnd I will say this for attorney general and deputy attorney general Rosenstein I think he tried very hard in his last house testimony not to answer the question of whether he read what he signed off on\nAnd I would I Would caution that the attorney general's signature that to give Rosenstein is do which is not much of the attorney general's signature on a ... an application is a a basically a certification that all of the legal requirements\nUm have been all those boxes in the statute had been checked\nWhereas the when the FBI signs off on it they are verifying your purporting to verify the information in the warrant nevertheless I think in a situation like this\nIf he didn't read every word of that Warren and ask hard questions before it went to the court or that is really a serious dereliction\nDuty and I would also point out or as we've discussed the number of times every single warrant including the warrant that ah Rosenstein signed said that the FBI believes that the the\nThat not only Carter Page who was the subject of the warrant by perhaps other people in the Trump campaign\nParticipated and coordinated in the Russian government's interference in the twenty sixteen elections specifically the cyber espionage that representation was made in the warrant as an assertion that representation was made in the war that Rosenstein sign\nSaturdays and today we see in the ... primary I keep waiting yeah you would think that um we\nOnly have seen the evidence but that ... that Rosenstein would have seen and been aware of the evidence when he signed that warrant in June of twenty Seventeen because that was the fourth warrant they had been at it\nFor you know I mean they were essentially editor for the better part of a year but they had been at it for about nine months\nAnd Michael assessment is not it's not in consequential that Michael assessment at Perkins call I represented that cyber wing of the department and he was connected to crowd strike\nCrowd strike you will recall from your distant memories that Russia gave you for Kavanaugh grad strike is the organization that told us it was the Russians who hacked the DNC server\nAnd pass that information on to bad parties one of whom my or the allegation was was the Trump campaign so soft and Andy fit it's if we've been building a jigsaw puzzle these last year's\nSustenance piece fits right into a missing whole right there right there are we going to get back to this and you can you promised us we've got thirty seconds\nI John like you I Can't promise anything but I Do think that this story a is a white for some new disclosure\nWe'll leave it there Andrew McCarthy National Review online also riding up the hill about the cabinet and brother yeah that is McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great like the name Google\nIs Michael Saltsman SU as as an a and an attorney at Perkins coy much to learn on John bachelor this is the John ...\nAh\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nWhen it comes to the John\nIs driven by big business success\nSmall businesses naturally cluster around the big businesses because those are the lawyers for the customers who see OK I'm going to whole foods will maybe I'll Try to place nearby maybe I'll Try all ... all sorts of smaller business nearby but they otherwise would never even bother to patronize they wouldn't know about them\nAnd it's a puzzle John I Wonder if hardware stores you move and across from Home Depot and say personal experience here will shop for you across the street because one of the\nOne of the wonderful and intimidating things about Home Depot Lowe's is and I I don't know I don't know what all these things are I sort of wonder the aisle and what do you need is a is a guide\nAnd I guess a small business would would satisfy that but I Want to press on this John because this is wholly read\nThat big box stores that big chain Starbucks for example have destroyed mom and pop America\nI report to you because I Do a small business reporter every week\nMom and pop America are doing very well John they've never they've never been happier than they are right now they're hiring they're doing capital investment they're naturally cautious that's all small businesses are but things are really good for them as they are for big the big chains as well so\nWhatever whatever was understood as a negative is no longer press in at least in this economy\n[noise] uh well yeah and and but I think you're speaking to a crucial truth here what's good for big is what's good for small when big is booming and\nPeople are out there buying things and they are seen these other small businesses and they have the means to patronize them\nThere's this notion that the big harmless but know think about it word of the world's poorest regular ... risk their lives to get to they risk their lives getting the United states I arguably one of the most unequal countries on earth just\nThe same where to the small businesses open up shop they invariably open up around the big because where the biggest is where the buyers are that's the driver of their success the conventional wisdom about inequality whether it's in in terms of individuals or businesses is entirely backwards\nAnd this is from Pew Research center the moaning of inequality among Asian Americans what does that mean John inequality\nUm inequality ... of the economic variety as it used to be that Asian Americans across the board were fairly equal from an economic perspective as and they're generally poor\nBut over the in modern times we've seen\nAsians search in terms of their economic success and as a result the gap between rich and poor Asians is grown this oddly is a is a bad sign the Pew Research and they say that\nIn fact it's going to be the driver of a lack of mobility for poor Asians which is never properly explained\nSo I understand now that Asian Americans are extremely good at a set of taking care of their children very very good at taking other children are getting richer\nAnd that's good that's a good thing because that allows them to send their children to ... to private schools and to private colleges and therefore the number of Asian Americans on campuses in America have grown and I'm to regard this is a bad thing John ... this is a negative\nThat's what that's what the research center so they they said that this ... rising inequality is going to make it difficult for those at the bottom to rise up but as they are very study makes clear\nThe Asians are rising and the rising very fast in the United states all an economy as individuals and they're doing very very well so it's never explained why\nThose rising to the top would make it difficult for those at the bottom to cut basically emulate what they do\nUm in fact this is a great story it's a sign that race doesn't factor into one's ability to uh increase one's economic output in the United states that were basically colorblind if the Asians can thrive that's a sign that we don't ever racism problems\nBut there's just no explanation why would the implicit in this idea that um and increasing gap between rich and poor among Asians is bad for the poor Asians is that a\nSomeone to say a black person who's very successful should stop doing that because he would be holding down other black people or the Jewish people who are very successful should avoid six should avoid financial achievements these there are treatments would hold down Jewish people why is it that Asian achievement\nIs going to be a barrier to the achievement of other Asians there is no explanation\nIf it's the puzzling here John might be where I just recognized this talk about inequality isn't inequality an expression of success\nWhen a when a when a country has an economy that's working very well it increases the inequality but of course the rich are the people where the jobs come from so its upside down to say inequality should be a limit\nOn evenly and not merely long enough\nAnd that leads to serious health problems\nSo I decided to do something about it\nI'm Simon out of the un I
