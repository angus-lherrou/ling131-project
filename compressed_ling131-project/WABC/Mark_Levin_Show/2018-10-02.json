what feminism does to your head I had a preview videos come out two days ago David twenty four hours will figure out a million hits on YouTube already it's an attack on feminism\nIs tell me why I dislike them at all not going to play the video 'cause that's not what I Want to talk about but please go on and watch it as selling why I think feminism is a low stupid small minded meaning\nTheory of philosophy that degrades people and we don't need it turns men and women against each other and and look for me I think for most of us for most of us the relationship between men and women are part of the joys of life right and the most\nFor most people the relationship between the romantic relationship the erotic relationship just the interplay between male and female as part of the chief constellations of life right and this is just a\nFeminism has just turned us against each other and made people angry at each other it promotes anger and it doesn't help women and as I point out in the video it's the constitution and classical liberalism take care of the rights of women I women are guaranteed their rights they should be guaranteeing the rights\nThey should I Want women to do whatever they want to do I think feminism degrades their femininity tells them that their feminine desires are bad and that they should have masculine desires and national desires are the only good thing and men have stolen them for themselves that's basically what feminism says\nSo I've been obviously getting all this hate mail and what is fascinating to me about the shape now is all of it accuses me of shame\nAnd that women shouldn't have whatever job they want or shouldn't have whatever job they can do which\nIs nowhere in the video so why did why do people say this why why are they saying it has to be because they have conflated feminism\nWith the rights of women and this is something the press and the left has organized it's brainwashing thing where they would say if you would say I'm at that time as I said why against when I didn't say was against women as a matter of fact in the Seattle that's against women\nSo they just conflate they've conflated these two things they've conflated a philosophy feminism as a philosophy and by the way I you know you cannot say oh well it's not all family as it doesn't matter the philosophy leads to a certain place\nA professor at

in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\n\nIt's not what the constitution created your this progressive movement that became especially\nStrong its earliest period the turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds as it was building in the late Eighteen hundreds and you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy
